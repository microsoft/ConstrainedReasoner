 The sentence contains two parts. The first part, ""Tripel was the strongest beer in their range, in 1956,"" is supported by the source document, which states, ""It was used in 1956 by the Trappist brewery, Westmalle, to rename the strongest beer in their range.""

The location ""Belgium"" is supported by the source document, which mentions ""Westmalle Abbey, Belgium.""
