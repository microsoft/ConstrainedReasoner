 PARTIAL NEUTRAL. The source document states ""Loki is the son of Fárbauti and Laufey, and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr."" This supports that Loki is the brother (male sibling) of Helblindi and Býleistr. However, the gender of Loki is not exclusively male throughout the mythology as he is a shape shifter and has taken female form as well, such as when he became the mother of Sleipnir.

The source document provides information that Roald Dahl was a writer and that his books have sold more than 250 million copies worldwide, but it also states that he lived from 1916 to 1990, which means he is no longer alive and therefore not currently writing books."	1	0
FEVER001192	0	Hypothyroidism can cause mood changes.	0	"These are hallucinations because:
 PARTIAL NEUTRAL. The source document mentions ""depression"" as a symptom of hypothyroidism, which can be considered a mood change.
