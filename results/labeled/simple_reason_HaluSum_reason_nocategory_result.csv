- The sentence's claim that Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership with a fresh face on stale ideas is partially supported by the source document, which does mention Rubio positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership but criticizes him for offering a fresh face on stale ideas, not praising him as the sentence implies.",0,0,1

Although those who try to defend their discriminatory actions using the defense of religious freedom tend to lose, the Indiana law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves thus making it more ambiguous.

- The support from Christians and animists in the North is not mentioned in the source document; it states that Jonathan comes from a Christian and animist South.
- The sentence's claim that the election ""feebleminded other concerns like the country's ongoing power issues"" is not supported by the source document and the term ""feebleminded"" is misused and does not make sense in this context.
- The source document does not mention that Goodluck Jonathan has vowed to support Buhari; it only states that Jonathan's quick concession of defeat prevented post-election violence.

 PARTIAL NEUTRAL. The first part of the sentence is supported by the source document, which states that Jeff Green scored 22 points and Marc Gasol added 19 points in the Memphis Grizzlies' win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. However, the claim that they are now the number one seed in the Western Conference is contradicted by the source document, which states that Memphis moved into a tie for the second seed in the NBA's Southwest Division, not the number one seed. The source document also mentions that both Memphis and Houston are trailing Golden State, which has already sealed the conference title, indicating that Golden State is the number one seed, not Memphis. The part about the San Antonio Spurs defeating the Denver Nuggets by a stunning 30 points is supported as the source document states the Spurs cruised past Denver 123-93. The claim about the Brooklyn Nets continuing their winning streak to keep their final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference is not directly supported or contradicted by the source document, as it does not mention the Nets' position in the playoff standings, only that they extended their winning streak. Lastly, the source document does support that Nikola Vucevic had a strong performance in the Magic's win over Minnesota, with a career-high 37 points and 17 rebounds.",0,0,1

 PARTIAL NEUTRAL. The source document does not provide any information about the current standings or the points difference between Tottenham and Manchester City, so the part about Tottenham being ""seven points behind Manchester City"" is not supported. However, the source document does mention that Tottenham's chances of qualifying for the Champions League appear extremely remote, which aligns with the sentiment that their hopes for a top-four finish were severely damaged. The document also states that Burnley had the best of the chances, which supports the part of the sentence about Burnley coming close to securing three points. The document does not explicitly state that Burnley is a ""relegation-threatened side,"" but it does imply that a win would have lifted them out of the relegation places, which suggests they are near the bottom of the table. The part about Harry Kane's captaincy failing to inspire a win is not directly contradicted or supported by the source document, but it does mention that Kane had a disappointing performance, which could imply a lack of inspiration.",0,0,1

",0,"These are hallucinations because:
 PARTIAL NEUTRAL. The sentence ""Swansea City beat Hull City 2-1 in the Premier League at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday"" is incorrect because the source document states that Swansea City actually won with a score of 3-1, not 2-1. The details about Ki Sung-Yueng scoring after 18 minutes and Bafetimbi Gomis doubling the lead with a volley are supported by the source document. However, the claim that ""Paul McShane got a goal back for the visitors just five minutes after the restart, tapping in from close range"" is partially incorrect; while McShane did score for Hull, the source document describes the goal as him pouncing in the six-yard box and slotting past the goalkeeper from just four yards out after latching onto a free kick, not simply ""tapping in from close range."" The information about David Meyler receiving a straight red card is correct, but the source document specifies that this occurred two minutes after McShane's goal, not three.
