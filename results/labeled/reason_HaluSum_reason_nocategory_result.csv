",0,"These are hallucinations because:
 PARTIAL NEUTRAL. The sentence is partially supported by the source document. The source document does state that the Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, said ""so far no videos were used in the crash investigation,"" which supports the first part of the sentence. The source document also mentions that Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online, said he had watched the video and stood by the report, which supports the second part of the sentence where journalists at Bild and Paris Match are ""very confident"" the video clip is real. However, the last part of the sentence regarding Andreas Lubitz informing his Lufthansa training school of an episode of severe depression is also supported by the source document, which states, ""Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525,"" and ""Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a 'previous episode of severe depression,' the airline said Tuesday.""

 PARTIAL NEUTRAL and CONTRADICTION. The first part of the sentence stating ""A video showing the final moments of Germanwings Flight 9525 has been recovered by investigators from the wreckage site"" is not supported by the source document, which states that the Marseille prosecutor and the French Gendarmerie spokesman denied the existence of such a video in the investigation. The second part of the sentence, ""Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin urged anyone who might have more footage to turn it over immediately,"" is correct as it aligns with Robin's comments in the source document.

 PARTIAL NEUTRAL. The first part of the sentence is supported by the source document: ""when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed 'in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.'""

However, the part of the sentence stating ""the ICC's decision has been met with criticism from some governments, who argue it undermines international justice"" is not supported by the source document. The source document does not mention any governments other than Israel and the United States, nor does it specify that the criticism is that the decision undermines international justice. The source document does state that Human Rights Watch welcomed the development and criticized attempts to undermine international justice, but this does not directly support the claim made in the sentence.

At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013,"" which supports the claim of a decrease in executions and the number of people killed by state-sanctioned killing. It also mentions that ""The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year,"" which supports the claim that governments are using the threat of terrorism to advance executions. However, the source document does not provide a specific number of people sentenced to death as ""just over 600,"" it states ""at least 607 people were executed,"" which is a slight discrepancy. The source document also confirms the sharp increase in the number of people sentenced to death, stating ""At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year,"" which supports the last part of the sentence.

 The sentence contradicts the source document which states that Anne and Margot Frank died at least a month earlier than previously thought and probably did not survive to March 1945.

The source document confirms that the student involved is no longer on campus and will face a student conduct review, which aligns with the sentence. However, the source document does not specify that the incident occurred on Wednesday morning, only that the noose was discovered at 2 a.m. The sentence's claim of ""widespread outrage among students and faculty"" is supported by the source document's description of the march and forum.

 The sentence contradicts the source document in several ways. The source document states that Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on the Republican Governor of Arkansas to veto the religious freedom bill, which indicates opposition to the bill rather than support. Additionally, the source document mentions that Walmart's actions, including its criticism of the religious freedom law and its decision to boost pay for workers, are seen as evidence of growing support for gay rights and a shift in public opinion on political issues. This suggests that Walmart is not aligning with traditionally conservative values on these issues. Furthermore, the source document highlights that Walmart's political action committee has reduced the gap in its contributions to Republicans and Democrats, indicating a more balanced political stance rather than a vocal support of the Republican Party.

 PARTIAL NEUTRAL. The sentence ""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been found guilty of terrorism in the Boston Marathon bombing"" is supported by the source document which states, ""After two days of deliberation, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the Boston Marathon bombing."" The concern about the growing number of Muslims is also reflected in the source document, which discusses the projected increase in the Muslim population. The claim that ""There is a common belief that Islam causes extremism, but this is not true"" is partially supported by the source document, which states, ""But that's only if you believe Islam causes extremism, which many have argued. And that's wrong, of course."" However, the source document also acknowledges that ""there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. Which is true — and false."" This indicates that the issue is more complex than the sentence suggests. The statement ""some Muslims have turned to violence after feeling that their community is under attack"" is supported by the source document's discussion of Muslims reacting to their community being under attack. The need to understand radicalization is also supported by the source document's emphasis on understanding what leads young Muslims down a dangerous path. The mention of young Muslims having real grievances exploited by radicals is supported by the source document's discussion of grievances such as ""dictatorships, corruption, foreign intervention, religious illiteracy, lack of economic opportunity."" The sentence's assertion that ""The solution is not violence but for young Muslims to help their community"" aligns with the source document's argument that extremism is harmful and that a more engaged Muslim community can use its resources to help others. Lastly, the sentence's claim that ""increasing numbers of Muslims are rejecting extremism"" is supported by the source document's statement, ""It's the reason why increasing numbers of Muslims reject extremism."" Overall, the sentence is largely supported by the source document, with some nuances in the discussion of Islam's relationship to terrorism that are simplified in the sentence.",0,0,0

However, the sentence also includes a claim that Judge Jeffrey Sutton's opinion cites the ""rational advancement of government policy"" as a reason for upholding state bans on same-sex marriage, which is supported by the source document: ""He said that the same-sex marriage bans rationally advance a legitimate government policy."" The part of the sentence stating that the opinion is ""dangerous and demeaning"" to the citizenry is a partial quote from the source document, but it is taken out of context. The source document states, ""It is 'dangerous and demeaning,' Sutton wrote, to the citizenry to assume that only judges 'can fairly understand' the arguments for and against same-sex marriage,"" which is a different implication than the sentence suggests. Lastly, the sentence's claim that the decision to uphold the bans is based on the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples in the Constitution is supported by the source document: ""It's an argument made to enforce the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples in the Constitution.""
