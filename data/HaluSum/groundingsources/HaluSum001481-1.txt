Phil Jones has demanded that Manchester United reproduce their recent level of performances ahead of Sunday's derby against Manchester City. United host their 'noisy neighbours' at Old Trafford sitting third in the table - one point and place above their bitter rivals with seven games remaining. It is the first time since November 23, 2013 that the Red Devils are ahead of City in the Premier League table after having played the same number of matches in a campaign. Phil Jones hopes Manchester United 'turn up and play their football' vs Manchester City on Sunday. Jones (left) started for United in their 3-1 win at home to Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon. Louis van Gaal's side are on a run of five consecutive league wins - which includes scalps over top four rivals Tottenham and Liverpool last month. And following their 3-1 win at home to Aston Villa on Saturday, Jones is hoping they can continue their momentum when Manuel Pellegrini's side enter the red half of Manchester. 'Victory doesn't last long enough,' the 23-year-old told MUTV after their win over Villa. 'We've got to move on the next game. It's nice to go into the derby, such a big game, playing well and in form. We need to turn up and make sure we put on another great performance next Sunday. 'City are still a good team. We know what they're capable of and the threat they have going forward. They've got some great players in their squad but so have we. We've seen in the last few weeks and all season really, what sort of team we can be when we turn up and play our football. Hopefully, we can do that on Sunday as well.' Jones (left) will be hoping United can stretch their current league form to six wins in a row come Sunday.
