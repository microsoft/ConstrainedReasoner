Celta Vigo forward Nolito has declared that Lionel Messi should hit the Spanish coast on Sunday instead of risking his foot injury during their La Liga clash. The Barcelona forward has been training following a minor problem, and is set to recover in time for the trip to Celta, but 28-year-old Nolito has urged the Argentine to stay away. 'I guess he'll come, but he can spend the day at the beach as far as I'm concerned,' Nolito told Marca. 'I'll give his dad a ring in a minute.' Lionel Messi should be fit to face Celta Vigo for Barcelona after recovering from a foot injury. Barcelona forward trains alongside team-mate Javier Mascherano (centre) on Thursday. Nolito played alongside Messi for a period at Barcelona, but struggled to impress at the Catalan club that are four points clear at the top of La Liga this season. Celta currently sit 10th in the table, although Nolito insists that his team-mates do not fear Messi and Co. 'The games have to be played,' Nolito added. 'You never know what's going to happen. 'Celta aren't scared of any opposition, regardless of whether they are the best team in the world. We've got nothing to lose.' Messi was forced to sit out both of Argentina's friendlies during the international break. Celta Vigo forward Nolito has declared that Messi should head to the beach rather than playing his team.
