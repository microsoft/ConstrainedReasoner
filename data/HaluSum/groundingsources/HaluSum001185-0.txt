Not everyone should be behind the wheel of a $50,000 car. That's one lesson to take away from a video posted by YouTube user Richard Stewart showing a Porsche Cayman flying out of control as it speeds from a green light on Prince Edward Island in Canada. The sports car swerves wildly before smashing into the concrete median. A wheel even comes off before the car finally comes to a halt. 'Just cause you have a nice car doesn't make you a good driver. Don't let your son drive your Porsche!" wrote Stewart on YouTube about the crash. KHOU reports that police have not made the identity of the driver public but have said that a 31-year-old driver was cited for the crash, leaving the car a totaled as it was towed away. The footage begins with the Porsche idling at a green light. The car booms ahead at a dangerous speed. Almost immediately the driver begins to lose control. The unidentified man verse wildly across the dividing line. The car is twisting at such dangerous speeds a wheel comes loose. Finally the car comes to a halt, a total wreck waiting for the tow truck.
