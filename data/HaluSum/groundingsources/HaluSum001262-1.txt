Ulster have announced the signing of New Zealand international Charles Piutau. Piutau, who can play full back, wing or centre, has agreed a two-year deal from July 2016. He has won 14 caps for the All Blacks, making his Test debut against France two years ago. 'To secure someone of Charles' ability is hugely exciting for us,' Ulster team manager Bryn Cunningham said. New Zealand international Charles Piutau will join Ulster on a two-year deal from 2016. The 23-year-old has played for the Blues in New Zealand since 2012 and has won 14 caps for the national side. 'Our aim is to produce local players with the ability to play for Ulster and Ireland, and then supplement them with top-quality internationals. 'As he has shown for both the (Auckland) Blues and New Zealand, he has searing pace and great feet. He has an exceptional off-loading game and he is rock-solid in defence. 'He also possesses leadership qualities and maturity beyond his years, and that came across strongly in my conversations with him.'
