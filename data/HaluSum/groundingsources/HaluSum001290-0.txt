Former All Black Mils Muliaina, pictured last night playing in Connacht's 14-7 defeat against Gloucester, was arrested after the game in connection with an allegation of sexual assault in Cardiff from March. Married Muliaina is accused of assaulting the woman in a crowded barÂ in the Brewery Quarter of Cardiff city centre after his Irish team Connacht played against Cardiff Blues last month. He was held in cells overnight before being questioned for more than six hours by detectives in Cardiff yesterday. His solicitor Matthew de Maid said: 'He totally denies all the allegations. He has been helping police with their inquiries and he hasn't been charged with anything.' A spokesperson for Gloucestershire Police said: 'A man in his 30s was arrested at Kingsholm Stadium on Friday 3rd April on suspicion of sexual assault in relation to an incident in Cardiff in March. Muliaina is led away by police following his side's 14-7 defeat by Gloucester on Friday night. The former All Black was arrested at Kingsholm and then led to a police van where he was detained. Muliaina's arrest was captured live on Sky Sports following the Challenge Cup quarter-final. 'The man has been handed over to officers from South Wales Police who are investigating the incident.' Muliaina had been playing for the Irish provincial team against the Cardiff Blues on March 6. He retired from the All Blacks in 2011. A spokesperson for the team said: 'Connacht Rugby can confirm that player Mils Muliaina is currently assisting the South Wales Police with enquiries relating to an alleged incident in Cardiff in March of this year. 'As this is a legal matter, Connacht Rugby will be making no further comment at this time.' The allegation is believed to date from Connacht's visit to the Cardiff Blues on March 6. Muliaina has 100 caps for the All Blacks and retired from international rugby after the 2011 World Cup victory. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
