Strike threat: Members of the National Union of Teachers is expected to call for a vote on industrial action this weekend, like the strike here in 2013. The ballot of its 300,000 members would take place after the election, with strikes possible from September. The last time teachers across the country went on strike was in July, when 21 per cent of schools were forced to close – leaving parents having to pay for childcare or take a day off work.

Disruption: Tens of thousands of teachers could strike in the autumn, potentially causing temporary school closures. Members will be asked to consider funding shortages in schools, which the union said would lead to redundancies. NUT deputy general secretary Kevin Courtney said education will face a ‘terrible set of cuts’ if action is not taken. Last month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested schools could see cuts of up to 12 per cent over the next parliament.
