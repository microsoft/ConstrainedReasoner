Stuart Dallas has come a long way since Mark Warburton plucked him from a glorified park and £70-a-week. The 23-year-old, who impressed for Northern Ireland in the week, scored two quite stunning goals as Brentford demolished Fulham 4-1 on Good Friday. They go into Monday's game against Nottingham Forest eyeing more than just a play-off spot. It was three years ago when Dallas was spotted by Warburton playing part-time on a mud bath for Crusaders back home. Stuart Dallas celebrates the second of his two excellent goals against Fulham on good Friday. Dallas has been a revelation this season as he helps Brentford push towards the Premier League. There were those who felt he wasn’t cut out for League One last season, but a three-month loan at Northampton has turned the winger into an integral figure as Brentford hunt Premier League promotion. ‘When I signed Stuart he was training once a week. He’s getting better and better - there’s more to come,’ Warburton said, before vouching for the maligned loan system. ‘Look at Alex Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham. Get the loan right, where all three parties benefit. The 23-year-old starred for Northern Ireland last week, and his manager says it is down to his loan spell. Dallas spent three months at Northampton and has returned to prove himself back at Brentford. ‘Toumani Diagouraga went to Portsmouth [this season], played seven games and was made captain, came back and hasn’t looked back. Likewise with Stuart. They have to go out and get the right loan - it’s a big part of their development.’ Warburton has been doing the sums as Brentford face six games which could end-up being historic. ‘If a team puts a run together they’ll go clear with 90-odd points,’ he added. ‘If they do that, with the nature of the fixtures, teams will drop points. The average for the play-offs has been 72 for the last five years - I think you’ll need 75 minimum. If that’s the case we need two more wins.’
