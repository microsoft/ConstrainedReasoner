Hull City have reapplied to the Football Association to have the club name changed to Hull Tigers after the initial request was blocked. The move angered fans who believed they had won the battle to keep their current when the FA council voted against it by 47 votes to 27. But Hull boss Steve Bruce ahs revealed the club have once again asked FA for permission to rebrand as Hull Tigers. Hull City will become Hull Tigers if club owner Assem Allam gets his way after the previous failed attempt. Hull City owner Allam remains keen on changing his side's name despite fans' anger. An arbitration panel has ruled that owner Assem Allam can make another application to change the name. Bruce said: ‘To be perfectly honest, as I've said repeatedly, the owner knew weeks ago that he had the right to challenge the appeal and he wanted to just go quiet on it. ‘There’s no disputing his views have not changed (regarding the name change). That’s the kind of man he is so we have to respect those views. Hull boss Steve Bruce has revealed owner Allam has reapplied to change the name of his side. 'For what he has done for the club – and I say this repeatedly – he’s put it on the map a little bit and he’s put his hard earned money so he’s entitled to have his opinion. ‘Now you are going to get some, and we’re all traditionalists, that will be opposed to it but hopefully there is a middle ground where everybody can find a solution. 'I think at the moment we put it to one side and make sure that Hull City/Hull Tigers are going to be in the Premier League next year and we can have that debate in the summer.’
