Most fans wants to get their hands on a rare piece of memorabilia once belonging to their favourite player or team and little bits of history can fetch thousands of pounds on the open market. But you may be surprised to know that an expired passport of Paul Parker - most famous for playing right back for Manchester United and England during the nineties - was listed on eBay for an eye-watering £5,000. The item was listed earlier in March and bidding ended on Tuesday but it is unclear whether anyone actually stumped up the sizeable sum being quoted. Ex-Manchester United and England defender Paul Parker's old passport was listed on eBay. The former defender's expired passport was listed for £5,000 but the seller was open to offers. 'This listing was ended by the seller because the item is no longer available,' read the message on eBay. Although the old passport was listed for £5,000, the seller made it clear he was open to negotiation, asking potential buyers to 'make me an offer and see if I accept'. Parker (right) played for Manchester United between 1991 and 1996 and won two league titles at Old Trafford. Parker closes down Holland forward Marco van Basten during one of his 19 caps for England. The eBay seller described Parker, 50, as an 'ex-Manchester United and Chelsea legend' but, while he made more than 100 appearances for United and won two league titles, his grand total of four outings for the Blues doesn't quite merit legendary status. Parker made 19 international appearances but his United and England career ended largely because of the emergence of Gary Neville.
