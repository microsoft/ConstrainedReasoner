Sussex head coach Mark Robinson has warned that wicketkeeper Matt Prior remains 'pretty much out indefinitely' as his recovery from an achilles injury continues. Prior, 33, was badly affected by the problem last summer, eventually losing his England place to Jos Buttler, and has not played since July. He took a break to focus on rehabilitation and admitted 'I could have played my last game (for England)' - and Robinson's prognosis offers no further encouragement. Matt Prior has not played since July, when he lost his England place because of an achilles injury. Prior, seen here celebrating the 2013 Ashes victory with captain Alastair Cook, is out 'indefinitely' 'He's out pretty much indefinitely at the moment. He's still recovering from an Achilles injury which he did playing for England,' Robinson told Sky Sports News HQ. 'It's a blow for him and a blow for us. He's working hard on his rehab. He's in most days of the week. Sometimes it's a bit soul-destroying. As everybody knows, it's been a long injury. 'We feel for him as a cricketer - he's just itching to get playing again - and for the club too, because to have your wicketkeeper batting in the top five would have been such a bonus for us.' Prior admitted he may never play Test cricket for England again after his injury last summer.
