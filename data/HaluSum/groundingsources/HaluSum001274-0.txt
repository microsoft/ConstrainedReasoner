A group of U.S. senators has written to football's world governing body FIFA, calling for Russia to be removed as host of the 2018 World Cup because of its role in the Ukraine crisis and occupation of Crimea. In a letter dated Tuesday and released on Wednesday, the 13 Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers said they 'strongly encourage' FIFA to move the global competition. 'Allowing Russia to host the World Cup inappropriately bolsters the prestige of the (Russian President Vladimir) Putin regime at a time when it should be condemned and provides economic relief at a time when much of the international community is imposing economic sanctions,' the senators wrote to FIFA President Sepp Blatter. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces Russia as the host nation for the 2018 World Cup. Republican John McCain is one of 13 US senators urging FIFA to think again. The lead signers were Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Ron Johnson, the Republican chairman of the foreign relations panel's Europe subcommittee. Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also signed the letter, as did Senator Richard Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate. England are planning a bid to host Eur 2028 after last holding the tournament at home in 1996. Meanwhile, England are interested in bidding for Euro 2028 but are very unlikely to bid for the 2026 World Cup, FA chairman Greg Dyke has revealed. FIFA announced last week that the decision on the 2026 tournament will be made in 2017 - when Blatter is still likely to be FIFA president. The FA has decided not to bid for FIFA tournaments while Blatter is still in power following England's failed bid for 2018, but is eyeing a bid for the European Championship in 2028.
