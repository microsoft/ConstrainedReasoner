Alan Smith has rubbished claims that Liverpool fans attacked the ambulance he was travelling to hospital in following the aftermath of his horror injury during Manchester United's FA Cup 1-0 defeat to their fierce rivals nine years ago. Smith suffered a broken leg and a dislocated ankle while attempting to block a John Arne Riise free-kick during the fifth round clash at Anfield in February 2006. At the time of the incident, reports circulated that Liverpool fans tried to disrupt Smith's journey to hospital by throwing bottles, beer glasses and stones at the ambulance as well as rocking the vehicle. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT. Alan Smith has denied claims that Liverpool fans attacked the ambulance he was travelling to hospital in during Manchester United's FA Cup fifth round exit nine years ago. The horror incident occurred after Smith (second right) blocked John Arne Riise's free-kick. Smith suffered a broken leg and a dislocated ankle as a result of the incident at Anfield. But Smith, who made his comeback for United seven months later, insists that was not the case. 'It didn't happen â€“ fans were still in the ground,' he told FourFourTwo exclusively in the May edition of their magazine. 'I went back to Liverpool a few years later with Newcastle and had a great reception. 'I had loads of mail from fans after the injury, including a lot from Liverpool. And Liverpool's medical staff were great. They were worried that because there was no blood flowing that I could have had a club foot. 'It wasn't Riise's fault and he came to see me. The dislocated ankle was worse than the leg break because I snapped ligaments and there were complications. 'I knew I was never going to be the same player. I've appreciated every game I've played since that injury, I know how close I was to being finished.' Smith was carried off on a stretcher before he was taken to hospital via an ambulance.
