Part of the training is said to involve players taking part in confidential question and answer sessions about previous encounters and is led by a former police detective and a psychotherapist. Four current and former Brighton players were cleared of sexual assault charges in 2013. The four players were found not guilty of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old women at a Brighton hotel in 2013.
