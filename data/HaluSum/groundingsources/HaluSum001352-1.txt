A farmer has captured the adorable moment a duckling groomed a lamb's woollen coat in a 'heartwarming sign of trust and friendship'. Videoed enjoying the sunshine outside, the lamb named Winter stands very still with its head lowered towards the baby duck. Walking around to the front of the lamb, the duck begins pecking away at the lamb's head and neck as if grooming its woollen coat. The lamb lowers its head as the duckling approaches (left) before the adorable scene unfolded (right) Clearly enjoying the attention, the lamb keeps its head lowered as the pecking appears to become slightly more erratic. The lamb appears as though it is about to walk away when it drops to the ground and allows the duck to continue. Behind the lamb a number of adult ducks can be seen walking past in a group as the duckling begins to gently peck away at Winter's face. The duckling begins to peck away at the lamb's face (left) as a group of adult ducks waddle past (right) The lamb’s owner said: ‘What could be mistaken as pecking is actually a heartwarming sign of trust and friendship. ‘The duck pecks out little clumps of debris that gets stuck in Winter's woollen coat. ‘They seem so comfortable with each other that Winter can just lay down on the grass for a nap and let his feathered friend do what he does best.’
