Ben Crenshaw will mark his 44th and last consecutive appearance in the Masters by standing in for Arnold Palmer in the traditional par-three tournament at Augusta National. Palmer is unable to play alongside Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus in the curtain-raising event on Wednesday afternoon as he recovers from a dislocated shoulder, although the 85-year-old will still act as honorary starter on Thursday. Billy Payne, chairman of Augusta National, said in a statement: 'We were sad to learn that Arnold will not participate in this year's Par 3 Contest, but his health is most important. Ben Crenshaw will join Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player in the par-three competition at the Masters. 'We are very excited to welcome him to the tee Thursday as an Honorary Starter, where we will once again honour his extraordinary contributions to the Masters Tournament and the game of golf. 'We are pleased to announce that Ben Crenshaw has accepted our invitation to join Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player for this year, which we felt was a fitting way to acknowledge the end of Ben's illustrious 44 years of competition at the Masters. We look forward to Arnold's return to the Par 3 Contest next year.' The winner of the par three contest has never gone on to win the tournament proper in the same year.
