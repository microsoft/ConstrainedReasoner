Forget the Easter Bunny, it was an egg-laying chick spreading the joy in one household. A video uploaded by YouTube user Shkesi shows a baby girl mesmerized by a toy mothering hen. As the motorized plush bird bounces up and down and pops out an egg, the infant can barely believe her eyes. When the first egg emerges she cries  for joy and when the third comes she lets out a shriek with her arms waving around. Before laying its eggs - which are unfortunately plastic, not chocolate - the toy bird plays a short song. 'I'm about to show you how it's done, laying eggs is so much fun,' it chimes. Caught on camera: A video uploaded by YouTube user shkesi shows a baby girl mesmerized by the mothering hen. Wow! As the plush bird bounces up and down and pops out an egg the infant can barely believe her eyes. After the show is over, the baby's big sister asks if she would like to see it again. The little girl lets out another scream signaling a 'yes' as she sits excitedly wriggling in her highchair. To date the video clip - originally filmed in 2013 - has been watched more than one million times. Shkesi says the baby's 'egg-static' reaction is something that 'never gets old'. Smiles all around: When the first egg emerges she cries for joy and with the third delivery she lets out a big scream with her arms waving around. Encore: After the show is over, the baby's big sister asks if she would like to see it again.
