England ace Joe Hart labelled fellow goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon a 'legend of the game' after seeing the Italian veteran claim his 147th cap. Hart, who passed an impressive milestone of his own by representing his country for the 50th time on Tuesday night, said after the 1-1 draw with Italy that Buffon was an inspiration. Speaking to FA TV, Hart said: 'I’m still learning my game and I’m still watching the likes of Buffon and the way he goes about his business at 37 years old. England and Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart has lavished praise on fellow goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Hart has labelled Buffon, who won his 147th cap against England on Tuesday night, a 'legend of the game' 'I’ve got a lot more learning to do and I want to do it in this team. '[Buffon’s caps total] is a long way off, but it’s definitely a night to celebrate a terrific goalkeeper and a legend of the game, someone I personally look up to and it’s inspirational to see.' The Manchester City shot stopper, who is 10 years younger than Buffon, revealed his delight at receiving his 50th cap at the Juventus Stadium. 'I was proud of my first cap, I was proud to represent the Under 21s, and 50 caps at my age is good,' added Hart. 'I want to keep going, that’s not the end for me. I just want to keep going, keep playing well for my club and country and rack them up.' England ace Hart, pictured saving a shot by Citadin Eder, is desperate to add to his 50 international caps.
