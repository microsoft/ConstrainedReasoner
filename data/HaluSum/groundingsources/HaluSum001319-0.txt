That really takes the biscuit! Celtic's Leigh Griffiths invoked the power of the Tunnock's Tea Cake in his warm-up routine for Good Friday night's game with St Mirren. The controversial striker warily looked round in the dug-out before unwrapping the tasty treat within the first 10 minutes of the vital SPL encounter. His manager, Ronnie Deila has encouraged the concept of the 24/7 athlete by insisting on a strict diet regime for his players. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths was caught on camera enjoying a biscuit during their match at St Mirren. Griffiths was caught in the act on the substitutes bench during the opening 10 minutes of the match. But he wouldn't have been impressed when Griffiths was caught tucking into the biscuit on live TV. Needless to say the Scotland star remained firmly on the bench throughout the Premiership leaders' 2-0 win in Paisley. The commentator on BT Sport asked: 'Are you allowed to do that on the bench? â€“ I'm not sure. Part of a footballer's healthy diet.' Griffiths has always something in reserve. Next time, maybe it will be a Caramel Wafer. Despite not starting for the Bhoys, Griffiths looks content as he tucks into the biscuit on Good Friday.
