Borussia Dortmund's Nuri Sahin claims Arsenal tried to lure him from the Bundesliga with a 'great bid' but the Turkey international didn't go because his family wanted to stay in Germany. The former Real Madrid and Liverpool midfielder, now back at Dortmund, attracted interest from the Gunners back in 2005 when he was playing in the under 17s. 'Arsenal wanted to sign me with a great bid. My family didn't want me to go England,' he told Ntvspor. Borussia Dortmund's Nuri Sahin claims Arsenal tried to lure him from the Bundesliga with a 'great bid' 'They knew that Dortmund would rise again. I'm grateful for this. After the bid, Dortmund realised that I'm valuable. 'The next year Bert van Marwijk put me in the first team. I was only 16. Also [Jurgen] Klopp trusted me. He is a great person. Now 26, Sahin is back 'home' in Dortmund following an unsuccessful stint at Real that included five months on loan at Anfield during which he failed to settle in and claimed Brendan Rodgers played him out of position. Sahin spent five months on loan at Liverpool (left) while at Real Madrid (right) before returning to Dortmund. Sahin also explained the differences he's experienced between the Bundesliga, La Liga and the Premier League. 'The Bundesliga fans like loyalty. Madrid is a bit different, every player dreams about it. Madrid fans are familiar with success. 'They feel excited only by the El Clasico or the Champions League. Liverpool and Dortmund are different, especially Dortmund.' The lofty heights he's experienced at Dortmund have deserted the proud club this season as they spent the early stages of the campaign at serious risk of relegation, though a resurgence has seen them climb to the relative safety of 10th. They face a tough task on Saturday against the league leaders Bayern Munich before a German Cup quarter-final clash with Hoffenheim on Tuesday.
