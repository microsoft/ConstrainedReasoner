Here is all the information you need for Leicester's home clash with West Ham... Leicester City vs West Ham United (King Power Stadium) Team news. Leicester City. Matt Upson is out of Leicester's clash with West Ham as the rock-bottom Foxes continue their fight for survival. The defender limped off in their 4-3 defeat by Tottenham before the international break with an achilles problem and will not be risked. Jeff Schlupp (right) trains with Leicester team-mate Wes Morgan on Thursday but could be rested by the Foxes. Dean Hammond (calf) is out and Jeff Schlupp will be assessed after he played in Ghana's 1-1 draw with Mali on Tuesday with boss Nigel Pearson admitting the winger is tired, while Liam Moore has returned from a loan at Brentford. Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Schwarzer, Hamer, Simpson, Moore, Wasilewski, Morgan, Huth, De Laet, Konchesky, King, Knockaert, Albrighton, Schlupp, Cambiasso, James, Mahrez, Nugent, Kramaric, Vardy, Ulloa. West Ham United. West Ham will welcome Winston Reid back from injury for Saturday's Premier League trip to bottom side Leicester. The New Zealand defender has been struggling with a hamstring problem but worked on his fitness over the international break and is now in contention to face the Foxes. West Ham United's Winston Reid tackles Tottenham Hotspur's Mousa Dembele during a 2-2 Premier League clash at White Hart Lane in February. Hammers' boss Sam Allardyce believes the game will come too soon for Enner Valencia (toe) but the Ecuadorian is back in training whilst Andy Carroll (knee), James Tomkins (shoulder) and Doneil Henry (hamstring) all miss out.
