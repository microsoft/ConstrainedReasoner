World No 2 Roger Federer has been some enjoying some downtime in the snow and posted a picture of himself posing with a snowball and his racket on his official Twitter account. The 33-year-old provided the snap with a witty caption - 'tennice' - and was wearing the scarf of FC Basel, the football team he supports. Federer decided to skip the invariably warmer climates of the Miami Open this year as a matter of 'physical preservation' his agent Tony Godsick revealed. World No 2 Roger Federer poses with a snowball and his racket on his official Twitter account. Godsick told the Miami Herald, 'It's unfortunate because Roger loves Miami and has had success there, but he turns 34 this year and he just can't play every tournament. 'He has to play a schedule that works for him physically, that makes sense with his family, so he had to change it up.' Federer won the Key Biscayne event in 2005 and 2006, but skipped it in 2013 also to lighten his workload. Federer opted not to appear at the Miami Open this year as the 33-year-old aims to maintain his fitness. Federer plays a shot during the final of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells against Novak Djokovic.
