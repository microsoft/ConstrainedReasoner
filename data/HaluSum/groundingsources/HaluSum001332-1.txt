St Etienne want to sign Cardiff full-back Kevin Theophile-Catherine on a permanent deal. The 25-year-old signed for Cardiff from Stade Rennais for £2.1million but has been on loan with St Etienne this season. They have an option to make the deal permanent for £1.5million but Theophile-Catherine wants to see if there are other options before committing. He has two years left on contract at Cardiff.

St Etienne, meanwhile, will not take up an option to sign Norwich striker Ricky Van Wolfswinkel on a permanent deal. The Dutchman scored only one goal following his £8.5million move to Norwich from Sporting Lisbon and has scored six times this season for St Etienne in 31 appearances. He will return to Carrow Road at the end of the season. Theophile-Catherine (right) competes for a header with Montpellier  forward Kevin Berigaud in December.
