Scoring against your old team, and executing a perfect set-piece from the training ground are two of the most satisfying things in football. For Notts County star Ellen White, Thursday night was a night to remember as she managed both at the same time against Arsenal in the Women's Super League. In the 26th minute, with County having been awarded a free kick on the edge of the box, Laura Bassett and Alex Greenwood appeared to mess things up, the former almost running into the latter. Laura Bassett and Alex Greenwood almost run into each other, causing confusion at the free kick. Ellen White spins on the edge of the box and fires the free kick into the corner against her former club. As the Arsenal defence relaxed, the ball was shifted for White, who span and smashed it into the corner against the club where she spent three seasons. 'Thankfully it came off,' White told BBC Radio Nottingham. 'But now we can never do it again, which is a little annoying.' 'We have been working on things a little bit differently in pre-season. I'm pleased it went in because I've skied it over the bar and it has gone wide, but thankfully that one went in.' However, White also missed a penalty which would have made it 2-0, before Arsenal hit back to equalise late on and rescue a point. Arsenal equalised five minutes from time when Chioma Ubogagu netted a debut goal to earn a point.
