A freak snowstorm was captured on video engulfing a bridge and then a river in a matter of seconds in Russia. The incredible weather event took place in Siberia’s third largest city, Krasnoyarsk, and shows the moment snow and sleet plunge the Yenisei River into darkness. A video maker captured the storm, which initially it looks like a large white cloud, from the bank of a river. The snowstorm moved at a speed of 45mph and engulfed the��Kommunalnyi Bridge in a matter of seconds. Suddenly the storm grows in size and begins moving at a speed of 45mph towards the Kommunalnyi Bridge, which it instantly dwarfs with its size. Flecks of snow can be seen in the air as the large cloud becomes increasingly grey in colour and the bridge disappears from view. The video maker then tilts the camera slightly and captures the cloud moving overhead. Flecks of snow become bigger and more frequent as the snowstorm continues to engulf the video maker. Visibility is drastically reduced as the snowstorm engulfs the Russian city in a matter of seconds. The flecks of snow suddenly become larger and more of them can be seen beating down on the side of the river bank. Moving ever closer, the wind begins picking up and suddenly the visibility is next to zero. The video maker then captures a friend standing nearby before returning to film the storm, which the pair are now very much a part of. The video maker momentarily films a friend before returning to the storm, which they are now a part of. The video concludes with more snow pelting the video maker and the grey clouds obscuring the sun completely. According to reports, warm weather is thought to have caused the cyclone, which swept through the city centre in less than a minute.
