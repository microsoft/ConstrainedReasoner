Darren Bent has revealed an Aston Villa return this summer could be on the cards and discussions have taken place. The former England striker, on loan at Derby County, also said Villa were ‘100 per cent’ correct to sack Paul Lambert. Bent, 31, praised Tim Sherwood, who he knows from Tottenham Hotspur, and opened the door on a shock continuation of his Villa Park career even after his contract expires in June. Darren Bent has scored seven goals on loan in the Championship with promotion-chasing Derby. Paul Lambert was sacked by Aston Villa in February after two-and-a-half seasons at the club. ‘There have been conversations with Villa regarding the future and I need to have a think about things in the summer,’ Bent told the Daily Telegraph. ‘I’m not ruling out going back, just like I wouldn’t rule out staying at Derby because they have given me a lifeline to play football and score goals again. We will have to look at it. ‘A club that size should not have had the seasons we’ve had for the last couple of seasons. I enjoyed the first few years but Paul Lambert came in and it all changed, it all went downhill for me from there. ‘He made those decisions but ultimately he’s not there any more and I think it was 100 per cent right, the best thing for the football club. Bent endured a frustrating time at Villa Park while Lambert was in charge as he was left on the sidelines. Tim Sherwood has inspired at mini-revival at Villa Park since taking over earlier this year. ‘I know Tim Sherwood from Tottenham, he’s an unbelievable motivator and it’s the perfect job for him.’ Bent, who has scored seven goals since going on loan to Derby, also praised Steve McClaren as one of the best managers he has played under. ‘He’s being linked with Sunderland and Newcastle and that shows you how good he is,’ Bent added. ‘Whether we get promoted or not, we’ll definitely be trying to hold on to him this summer. He’s up there with the best of them.’
