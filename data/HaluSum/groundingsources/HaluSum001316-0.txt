Sim Bhullar and the Sacramento Kings are about to make NBA history. The Kings are signing Bhullar to a 10-day contract that will make him the league's first player of Indian descent, a person with knowledge of the deal said on Wednesday. The person spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Kings are not expected to announce Bhullar's deal until Thursday, when David Wear's 10-day contract expires and a roster spot opens up. Sim Bhullar is set to become the NBA's first player of Indian descent with the Sacramento Kings. The 7-foot-5, 360-pound Bhullar is being called up from the team's NBA Development League affiliate, the Reno Bighorns. The 22-year-old centre will be on the roster on Friday when the Kings host the New Orleans Pelicans. Bhullar (right) in action for New Mexico State Aggies during a match in Washington last year.
