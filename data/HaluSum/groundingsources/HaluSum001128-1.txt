The purchase was formalised at an Extraordinary General Meeting on Tuesday where the legal team representing Wanda Madrid Investment signed off on the purchase of 726,707 shares for €45million (£32.8m).

Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone speaks to the media. Wang Jianlin, Chairman of Wanda Group, said: ‘Wanda Group is delighted with the possibility of contributing to the growth of Atletico Madrid and the development of its brand in Asia, as well as being able to rely on their extraordinary experience in the training area, which no doubt will be very useful in the growth of base football in China.’ Meanwhile, Miguel Angel Gil Marin, CEO, added: ‘It's a very important step for the club in their effort to build a global leading brand, which will help us maintain the sporting competitiveness of the past years and consolidate among the first clubs of football in the world.’
