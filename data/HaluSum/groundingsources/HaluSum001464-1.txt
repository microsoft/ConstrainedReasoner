Neil Phillips, the team doctor for England's victorious 1966 World Cup campaign, has died at the age of 83. Manager Sir Alf Ramsey promoted Phillips from his role as Under-23 team doctor just before the '66 World Cup as seniors doctor Alan Bass had run out of holiday and could not join up with the squad for their preparation camp in Lilleshall. Phillips, who was born in Tredegar in south Wales, was England's team doctor for the defence of the Jules Rimet trophy four years later in Mexico and left the FA in 1974 following Ramsey's departure.

A service of thanksgiving will take place on Wednesday April 8 in Dr Phillips' home town of Malvern in Worcestershire. The FA said: 'Our thoughts are with Neil's family and friends at this sad time.' Phillips was also with England in 1974, alongside Kevin Keegan (centre) and Mick Channon.
