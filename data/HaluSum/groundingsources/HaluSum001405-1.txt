John Higgins moved into the quarter finals of the China Open with a 5-4 victory over Judd Trump. Trump had a 59 point lead in the deciding frame before being dumped out by the veteran Scotsman. His reward will be a clash with world No 4 Ding, who dispatched two-time world champion Mark Williams 5-2. The Chinese took the initiative in the opening frame with a 68 and from then on never looked back, winning the last two frames with Williams failing to pot a single ball. World champion Mark Selby was also a 5-2 winner over David Gilbert in a low-quality clash and the world No 1 will next face Robert Milkins, who thrashed Michael White 5-1, which included four breaks over 50. Masters champion Shaun Murphy was in fine form against Jamie Jones, whose late rally counted for nothing in a 5-3 defeat.

Murphy will play Kurt Maflin in the last eight after the English-Norwegian player cruised to a 5-1 victory over Robin Hull. Breaks of 76, 87, 51 and 79 helped Barry Hawkins to a 5-3 triumph over Stephen Maguire and a clash with Gary Wilson, a convincing 5-1 winner over Dechawat Poomjaeng.
