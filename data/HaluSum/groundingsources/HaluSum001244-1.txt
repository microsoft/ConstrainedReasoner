Tiger Woods has been spotted hitting balls on the practice range at Augusta National, increasing hopes the former world No 1 will confirm his appearance at this year's first Major. Woods has not appeared on the PGA Tour since withdrawing from the Farmers Insurance Open on February 5 with a recurrence of his back problems. He has since taken a leave of absence in a bid to return to form, but there has been speculation he will return for the Masters, a tournament he has won four times. Tiger Woods was spotted practising at Augusta on Tuesday and is said to have returned to the course. Woods has dropped out of the top 100 for the first time in almost 19 years. Tiger Woods made his first appearance at the Masters as a 19-year-old back on April 3, 1995. Woods said he was not impressed by the iconic venue when he first drove through the gates. He said: 'When I first arrived here — Magnolia Lane, is that it? — I thought that it was a pretty short drive. 'From what everyone says, it’s majestic and a long drive, you can’t believe it, and this, that and the other.' Tiger played 18 holes at the course on Tuesday and insiders from the Golf Channel say he has now returned to the venue for a practice session. Woods did not play last year's Masters following back surgery - the first time he had missed the event since he first played it in 1995. On Monday, Woods dropped out of the top 100 in the world rankings for the first time in almost 19 years. The 14-time major winner did not record a top-10 finish in nine starts in 2014, and has missed three cuts and withdrawn twice in his last six Tour starts. Woods' last title came at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational in August 2013. Woods, pictured driving off the 10th tee in April 1995, made his Masters debut 20 years ago. Woods has won the Masters on four separate occasions with his last win coming in 2005.
