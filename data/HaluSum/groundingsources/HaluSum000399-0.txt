Larry Upright died just one day after Hillary Clinton announced she was running for president. And in his obituary, his family made just two requests: please donate to a children's hospital, and please don't vote for Clinton. Upright, a staunch Republican, died Monday at a North Carolina hospital. He was 81. "In lieu of flowers, memorials may be sent to Shriners Hospital for Children," his obituary reads. "Also, the family respectfully asks that you do not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. R.I.P. Grandaddy." Daughter Jill McLain said it was natural to put that line in her father's tribute. "He was very passionate about politics and probably passed a little of that on," she told CNN affiliate WSOC. Son Michael Upright said he knew his father would enjoy the request. "We know he's up there giggling right now, just laughing out loud," he told WSOC. Upright's passions included much more than just politics. His greatest joy was his family, and he was a former Shriner of the Year at the Cabarrus Shrine Club, according to his obituary. After retiring from the building automation industry, he became an avid golfer. But it's the last few lines of his obituary that is spurred comments from across the country. "You have my solemn promise I will not waste a vote on Hillary Clinton," Marina Shear of Dallas wrote in the obituary's online guestbook. "You were a wise man, Larry Upright," said Ron Renno of Forsyth, Georgia. "I will remember your request in November 2016. Rest in peace, Sir." Nigel Dufont of Kannapolis, North Carolina, offered his condolences but said he wouldn't budge on his support of Clinton. "So sorry to hear about Larry, but I am still voting for Hilary!" he wrote. And an anonymous commenter stayed open-minded to whoever might enter the field. "May you rest in peace. I will vote for Hillary if she is the best candidate."
