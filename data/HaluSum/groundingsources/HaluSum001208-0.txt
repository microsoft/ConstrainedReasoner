Raheem Sterling has admitted he is not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool deal despite being offered a Â£100,000-a-week deal to stay with the Merseyside club. The 20-year-old wideman edged closer towards an Anfield exit after revealing in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday that he would have signed for a lot less a year ago. However, despite being one of Liverpool's star men, Sterling has struggled to repeat the impressive form he showed for the Reds last season. The England international has managed just six goals this season - one less than Stoke frontman Jon Walters - while his conversion rate and minutes per goal ratio have worsened as the graphic below shows.
