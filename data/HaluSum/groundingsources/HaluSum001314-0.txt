Somerset's new limited-overs captain Alfonso Thomas has agreed to coach Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League this month. Veteran seamer Thomas, still recovering from a broken ankle, is not yet fit for selection for Somerset's first LV= County Championship fixture at home to Durham - and is therefore free, with his club's blessing, to take up the short-term coaching appointment with Delhi until April 16. Veteran Somerset seamer has agreed a deal to become Delhi Daredevils coach in the Indian Premier League. Somerset director of cricket Matthew Maynard said: 'The chance arose for him to take on a short-term coaching role at Delhi - which is great experience, should he wish to move into coaching in the future.' Thomas will continue his rehabilitation in India in the hope of being fit again in time for Somerset's second championship fixture against Middlesex at the end of this month. He said: 'I have enjoyed my time as a player in the IPL, and this is a great opportunity to gain coaching experience in the short term - and to work with Gary Kirsten - which I am really looking forward to'.
