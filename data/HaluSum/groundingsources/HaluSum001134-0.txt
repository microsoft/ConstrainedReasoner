Deva Joseph, 14, was left in floods of tears at London Stansted airport (pictured) after being told she would not be allowed to take her flight home to Spain. She initially ran into problems when she was unable to squeeze her handbag into her suitcase. The plane left without her and she had to rearrange her plans to fly home the next day. Deva's father Stefan Joseph, of Santander, northern Spain, described easyJet as 'a disgrace'. The Daily Mirror reports that the airline has since apologised adding: 'Whilst our policy is not to take cash at the gate, we should have made an exception.'
