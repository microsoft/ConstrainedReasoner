Mauricio Pochettino has given Harry Kane his blessing to play in the European Under 21 Championships this summer.

Harry Kane, in action for England against Italy, will play for the U21s at this year's European Championships. Kane made his first start for England against Italy after coming off the bench, and scoring, against Lithuania. Nevertheless, Pochettino has given Kane the green light to participate in the competition despite the striker's workload. 'I think that we have eight very important games ahead and we have time to think about a lot of things that happen in the future. 'Can he play for the Under 21s? Why not? We want to help the national team, the player and we have a very good relationship. We need to share the decision. The first is the player, the FA and us.

Kane, pictured in action against Leicester in March, has been hugely impressive for Tottenham this season. But Pochettino insists he will have the final say on whether Kane makes the long-haul post-season trip to Australia and Malaysia. 'He is our player and after if I decide he is in the squad to go to Sydney, it's our decision. But I think we have time to speak in the future about that.' Meanwhile, Hugo Lloris will miss Saturday's clash against Burnley with a gashed knee sustained in the win over Leicester before the international break. Kane, celebrating after he scored against Arsenal in February, will be available to play for the Under 21s.
