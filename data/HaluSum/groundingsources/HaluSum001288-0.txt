In the post, which has gone viral after being photographed and put online, the man sets out his requirements and offers 'a way of life with quality'. 'John' who is reportedly a builder posted this advert in his local newsagents, it has since gone viral after it was spotted by a passer by. John posted his advert, which is written in capital letters in black pen, in the window of his local newsagents in Muswell Hill. It reads: 'John looking for a companion an apprentice / worker / lover for a craft that will change your life and bring you a way of life with quality. It then details a phone number and says: 'Contact... Or call me for interview must be female between 30yrs - 40yrs.' Unfortunately for prospective lovers, John did not specify precisely what the 'craft' referred to was.
