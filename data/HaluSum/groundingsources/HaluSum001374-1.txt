Gearing up for tonight's NCAA championship game, a group of meerkats have been testing out their basketball skills. The critters were filmed at Indiana's Indianapolis Zoo after getting a makeshift backboard and hoop installed in their pen. Footage shows them inquisitively inspecting the piece of sports apparatus and standing  tall on their back legs. However, instead of an even-surfaced court, they're forced to contend with the hilly floor of their enclosure. Spectators were seen smiling as they watched the team of animals in action. The zoo put on a range of Final Four activities over the weekend for visitors including a basketball-theme scavenger hunt. March Madness is set to come to a close tonight as the Wisconsin Badgers and Duke Blue Devils go head-to-head at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
