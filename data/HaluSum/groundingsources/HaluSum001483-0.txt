Scotland's Bradley Neil has received the backing of world No 1 Rory McIlroy as he ponders when to turn professional. Winning the Amateur championship at Royal Portrush last year secured Neil invites to the Masters and US Open in 2015, with the Walker Cup another important date on the calendar. However, the 19-year-old Scot admits he may turn professional before September's clash with the United States at Royal Lytham and impressed McIlroy during their practice round together at Augusta on Monday.

The Scot pens his scorecard as McIlroy practices his putting ahead of his grand slam bid. 'I rate his game really highly,' said McIlroy, who was on the losing side in the 2007 Walker Cup. 'He looks ready. He's very impressive. Hits it a long way, doesn't seem to be in awe of anything. 'So I just told him to go out there and enjoy it. Don't second guess yourself, commit to your shots, be decisive, all the things I tell myself. McIlroy has tipped the youngster to be a success when he decides to turn professional. 'If he feels ready (to turn professional), then he should go ahead and do it. He's definitely got the game. Even though he grew up playing links golf he hits it quite high and he can flight it; I can see him one day coming over here and doing well on the PGA Tour. He has the game for the style of golf to suit playing over here.'
