Kevin Pietersen has announced plans to begin his season with Surrey against Oxford MCCU in The Parks. Pietersen, hoping to press for an England recall through weight of runs in the LV= County Championship, signed a new contract with Surrey last month. The 34-year-old was given fresh hope of a return to Test cricket, after his sacking last year, when incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted in a broadcast interview that it was a possibility. Kevin Pietersen posted this photo on Twitter and wrote 'Nothing good comes from walking at full pace into a tree! #faceplant' Pietersen is set to play against Oxford MCCU in The Parks as he prepares for the new season with Surrey. The record-breaking batsman is therefore expected to feature in his first championship match since 2013, against Glamorgan on April 19. But before then, he intends to turn out too against Oxford in a three-day match starting on April 12. Responding to a question on persicope.tv, Pietersen said: 'I think I am going to be playing at Oxford, just to get some overs in my legs.' Pietersen is returning to the Surrey team for his first Championship appearance since 2013. Pietersen (right) in action for Surrey in a Natwest T20 Blast semi-final at Edgbaston last year.
