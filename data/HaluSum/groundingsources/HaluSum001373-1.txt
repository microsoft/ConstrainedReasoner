David Luiz could be a doubt for Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League clash with Barcelona after picking up a hamstring injury on Sunday. The Brazilian defender went off after 35 minutes of PSG's 3-2 win over Marseille after suffering an injjury to his left leg. Shortly after his side had fallen behind in their top of the table clash,the Brazilian was running away from a Marseille player, before being caught by a stray leg. David Luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays, but one such run led to his injury. The Brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced. The former-Chelsea defender attempted to continue breaking forward, but pulled up sharply holding his hamstring a couple of yards later. The club's official English Twitter account confirmed it was a muscle pull, tweeting: '@DavidLuiz_4 crumples to the floor with a hamstring pull #OMPSG' Reports suggest the 27-year-old will have scans on Monday to assess the extent of the injury. If it is serious as suggested then Luiz will surely be a doubt for PSG's upcoming games with Saint-Etienne, Bastia and Barcelona, whom the French side face in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on April 15. in his absence the French champions looked less than assured, conceding a second poor goal just a few minutes after Luiz departed, but they rallied to win the game and return to the top of the table with a better second-half display. Luiz limped off, and could now be a doubt for the Champions league quarter-final against Barcelona. PSG will hope their star defender can recover quickly, as he is a key part of their plans.
