A New York City detective has been suspended after being accused of stealing $3,000 during an illegal cigarettes raid, according to police spokesman Stephen Davis. Surveillance video obtained by CNN affiliate News 12 Brooklyn appears to show Det. Ian Cyrus stashing cash in a bag before leaving the Yemen Deli and Grocery store in Brooklyn last Friday. The detectives had arrested two employees for selling loose cigarettes, according to News 12 Brooklyn. Ali Abdullah, the store's manager, noticed the money was gone from a box, but assumed it was taken by one of his employees. When he checked the cameras he couldn't believe what he saw, he told News 12 Brooklyn. Cyrus, who is under investigation by the internal affairs bureau, could not be reached for comment. His supervisor Sgt. Fritz Glemaud, who was heading the raid, was placed on modified duty, Davis said.
