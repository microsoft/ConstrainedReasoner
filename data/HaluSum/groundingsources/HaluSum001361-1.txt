Everton stars Leighton Baines and Luke Garbutt visited Alder Hey Children’s Hospital on Wednesday to spread some Easter cheer for the young patients and their families. The Toffees duo handed out Easter eggs and posed for photographs in the wards of the West Derby hospital following their training session on Wednesday. Speaking during the visit, Baines said: 'Us visiting with chocolate eggs can feel pretty insignificant in comparison to what the kids are going through, what they’re in here for and the period of time they’ve been here, but then you speak to some of the parents, they really appreciate you just coming in and breaking the day up.

'Some of the kids I recognised from when we visited at Christmas and they haven’t been home since so every day is the same and it’s really tough for them. 'You see unbelievable strength and character here, you look at what some of the kids are going through, it’s so tough and yet they’re still smiling. Hopefully we’ve brightened the day up even if it’s just for a short period of time.' Garbutt and Baines will now be turning their attention to Everton's Premier League clash against Southampton on Saturday. Roberto Martinez's side have endured a difficult season, but will head into the match on the back of two consecutive victories against Newcastle and QPR. Everton and England defender Baines talks to a young patient after giving her several Easter eggs. Baines hailed the 'unbelievable strength and character' of the children at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital. The 30-year-old will be back in action for Everton on Saturday following his spell with England.
