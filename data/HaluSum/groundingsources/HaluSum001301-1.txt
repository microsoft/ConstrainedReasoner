Kim Sei-young will take a three-shot lead into the final round of the ANA Inspiration after carding a three-under-par 69 in California on Saturday. The South Korean, who led by two shots at the halfway stage at Mission Hills Country Club, birdied the first hole before a bogey at the par-three fifth halted her progress. Kim returned to one-under par for the round when she picked up a shot at the par-five ninth, before successive birdies on the 16th and 17th moved her to three under-par for the day and 10 under overall.

'That's why I feel I want it so much more, and I think the opportunity is there in front of me, and if I can, I definitely want to get my hand on it, and for sure it won't be bad jumping into that pond tomorrow.'
