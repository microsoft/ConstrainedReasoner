One Israeli citizen was killed and another injured in what police are calling a suspected terror attack Wednesday night near Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Israel Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said a 37-year-old Arab motorist from East Jerusalem struck two people standing at a bus stop in the French Hill section of the city. One victim, identified by police as Shalom Yohai Cherki, 26, died at the hospital. A 20-year-old woman remains in serious condition, according to Rosenfeld. The driver has been arrested and is under investigation by the General Security Services. "From the investigation and first findings, there is a strong suspicion that we're talking about a terror attack," Rosenfeld said. Amid the ongoing investigation, a magistrate court has issued a gag order on details of the incident.
