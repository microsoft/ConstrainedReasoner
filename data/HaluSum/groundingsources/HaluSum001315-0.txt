Moeen Ali is planning to join England for the latter stages of their Test tour of the West Indies, as his side injury continues to improve. The off-spinning all-rounder hurt himself during England's failed World Cup campaign, and was therefore not available when the selectors chose the Caribbean squad. Moeen Ali trudges off after being dismissed against New Zealand during the World Cup. Moeen enjoyed a successful introduction to Test cricket last summer, picking up 22 wickets in seven Tests. They nonetheless left open from the outset the possibility of Moeen joining up later in the month-long trip, for which James Tredwell and the uncapped Adil Rashid are instead the initial frontline spin options. As England prepared to fly west on Thursday, Moeen revealed he expects to be fit again in time for Worcestershire's first LV= County Championship match at home to title-holders Yorkshire on April 12. He told Cricinfo: 'I'm hoping to play that game against Yorkshire, prove my fitness and fly immediately afterwards.' Adil Rashid (left) and James Tredwell are current spinning options in the squad to tour West Indies.
