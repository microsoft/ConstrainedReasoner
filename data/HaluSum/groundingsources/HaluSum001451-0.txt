Mauricio Pochettino wants talks with the FA before approving Harry Kane’s involvement in the forthcoming European Under 21 Championship. Sportsmail understands Tottenham have major concerns about the striker playing in the summer — and will convey those views to Wembley chiefs. England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed this week that Kane will be available for the competition in the Czech Republic, despite playing for the seniors in recent clashes against Lithuania and Italy. Harry Kane celebrates after opening his account against Lithuania in his England senior debut. Kane could find himself at the centre of a club vs country row ahead of the U21 European Championships. But Spurs fear Kane may suffer burnout and see him as key to the club’s PR strategy ahead of their post-season tour of Australia and Malaysia. Pochettino, who confirmed Hugo Lloris will miss tomorrow’s clash against Burnley with a gashed knee, said: ‘Can he play for the Under 21s? Why not? But Harry Kane is our player and if I decide he is in the squad to go to Sydney, it is our decision. ‘There is a lot of things to discuss with the FA, with Gareth Southgate, with us, but always we try to find the best for the player, and for the national team and what is logical for Tottenham.’ Mauricio Pochettino wants to meet with the FA before making any decision on Kane's availability. Kane, pictured in action against Leicester in March, has been hugely impressive for Tottenham this season.
