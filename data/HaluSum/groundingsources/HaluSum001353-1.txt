Tyler MacNiven became known to millions when the aspiring filmmaker won the ninth season of The Amazing Race, and a $1million prize, and now it seems he may have used some of that money to create one epic save the date. MacNiven and his fiancee, Kelly Hennigan, made a three-minute film to give friends and family a heads up on their fast approaching nuptials, and the two went all out in the process. The video, inspired by action films, shows the two literally saving 'the date' as they wash up on shore, fight friends disguised as villains and ultimately escape from one very large explosion. And, most importantly, it lets everyone know they should not make plans for September 26, 2015. Scroll down for video. Tyler MacNiven, who won the ninth season of The Amazing Race, filmed a save the date for his upcoming wedding. In the video, MacNiven and his fiancee Kelly Hennigan battle friends and in the end escape one very large explosion. The couple's wedding will be on September 26, 2015, though the video fails to say where the ceremony will take place. The video ends with the couple, dressed in a tuxedo and wedding dress, enjoying a boat ride with friends under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. And while MacNiven was able to use his Amazing Race experience to film the action-packed clip, Hennigan also had something to draw from as her brother is WWE superstar John Morrison. Now word yet if the save-the-date video, which first appeared in the site Broke Ass Stuart, also comes with a magnet for guests to put on their refrigerator.
