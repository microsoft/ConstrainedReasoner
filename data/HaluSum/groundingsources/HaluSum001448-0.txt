Michael Carrick's outstanding second-half performance for England against Italy on Tuesday night has put him on course to become the longest-serving outfield player to represent the Three Lions behind Sir Stanley Matthews. Carrick made his England debut against Mexico in May 2001 as a teenager with West Ham United and if – as now seems likely – he carries through to Euro 2016, he will be the first non-goalkeeper since the legendary Sir Stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years. Matthews won his 54 England caps over a 23-year period between 1934 and 1957, interrupted of course by the Second World War. Michael Carrick's appearance for England against Italy on Tuesday night keeps him in the longest-serving list. Carrick has played for England for 13 years, 310 days - while Sir Stanley Matthews reached 22 years, 228 days. Sir Stanley runs with the ball in action for England against Brazil at Wembley in an international friendly. Stanley Matthews (1934-57) 22 yrs, 228 days. Peter Shilton (1970-90) 19 yrs, 224 days. Frank Lampard (1999-2014) 14 yrs, 257 days. Steven Gerrard (2000-2014) 14 yrs, 23 days. David Seaman (1988-2002) 13 yrs, 335 days. Michael Carrick (2001- ) 13 yrs, 310 days. ...AND THE LEGENDS HE OVERTOOK. David Beckham (1996-2009) – 13 yrs, 43 days. Sir Bobby Charlton (1958-70) 12 yrs, 23 days. Bobby Moore (1962-73) 11 yrs, 178 days. Gary Lineker (1984-1992) 8 yrs, 22 days. Carrick was hailed by Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney as 'the best player on the pitch by a mile' after the 33-year-old was introduced as a half-time substitute in Turin and helped Roy Hodgson's men fight back to earn a 1-1 draw. His longevity already surpasses that of great names like Sir Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore, David Beckham and Gary Lineker and if he continues to play in the next European Championship he will overtake Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard too. The only player to have had a longer career since Matthews is goalkeeper Peter Shilton who played for England between 1971 and 1990. It also begs the question why Carrick, who has won four Premier League titles and the Champions League with Manchester United, has been used so sparingly by his country at international tournaments. He played once at the 2006 World Cup in a 1-0 victory against Ecuador, was in the squad but never played by Fabio Capello in the disastrous 2010 campaign in South Africa, and wasn't even selected by Roy Hodgson last year in Brazil, even though England's perennial problem has been keeping the ball. With Rooney now captain and clearly a huge fan of the midfielder, it seems unlikely Carrick will be overlooked again and is now finally getting the recognition he deserves. The 33-year-old may still have a few years left but remains a long way off Sir Stanley's record.
