This dog certainly is his master's best friend after saving him from a cold and muddy grave. The black pooch was filmed in action as he took a rescue rope out to his owner at the Clarence J. Brown Dam and Reservoir in Springfield, Ohio, on Saturday afternoon. Footage shows the unidentified man then being hauled to shore by firefighters after spending almost two hours in waters hovering around zero degrees Celsius. He apparently got stuck waist-deep in mud while recovering some duck hunting gear. Luckily, he had a cell phone on hand to call 911. However, first responders were unable to get a boat out to him because the river was too shallow. They also didn't want to send anyone into the pond in fear that they would get stuck too. That's when they had the idea to send the dog in with a rescue rope. Go fetch: This dog certainly is his master's best friend after saving him from a cold and muddy grave. The black pooch was filmed in action as he took a rescue rope out to his owner at the Clarence J. Brown Dam and Reservoir in Springfield, Ohio, on Saturday afternoon. All hands on deck: Footage shows the unidentified man then being hauled to shore by firefighters after spending almost two hours in waters hovering around zero degrees Celsius. Wrong move: He apparently got stuck waist-deep in mud while recovering some duck hunting gear. According to the Springfield News-Sun, the man remained in good spirits throughout his recovery and didn't suffer any injuries. Assistant Fire Chief Rick Hughes said that if the ordeal had gone on much longer it could have proved fatal. 'It’s a good thing he had his cellphone considering he was in the mud and water to about his chest and it was about 33 degrees [Fahrenheit],' he added.
