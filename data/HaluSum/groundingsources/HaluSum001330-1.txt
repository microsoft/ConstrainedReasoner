Thiago came on for his first appearance in over a year against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. The Spanish midfielder celebrates with Bayern Munich team-mates after their 1-0 win at theÂ Westfalenstadion. 'It's crazy. I have to thank everyone: the club, the coaches, my team-mates. They've all been really supportive,' he told Bayern's official website. 'The fans have helped me. It was an emotional moment. I'm very happy. 'Some people think football is just a game, but when I saw how emotional the fans were, I knew: football is my life.' Thiago admits he is still far from full fitness but is now hoping to get back into the side as Pep Guardiola's men continue their hunt for the treble. 'I'm not ready for 90 minutes, I felt tired after 10!' he added. 'My goals haven't changed: to win games and win titles.' Thiago came on for Philipp Lahm and admitted he barely felt fit enough to play 10 minutes.
