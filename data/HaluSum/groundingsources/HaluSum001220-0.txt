A pug has made a miraculous recovery after he was bitten in the face by a rattlesnake. Dug and his owner, Lindsay Castro, were hiking on the Jurupa Hills trail in Fontana, Canada, on Thursday when they heard a rattling sound. Lindsay backed away, but Dug ran up to the reptile - and suffered the consequences. The snake bit Dug in the face, and his face instantly ballooned to twice its size. Scroll down for video. Horrific: Dug the pug's face swelled to twice its size after he was bitten in the face by a rattlesnake. Curious pup: He had been hiking with his owner when he ran toward a rattle sound - and suffered for it. With limited time, the pair rushed to California Veterinary Specialist Hospital in Ontario, where he was given an entire vile of venom antidote. Finally, after two days of round-the-clock IV fluid and treatment, he is ready to go home. 'I thought I'd lost my dog,' Lindsay told KTLA. 'I was so scared.' Relieved: Owner Lindsay Castro thought she had lost her pet as they rushed to the hospital for treatment. Painful: This is Dug's neck after two days of intensive antidote treatment which massively reduced swelling. Forlorn: It has been a heavy few days for Dug, who was struck on one of the first days of rattlesnake season. 'It was huge': Lindsay described her shock at seeing the 'huge' reptile leap out of the bushes in Fontana. Canada's rattlesnake reason runs from April to September. Speaking to KTLA, Dug's vets issued a warning to other pet owners that animals do not have the same instincts as humans when they see a snake. Fontana Police have also released guidance for dog walkers, ordering people to keep animals on a six-foot leash and seek immediate treatment in the case of a snakebite.
