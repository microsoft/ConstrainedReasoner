Kevin de Bruyne's agent has denied a deal in his place for his client to leave Wolfsburg in the summer but admitted that a number of clubs are keeping an eye on the Belgian star. De Bruyne has become one of the hottest prospects in European football after starring in the Bundesliga - being linked with Manchester City and Bayern Munich. Speaking to FOCUS Online, Patrick De Koster revealed that the midfielder is a wanted man but no deal for a move away is in place. Kevin de Bruyne (right) is wanted by a host of clubs but no transfer away from Wolfsburg has been agreed. He said: 'There are always interested teams and there has been some informal contact. 'People have asked me how Kevin is doing, how he has been developing superbly and putting in good performances. That is only normal in situations like this. There have not been any concrete offers, though. German champions Bayern, along with City and Manchester United are known to have watched De Bruyne but De Koster is keen to speak to Wolfsburg and show them the respect he feels they deserve. The Belgian is one of the hottest prospects in European football after starring for his side this season. 'I can assure you there have not been any talks with Bayern Munich. When you want to know whether Bayern are interested in signing Kevin, you should ask [sporting director] Matthias Sammer or [technical director] Michael Reschke. It is true that I have worked with Reschke before, but that does not mean anything now. 'We will sit down with Wolfsburg first, that is a matter of respect. They supported Kevin during a difficult period, when he was unhappy at Chelsea.' Since leaving Chelsea, De Bruyne has established himself as one of the best playmakers in the Bundesliga.
