President Barack Obama took a break from being the real president on April Fools' Day to impersonate a fictional one, House of Cards' conniving Frank Underwood. 'Hello everybody. This is not Frank Underwood,' the president said after turning his head Underwood, who is played by Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey and frequently speaks Shakespearean-style monologues to the audience. 'This is Barack Obama. Happy April Fools' Day. Frank learned it from me,' he said. Scroll down for video. President Barack Obama impersonated House of Cards's fictional president Frank Underwood by dipping into a southern drawl. Obama attempted to copy the deep voice and South Carolina accent of the fictional Commander-in-Chief, who is known for scheming his way into the nation's highest office through deceit and violence. The real president slipped into his normal voice by the end of 12-second impersonation. He has previously admitted to watching the Netflix show, though he says that life in Washington is not as dramatic as portrayed by Kevin Spacey and others. 'I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient,' he said in 2013. The short clip in front of a portrait of Abraham Lincoln begins with a statement of the time and date, a commonly used scene entry device in House of Cards. Underwood, portrayed in the Netflix series by Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey, frequently speaks in asides to the camera as he crafts his political machinations. Obama was also asked to cameo on the show by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, according to Deadline. His April Fools' joke was filmed as part of the West Wing Week YouTube series, which chronicled the presidents' week. The clip for this week also included outtakes from the five previous years of Obama's presidency, which featured the president making funny faces and practicing speeches. On Thursday House of Cards was renewed for a fourth season.
