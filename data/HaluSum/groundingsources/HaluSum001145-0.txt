Chinese parents are passionate about raising child prodigies - whether they are 10-year-old university entrants or four-year-old Michael Jackson dance-alikes. Now a new basketball superstar is on the rise. A viral video is making the rounds in China, which shows a small boy displaying a dazzling array of basketball skills that would put to shame many professional players. The five-year-old child is called Mai Zizhuo and he has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, reported the People's Daily Online. The video starts off with the pint-sized player scoring a succession of hoops before running around dribbling two basketballs. His eyes are focused on the camera while handling two basketballs at the same time and still he didn't lose rhythm once. His incredible skills have won him legions of fans across basketball-mad China. The country's biggest basketball star so far has been Shanghai-born Yao Ming, who played for NBA's Houston Rockets from 2002 to 2011. Talented: Five-year-old Mai Zizhuo shows his outstanding basketball skills in a viral video. Skilful: The pint-sized player scored a succession of hoops before running around dribbling two basketballs. Praised: His incredible skills have won him legions of fans across China. Stunned by Mai's potential, netizens in China leave comments by the thousands. Lakers fan 'Siu720' said: 'I can't believe it……..it must be special effects!' 'NickWooster' from Fujian simply asking: 'Who is his father?' Others feel ashamed of their own basketball skills in comparison to the kid. 'Cubex' from Hunan posted: 'I want to reincarnate and start over again! What have I been doing for the past 32 years?'
