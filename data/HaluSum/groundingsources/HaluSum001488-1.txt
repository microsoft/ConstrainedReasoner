There was no special treatment for Lewis Ferguson at Paul Nicholls’s yard on Thursday morning. The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual, just a cut on the nose to show for the fall which has made him an internet sensation. Ferguson’s spectacular double somersault fall from the favourite Merrion Square in the 4.20pm at Wincanton has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online. But he was back riding out and is undeterred from getting back in the saddle. Amateur jockey Lee Lewis Ferguson has just a cut on his nose to show for his ordeal. Teenager Ferguson was flung from his horse in spectacular fashion at Wincanton. ‘It was just a blur,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t work out what had happened until I got back to the weighing room and watched the replay. All the other jockeys asked me if I was all right and stuff, they all watched with me and looked away in horror. It’s about the most impressive fall I’ve seen. ‘There was nothing I could do to avoid it, you just have to let it take its course and hope it’s not a bad one. I’ve been very lucky. I got a bit of abuse from the lads and picked up a few hundred Twitter followers but it’s all good banter. ‘Given the somersaults, maybe I’ll look at having a gymnastics career after finishing racing.’
