Alvaro Morata wants to continue his development at Juventus and has no interest in rejoining Real Madrid, according to his agent Beppe Bozzo. The 22-year-old joined the Italian giants for £15.8million last summer after failing to break into the Real first-team on a regular basis. Morata signed a five-year deal at the Juventus Stadium after starting just three games in La Liga for Real during the 20113-14 campaign. Alvaro Morata is happy at Juventus and has no interest in joining Real Madrid, according to his agent. And the Spain international has impressed since moving to Turin - having netted seven goals in 22 Serie A matches so far this season. Madrid have a buy back option on the forward but Bozzo insists Morata is keen to fulfill his five-year deal at the Juventus Stadium and develop as a player. 'The situation just now is very favourable for Juve. When it comes to important players like him, we almost always have the last word, regardless of clubs or clauses,' Bozzo told Tuttosport. 'Morata is fine at Juve, he is not thinking about anything else. It all depends on what the player wants, just as it was when he decided to leave Madrid a year ago. Morata (left) started just three La Liga games for Real last season - in a season of limited opportunities. 'Alvaro is not a hypocrite, he says what he thinks. He will not have a foot in both camps. A few days ago he said that Juve is fine and that he isn't thinking of returning to Madrid; he wants continue to grow with Juve. Even to me he has always expressed the same idea. 'No club, not even one as powerful as Real, can spend so much money to sign a player who does not want to move. 'He is already worth twice as much as Juve spent to buy him - at least €40 (£29) million.' 22-year-old (left) has scored seven goals in 22 Serie A matches so far this campaign for Juventus.
