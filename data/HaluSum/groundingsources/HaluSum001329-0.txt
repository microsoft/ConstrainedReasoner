Salford half-back Rangi Chase faces the threat of a four to eight-match ban after he was charged with making a Grade E dangerous throw on Good Friday. The Red Devils went on to beat Huddersfield 18-12 to continue their recent good form, but they could now be without their mercurial stand-off for a lengthy period. The Rugby Football League's match-review panel viewed Chase's tackle on Brett Ferres in the 15th minute of the match at the John Smith's Stadium as dangerous and he has been asked to appear before an independent disciplinary tribunal on Wednesday evening. Salford's Rangi Chase could face a ban of up to eight matches following a dangerous tackle. Chase will be joined at Red Hall by Salford team-mate Weller Hauraki, Widnes' Danny Tickle and Hull KR prop Mitch Allgood, who face Grade C, B and A charges respectively. Four other players - Widnes hooker Lloyd White, Warrington prop Anthony England, Hull KR back-rower Maurice Blair and Hull FC utility back Jordan Rankin - were also charged for offences in round eight and have until 11am on Wednesday to submit early-guilty pleas. All eight players are available to play for their clubs on Easter Monday.
