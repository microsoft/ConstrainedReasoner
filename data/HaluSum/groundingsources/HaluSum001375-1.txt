Dogs are usually maestros when it comes to games of throw and catch - especially when there's food involved. But Fritz the Golden Retriever from California appears to lack any eye-mouth co-ordination skills, as a new video shows. The pooch was filmed wearing bunny ears this Easter trying - and miserably failing - to catch a hard-boiled egg between his teeth. Slow-motion footage shows him licking his lips and enthusiastically leaping up to catch the treat. However, despite his best efforts, the egg narrowly misses his jaw, bounces off his chest and hits the grass instead. A defeated Fritz is then seen hanging his head low, with his bunny ears falling to the ground. The pup has made quite a name for himself with his poor catching skills. Indeed, his YouTube channel boasts more than five million hits. Other videos show him being thrown steak, tacos, bread rolls, pizza and donuts, with misses every time. Fritz's owner, Evan Ball, hopes that one day the dog will be able to achieve the 'paw-fect' catch. He added: 'While we all intently anticipate the day when Fritz masters the skill of catching food in his mouth, we also patiently embrace the journey.' Ready, set, go: Fritz the Golden Retriever from California appears to lack any eye-mouth co-ordination skills, as a new video shows. Good effort: The pooch was filmed wearing bunny ears this Easter trying, and miserably failing, to catch a hard-boiled egg between his teeth. Not-so-paw-fect catch: Slow-motion footage shows him licking his lips and enthusiastically leaping up to catch the treat. Defeated: However, despite his best efforts, the egg narrowly misses his jaw, bounces off his chest and hits the grass instead.
