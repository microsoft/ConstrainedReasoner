Toby Alderweireld will return to Atletico Madrid when his season-long loan finishes at Southampton, according to the Spanish club's sporting director Jose Luis Perez Caminero. The Belgian defender, 26, has impressed this season on the South Coast, and has hinted in the past that he would like to remain permanently in the Premier League, with Tottenham also believed to be admirers. But Atletico say they are counting on Aldeirwereld to return to La Liga, as well as Oliver Torres who has been plying his trade in Portugal with Porto. Toby Alderweireld will return to Atletico Madrid once his loan spell ends at Southampton. 'Our coaches follow a detailed monitoring of all the players that are loaned to other teams,' Caminero told Atletico's official website. 'We are very pleased with their performance and growth in general. Oliver [Torres] and Alderweireld, for example, are finishing a very good season with Porto and Southampton and we are counting on them for the next campaign.' Alderweireld contract expires in June 2017, and has been a key part of a defence with Southampton that has seen Ronald Koeman's side challenge for the Champions League places. Alderweireld holds his head during Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifier with Israel in Jerusalem last week.
