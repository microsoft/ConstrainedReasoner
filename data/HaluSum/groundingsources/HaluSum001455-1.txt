Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted he had to change his everyday habits as he got older to continue managing Manchester United. Ferguson enjoyed a trophy-laden 26-and-a-half years in the Old Trafford hotseat where he won 38 trophies - including 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League successes. The Scot was appointed as the Red Devils manager in November 1986 at the age of 45 before announcing his retirement at the end of the 2012-13 season aged 71. Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted he had to change his everyday habits as he got older in management. Ferguson enjoyed a trophy-laden 26-and-a-half years in the Manchester United hotseat between 1986-2013. And the now 73-year-old revealed that he had to modify his sleeping pattern to ensure he still had the same energy for the consuming role at United as he did when he first started – due to Father Time catching up with him. 'When I came to United in my early 40s everyone saw the energy but when you get older you're the only one that recognises or knows the kind of energy you've got left,' he told American satellite radio station SiriusXM on Thursday. 'And I had to realign myself when I got in to my 60s in terms of putting it in and the sleep I needed to maintain my energy until the very end because people expect to see the same enegy all the time. 'That's the problem when you're leading a group of people all the time.' Ferguson's (centre) honours include 13 Premier League titles - with his last coming in his final season in 2013.
