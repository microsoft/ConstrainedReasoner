Alessandro Diamanti and Mohamed Salah helped Fiorentina to a 2-0 win over Sampdoria on a rain-drenched pitch which lifted their team into fourth place on 49 points. Former West Ham midfielder Diamanti struck just after the hour mark, before on loan Chelsea winger Salah added a second just two minutes later. Miralem Pjanic's goal gave AS Roma a 1-0 win over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday, their first home victory for more than four months. Mohamed Salah continued his scoring streak as the on-loan Chelsea midfielder struck again. Salah turns away after scoring Fiorentina's second in their 2-0 win over Sampdoria. Roma struck in the 25th minute when Alessandro Florenzi set up Pjanic after a string of precise passes and his low shot beat keeper Mariano Andujar. Pjanic, who was also on target when Roma last won at home against Inter Milan in November, gestured towards the press box after his goal. Elsewhere on Saturday, Carlos Tevez scored a thunderous free kick to help leaders Juventus beat Empoli 2-0 to stay 14 points clear at the top. Salah embraces fellow goalscorer and team-mates Alessandro Diamanti during the Serie A win. The Argentine's fierce free kick from inside the area two minutes before the break and a Roberto Pereyra tap-in in stoppage time gave Juve their fourth win in a row. AC Milan notched their first away win in over five months when Jeremy Menez out-ran two defenders and delivered an unstoppable shot to give his side a 2-1 victory over Palermo. Milan are eighth on 41 points, six adrift of fifth-placed Napoli. Inter Milan were denied their first win in five games in a 1-1 draw with bottom club Parma, who continue to show great resolve despite players not being paid since the beginning of the season. Cesena came back from a three-goal deficit in Verona to earn a point that left them third-bottom on 22 points, four behind Atalanta who lost 2-1 at home to Torino.
