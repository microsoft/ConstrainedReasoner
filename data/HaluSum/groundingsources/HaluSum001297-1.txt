Police in Rhein Erft, Germany initially dismissed reports that a kangaroo was found hopping in a field nearby. They discovered that the call was in fact serious and later found the Australian marsupial in a field in Bruhl. It wasn't until the caller was questioned in detail and provided 'very believable' answers, that the police realised that they were telling the truth. They were shocked to find a large, Australian kangaroo 'happily' hopping through a field in the town of Bruhl, 20 kilometres south of the city centre of Cologne. They attempted to capture the beast with the help of the local fire department, to no avail reported Deutsche Welle news. Police instead began to work on finding out who the marsupial belonged to. The owners later came forward and it is believed that the animal's fencing was damaged due to severe storms. They contacted a travelling circus who had recently passed through the area but they could account for all of their kangaroos. The owners later contacted police after their kangaroo had returned to it's enclosure. It is suspected that the animal's fencing was damaged after the severe storm names 'Niklas' by GermanÂ meteorologists battered through Europe. The super storm had gusts of up to 192 kilometres per hour and was one of the most powerful storms in recent years.
