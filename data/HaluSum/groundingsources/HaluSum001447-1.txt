Super League title sponsors First Utility have announced a new format for the Player of the Month award which lets fans vote for the league's most outstanding players. Working together with League Weekly and the fans, one player will be recognised each month with the prestigious accolade via a new online process. At the end of each month, a shortlist of five players will be drawn up by the writers of League Weekly and fans will be asked to vote for their choice on the Facebook page, www.facebook.com/firstutilitysuperleague. Leeds Rhinos' Paul Aiton has been nominated for the Super League Player of the Month award. Hull Kingston Rovers' Albert Kelly has also made the shortlist for the Player of the Month award for March. As they cast their vote, each fan will be entered into a prize draw with one lucky winner getting the chance to present the Player of the Month trophy to the selected player. The two players who garner the most votes will be considered by a judging panel of representatives from First Utility and League Weekly to decide on one overall winner. The players considered for this month's award have been revealed in Monday's League Weekly: Paul Aiton (Leeds Rhinos), Danny Brough (Huddersfield Giants), Rangi Chase (Salford Red Devils), Albert Kelly (Hull Kingston Rovers) and Matt Russell (Warrington Wolves). Fans have until April 10th to register their votes for March's competition. First Utility Chief Customer Officer Ed Kamm said of the new award format, 'It's the fans that make the First Utility Super League what it is and we want to tap into their knowledge and passion to chooose the outstanding performers each month.' Warrington Wolves' Matt Russell has also been included on the shortlist for this month's award. Wigan Warriors' Matty Smith is among the choices for March's Player of the Month award.
