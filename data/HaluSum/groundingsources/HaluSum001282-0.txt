La Liga strugglers Almeria have named former Barcelona player Sergi Barjuan as their third coach of the season. The 43-year-old Barjuan replaces Juan Ignacio Martinez, who was fired on Sunday, a day after Almeria lost 4-1 at home to Levante. Almeria confirmed that if all the necessary paperwork is complete Barjuan will coach Almeria's away match at Barcelona on Wednesday.

Barjuan spent nine years at Barcelona as a defender and played in two World Cups for Spain. He coached Recreativo in Spain's second division from 2012-14. Almeria are in the relegation zone after failing to win in seven straight matches. The club fired their first manager of the season, Francisco Rodriguez, in December.
