Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are billed as two great rivals of modern day football but if former Brazil striker Ronaldo has his way, they could one day be in the same team. The 2002 World Cup winner is a co-owner of second tier United States sideÂ Fort Lauderdale Strikers and Ronaldo wants to leave no stone unturned in his quest to make the side a major global force. The ex-Barcelona and Real Madrid striker admitted his desire to see the best talent in the world at his club. Ronaldo says he 'would pay out of his own pocket' to sign Lionel Messi to his United States football team. Cristiano Ronaldo is also a target for ex-Brazil and Inter Milan striker's US team. Ronaldo is a co-owner of second tier United States team, Fort Lauderdale Strikers. 'I would pay from my own pocket to sign Messi,' Ronaldo is reported as saying in Marca. 'This club will be great. Why not Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo why not? In a few years we can achieve it. Nothing is impossible.' Ronaldo believes that football will continue to grow in popularity in the United States and that the lifestyle on offer in America appeals to the elite calibre of players. 'The US is the second country in the world after China, where football grows,' Ronaldo said. 'Many famous players want to come to play South Florida for the quality of life. Who would not want to live here?'
