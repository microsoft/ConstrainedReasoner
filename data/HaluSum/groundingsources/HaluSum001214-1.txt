If you want change let me through it at you as hard as I can at your dirty face' A member of the team who made the video said: 'We set out to give the homeless a voice and put a human face to the individuals so often get mistaken for stereotypes. 'Their reactions will remind you the conversation around the issue needs to change. All humans should work together.' In the video, we see a couple called Tristan and Robyn have been homeless for 10 years read out the message: 'I hate the homeless, I don’t feel sorry for you. If you want change let me through it at you as hard as I can at your dirty face.' A young man called Jesse, who has been homeless for three years, said: 'I hate when it gets cold out because then all of the homeless people get on the bus.' Paul  reads out the tweet: 'I hate seeing homeless people standing in the cold shivering. Be glad when the light turns green' Several of the men and women, who all live in Toronto, break down in tears as they read the hurtful comments. Peter has been homeless for eight year and wells up as he reads out the tweet: 'I wonder if homeless people go to heaven.' Cheryl, who has been without a home for seven years cries as she reads: 'If home is where the heart is then are homeless people heartless? In a separate video, the men and women respond to common misconceptions about people who sleep on the streets. Peter  reads out the tweet: 'I wonder if homeless people go to heaven' Kim, who has been homeless for three years, cries after reading out the message: 'Never understand why homeless people smell of p**s when you can literally p**s anywhere.' Melissa, who has been homeless for 10 years, ended up homeless because she endured an abusive childhood that saw her put into care. She said: 'My biological mother was very problematic she was abusive towards my siblings and I, she set the house on fire and left my sisters and I in the house. 'We were returned to her care and then she wasn’t taking proper care of her us I was taken back into care. 'I ended up in a group home in Toronto where I ran away when I was 17 and I [have been] on my own since.' She reads out the message: 'I was enjoying a latte when I saw a hobo girl across the street. I almost vomited. 'Get back on your side of the bridge, no one likes you.' She responds by saying: 'I’ve read numerous tweets about how foul homeless people are and I want you to know that not all of us have a choice.' Melissa reads out the message: 'I was enjoying a latte when I saw a hobo girl across the street. I almost vomited.'Get back on your side of the bridge, no one likes you' Cheryl breaks down as she reads: 'If home is where the heart is then are homeless people heartless?' Another man called Kim ended up homeless after struggling to cope with the deaths of both his partner and his parents. He said: 'How my journey to homeless really began was through the death of my partner. 'Then dealing with my mother and father’s death kept compounding the grief until it became so heavy that it crushed me. 'There was nothing of any value left. I couldn’t pay the rent and got evicted. I took what clothes I could and I donated all of his clothes to a shelter. 'I took all of the suitcases I had and locked them in the bus terminal lockers and went and sat in City Hall at the fountain and that’s when I spent my first night there.' He cries after reading out the tweet: 'Never understand why homeless people smell of p**s when you can literally p**s anywhere.' Kubby reads out the message: 'Maybe if homeless people took care of themselves and looked pretty we would want to help them but I don’t help yellow teeth' Jesse reads out the tweet: 'I hate when it gets cold out because then all of the homeless people get on the bus' While all of the people in the video have been homeless for a considerable amount of time, a man called Kubby has spent the most amount of time sleeping rough - 47 years. He addresses the allegation that most people who are homeless are alcoholics or drug addicts, telling the cameras: 'People state that if you’re homeless you’re an alcoholic or drug user. 'I was drinking before I was born because my mum was an alcoholic and she drank during the pregnancy, it created health problems for myself and an infant and growing up. 'We’re not all bad people, we’ve got feelings, we’re caring, we have friendships, just give us a chance.' Jesse backs the wish for people to see through the fact that they are homeless and to recognise that they are human beings, just like everyone else. He said: 'Let’s stand together as people, why do we have to always begrudge other people just because of the way they look, the way they sound, the way they smell. 'That is still a person, they’re still drawing breath and they still have a heartbeat, they still love and have sadness, they’re still people.'
