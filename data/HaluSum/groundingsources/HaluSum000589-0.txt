Love it or hate it, Jared Leto's interpretation of the Joker is an internet sensation. The Oscar winner put on white makeup (and a lot of tattoos this time) to portray the Clown Prince of Crime in the upcoming movie "Suicide Squad." Set for release August 5, 2016, "Suicide Squad" is based on the DC Comics series and also stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis. Twitter users got their first look at Leto in character Friday night, and the memes started almost immediately. From comparisons to "Home Alone" to an imagining of Ben Affleck tatted up, people on social media put their Photoshopping skills to work all weekend. Which is your favorite?
