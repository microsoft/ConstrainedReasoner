Helsinborg manager Henrik Larsson was forced to play his 42-year-old kit man in goal on Saturday. The former Celtic and Barcelona striker had no option but to play Daniel Andersson  with goalkeepers Par Hansson and Matt Pyzdrowski out injured. Astonishingly, the emergency stopper kept a clean sheet as Helsinborg drew 0-0 against Kalmar in the Allsvenskan season opener. Helsinborg manager Henrik Larsson was forced to play 42-year-old kit man Daniel Andersson in goal. Speaking to local TV after the game, Andersson - a retired goalkeeper who earned one cap for Sweden in 2001 - said: 'It was a scenario that I never could have prepared myself for. Going from kit man, to goalie coach, to playing. 'I am a goalie coach first and foremost. But now I have set the standard.' Larsson added: 'You have to be impressed. He [Andersson] is almost 43 and didn’t make a mistake in this game. I’m very happy to have Daniel Andersson multi-tasking for our club.' Andersson made 130 appearances for the club between 2004 and 2009 and also spent a season with Scottish club Hibernian during a 22-year playing career. Larsson, pictured in 2013, was impressed with Andersson's display during Helsinborg's 0-0 draw with Kalmar.
