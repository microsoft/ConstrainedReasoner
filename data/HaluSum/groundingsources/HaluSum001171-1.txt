Get ready to dig deep - the impulse to buy a treat peaks today at 12.52pm. A study claims that Britons spend an average of £62 a week on rewarding themselves, with retail therapy reaching a high at lunchtime today. Treats can range from as little as a bar of chocolate or a glass of wine to designer clothes and shoes, according to research by website VoucherCodes.co.uk. A study reveals that Britons spend an average of £62 a week on rewarding themselves, with retail therapy reaching a high at lunchtime today. Treats can range from a bar of chocolate to a glass of wine. And surprisingly, men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves. They are also more likely to lie about their expenditure and hide items they have purchased from their partners in a desperate quest to keep their shopping habits under wraps, a different survey last year found. The shoppers of Swansea are the most frivolous, with 44 per cent splurging as soon as they are paid, followed by those in Aberdeen (42 per cent) and Belfast (39 per cent). The most cautious spenders live in Wolverhampton, where only 19 per cent choose to treat themselves on pay day. Designer items (stock image above) are also popular buys and men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves, the research claims. Other research claimed the average Brit spends £153 within 24 hours of payday - while 10 per cent splurge more than £500. Some workers said they spend so much in the 24 hours after payday because they had arranged their regular payments and direct debits to leave their accounts around that time. While others said it was because they felt like they deserved the treat.
