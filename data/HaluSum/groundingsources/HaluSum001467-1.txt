After Manchester United eased past Aston Villa to make it five Premier League wins on the bounce, Juan Mata admitted his side still have work to do and must take every game as a 'final.' The Spaniard has found his best form at a crucial part of the season, with a place in the Champions League all but sealed and an opportunity to finish second a real possibility. United are currently above rivals Manchester City by one point and looking for a top two finish - where they can qualify automatically for the group stages - but Mata knows his side can't afford to slip-up in the final seven games.

'The season has gone so quickly â€“ it seems we were in pre-season only a few months ago. But we still have some finals left before the end,' he told MUTV. 'We want to finish as high as we can and I think we can win a lot of games between now and the end of the season if we perform like we did in the last few games. 'We are facing two or three very big rivals like Chelsea, City and Arsenal so we need to be at our best level to beat them. Each game is a final and we have to think about each one on their own. 'So now we are thinking about Sunday [against City] and then we will think about the next one. Every point is very important from now until the end and we will look at every game as a final.' Mata celebrates with Ander Herrera after his second goal finished off Aston Villa at Old Trafford.
