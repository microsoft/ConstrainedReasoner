This is the surreal moment a dog takes the reins and literally drags his owner out for a walk. Dashcam footage, shared by dailymotion.com user Vidsking, shows a giant St. Bernard  running across a road somewhere in the Czech Republic with a child trailing behind. It appears to be a rather uncomfortable excursion, with the young boy going along the ground on his belly with his legs stretched out behind. As the canine scampers along, his passenger holds tightly to a leash. Two men watching the bizarre scene from their car are heard chuckling in the background. They're forced to slow down  to avoid hitting the animal and human train. Once the dog reaches the other side of the road, it makes its way over a muddy verge. At that point the boy gets up and stumbles forwards. Another pedestrian is seen on the roadside but he doesn't appear to be overly fazed by the scene. According to the video time stamp, the incident took place on March 3 just past 5pm. 'A dog walks a child,' the cameraman casually titled the unusual piece of footage.
