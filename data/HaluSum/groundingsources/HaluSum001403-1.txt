World all-around silver medallist and reigning pommel horse champion Max Whitlock and Olympic team-mates Kristian Thomas, Sam Oldham and Daniel Purvis are also selected, with Courtney Tulloch finishing off the six-man squad. Louis Smith will represent Great Britain for first time since winning two medals at London 2012. British gymnast Smith won a silver and bronze medal during the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Four-time Commonwealth Games champion Claudia Fragapane is in the women's team, which also includes the experienced Becky Downie and her younger sister Ellie and 2015 British all-around champion Amy Tinkler. The European championships take place in Montpellier between April 15 and 19 and will only feature individual all-around and apparatus events. Smith is currently dating former The Only Way is Essex star Lucy Mecklenburgh.
