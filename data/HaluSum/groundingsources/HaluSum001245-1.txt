Edinburgh welcome back three Scotland internationals for Sunday's European Challenge Cup quarter-final with London Irish. Dougie Fife, Alasdair Dickinson and Ross Ford were all rested for last week's Guinness Pro12 26-15 win over Scarlets in Llanelli following their efforts for the Dark Blues during the RBS Six Nations. But the trio have been recalled by head coach Alan Solomons for the Madejski Stadium clash with the Exiles as the South African looks to name is strongest XV. Dougie Fife is one of a trio of Scottish players returning to Edinburgh following Six Nations duty. England's Courtney Lawes (left) is tackled by Scotland's Ross Ford (centre) and David Denton. He said: 'When one gets to the play-off stage of a competition each game is a one-off. We are well aware of that and know that we will need to be at our best on Sunday.' Fife returns to the right wing while the rest of the backline remains in place following last Saturday's victory in Wales. Jack Cuthbert starts at full-back, with Tim Visser on the left wing. The centre pairing of Andries Strauss and Phil Burleigh is retained, while scrum half Sam Hidlago-Clyne - the competition's top scorer with 53 points - and stand-off Greig Tonks continue their half-back combo. Edinburgh coach Alan Solomons has named his strongest XV heading into the key clash with London Irish. In the pack, prop Dickinson and hooker Ford reclaim their places, with Willem Nel remaining at tighthead. Anton Bresler and Ben Toolis start in the second row lock. Captain Mike Coman misses out after sustaining a head knock against Scarlets, so Roddy Grant moves up from the bench to start as blindside flanker. Hamish Watson and David Denton retain their places at openside and number eight respectively, leaving Ford to skipper the side.
