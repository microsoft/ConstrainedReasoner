You can call him... Joker. We've seen a few teases so far, but on Friday night, director David Ayer gave us the first full look at Jared Leto as the Joker. The Clown Prince of Crime will appear in 2016's "Suicide Squad," the first movie featuring the best-known comic book villain, where (as far as we know anyway), there is no Batman present. The Oscar winner cut his hair and shaved his face for the role, and appears to have embraced it fully. He will be the first actor to play the character on the big screen since the late Heath Ledger. "Suicide Squad" also stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie and a large cast of villains and anti-heroes. (Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Entertainment -- makers of "Suicide Squad" -- are owned by Time Warner, as is CNN.) The movie hits theaters August 5, 2016.
