Arsene Wenger has yet to decide whether to offer Abou Diaby a new contract but has hinted that the injury-prone midfielder could have a future at Arsenal beyond this summer. Diaby made his latest comeback from injury in a practice game on Wednesday but has made just 22 appearances in the last five seasons at the Emirates Stadium with extended spells on the sidelines. Arsenal face Liverpool in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off and while Wenger is unlikely to throw Diaby straight into a vital game in both clubs' seasons, he did suggest the French midfielder could earn a new deal, potentially on a pay-as-you-play deal. Arsene Wenger has yet to decide whether to offer Abou Diaby a new contract despite his injury troubles. Diaby made his latest comeback from injury in a practice game on Wednesday and could have a future. Wenger said he has made it clear how he envisages the future for Diaby at the north London club. Diaby has featured just once this season, playing for 67 minutes in the Capital One Cup defeat by Southampton in September but could get his chance in the Barclays Premier League run-in. 'I had a chat with him (Diaby) and told him how I can envisage the future,' Wenger said. 'He has to make a decision. 'Of course he understands completely that he has to perform and to show that he can be present on a consistent way. I will see where we go from there. Diaby has suffered 42 injuries during his Arsenal career, keeping him out of action for a total of 226 weeks. Wenger also hopes to find a positive solution to tie Tomas Rosicky down to a contract extension at Arsenal. Club captain Mikel Arteta (right) has also been out with injury and is another to secure to a contract extension. 'I wouldn't like to go into details, we have to meet again to see where we go from what I told him. It has to be linked a little bit with his presence.' Wenger also indicated he hoped to secure contract extensions for club captain Mikel Arteta and long-serving midfielder Tomas Rosicky. 2014. Calf Muscle Strain, November 24. Calf/Shin, October 14.
