Carlisle United manager Keith Curle has launched a scathing attack on his side following their limp 3-1 defeat away at Accrington Stanley, even suggesting that some players 'don't deserve to be professionals.' The Cumbrians are without a win in five games in League Two and are just two places and three points in the table above the relegation zone. 'The strength of character in that changing room is alarmingly week,' Curle said to BBC Radio Cumbria after the match at the Crown Ground. Carlisle United boss Keith Curle has laid into his players following their dismal 3-1 loss at Accrington Stanley. He added, 'You've got to be accountable for yourself and have pride, there are players who can't say they care they put in a performance. They are players who don't deserve to be professionals' Carlisle were relegated from League One last season and have just five games left this term to avoid a similar fate. But Curle was demonstrably cynical as to their chances. 'There's no spirit in this changing room,' he said. The 51-year-old also revealed he was considering staging an open forum for the club's supporters. 'I might get 50 supporters to come down, have an open forum and through (club chairman) Andrew Jenkins they can have half an hour with the players. 'They can tell them exactly what they think of them, and they'll have to take it. Supporters can see when people aren't giving everything for the shirt.'
