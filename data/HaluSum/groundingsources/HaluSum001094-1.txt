Scotland will discover on May 21 if September's Euro 2016 qualifier with Georgia will be played behind closed doors. UEFA has announced it has opened disciplinary proceedings against the Georgian Football Federation (GFF) after fans twice invaded the field of play during Sunday's 2-0 defeat by Germany in Tbilisi. European football's governing body is also set to look at charges that allege home fans were guilty of setting off fireworks while a string of safety breaches, including blocked stairs, locked gates and a lack of body searches by staff at the Boris Paichadze Stadium, will also be investigated. A fan invades the pitch during Georgia's 2-0 defeat by Germany on Sunday in Tbilisi. Play was halted twice at the Boris Paichadze Stadium due to Georgia fans arriving onto the field. UEFA's Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will decide the case on May 21. The GFF has already vowed to tighten up security in the wake of those crowd disturbances. But GFF president Zviad Sichinava admits he fears UEFA will force him to shut the stadium for the September 4 meeting with Gordon Strachan's side, throwing Scottish supporters' travel plans into chaos. UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against the Georgian Football Federation over the incidents. He said: 'Delegates from UEFA are already sending reports and unfortunately there will be monetary sanctions. 'Also the next Georgia home game - against Scotland - could be held without spectators.' Scotland currently sit third in Group D, a point behind leaders Poland. Georgia are fifth, with just one win from five games.
