Yaya Toure was accused by Jamie Carragher of ducking out of the way of Jason Puncheon's free-kick which killed off Manchester City's hopes of salvaging something from Selhurst Park. Toure, who is paid £200,000-a-week, was part of a five-man wall when Puncheon stepped up to double Crystal Palace's lead, but Sportsmail columnist Carragher feels the City midfielder did not do enough to prevent the winner. 'That's not acceptable when you go into a wall,' Carragher said on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football. 'The rest of them are desperate to be hit with the ball in the face and it's poor from Yaya Toure. Jason Puncheon takes the free-kick that killed off Manchester City's chances at Selhurst Park on Monday. Yaya Toure was accused by Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher of ducking out of the way of Puncheon's free-kick. Fernandinho and Vincent Kompany look keen to get their head to the ball but Toure appears to duck. How the top of the Premier League table looks. 'It's a huge wall. Sometimes you look at walls, and that is one of the biggest you'll ever see. 'As he [Puncheon] connects with the ball, if you look at the knees, they're all crouching ready to jump. Yaya Toure doesn't look in the same position as the rest to start with. 'The only thing I was thinking was, does he think it is going to hit him in the face? He puts his head down to try to head it away. 'The more I look at it, everybody else is looking at the ball, doing everything they can. It's not in [Vincent] Kompany's line. It's not in Fernandinho's line. They're stretching their necks trying to get something on it. That's just damning for Yaya Toure.' The defeat left champions City nine points adrift of Chelsea, who also have a game in hand. Carragher accused Toure of shying away from his duties in the wall during the Premier League defeat.
