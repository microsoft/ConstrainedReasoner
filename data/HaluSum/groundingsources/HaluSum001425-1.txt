Wales' crunch Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out. The top two sides in Group B meet at the Cardiff City Stadium on June 12 with Wales in their best position to qualify for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden. Belgium and Wales both have 11 points from five games with Marc Wilmots' side - ranked fourth in the world - on top spot because of a superior goal difference. Wales'  Euro 2016 qualifier with Belgium this summer has been declared a 33,000 sell-out. Gareth Bale fires homes a brilliant free-kick during Wales' 3-0 victory over Israel in Euro 2016 qualifying. Real Madrid star Bale celebrates as the victory took Wales to the top of the Group B table on goal difference. But Wales' comprehensive 3-0 victory in Israel last weekend has seen expectations rise that Chris Coleman's charges can claim one of the two automatic qualifying spots and make it all the way to the 2016 finals in France. 'The stunning performance in Israel has created a huge buzz around Chris Coleman's team and the FAW has been inundated with orders for tickets,' the Football Association of Wales said in a statement on its website. 'Due to overwhelming demand, general admission tickets for the European qualifiers match between Wales and Belgium at the Cardiff City Stadium have now sold out.' It is understood the Wales squad prefer to play at the Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium. There had been speculation that Wales would play Belgium at the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium with so much interest in the match. But that was never going to happen as UEFA rules prevent the venue being changed within 120 days of the scheduled date. It is understood Gareth Bale and company would prefer playing at the more intimate Cardiff City Stadium rather than the Millennium Stadium, where they have not played since meeting England in a Euro 2012 qualifier in March 2011.
