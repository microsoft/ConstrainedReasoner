This isn't the first time a celebrity has snapped a selfie with an unsuspecting fan. In January, former Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Halladay tweeted a photo to his more than 40,000 Twitter followers of himself in front of a fan who wore a red shirt with the former player's name and jersey number on the back. This guy wasn't so lucky. Apparently, Halladay didn't meet the fan, he tweeted: 'Oopps you missed me! Walked right by me! Hope he gets to see his pic with me on Twitter, he doesn't know we took this.'

'Full House' star John Stamos, who played Uncle Jessie, stopped by his TV home in San Francisco last month and went unnoticed by fans checking out the famous house. The 51-year-old actor took a photo of himself in front of the home as the unsuspecting fans marveled at the front of the San Francisco house featured in the opening sequence of the family sitcom. Stamos uploaded the photo to Instagram with the caption: 'Boy, these youngsters have 0.0 idea what they're missing. #Fullhousehouse. #TURNAROUND.' It is unknown if the 'youngsters' ever did, in fact, #TURNAROUND or if they missed their 'old familiar friend.' #TURNAROUND:Â Last month, 'Full House' star John Stamos (left), who played Uncle Jessie, stopped by his TV home in San Francisco last month and went unnoticed by fans checking out the famous house.
