Brian O'Driscoll won't be thanking whoever snapped him crowd surfing at a party in Hong Kong any time soon after the picture went viral. To make matters worse the Irish rugby legend's wife Amy Huberman caught wind of the picture on social media, with hilarious consequences. O'Driscoll has been in Hong Kong this week working as an ambassador for HSBC ahead of the Hong Kong Sevens and clearly found time to unwind away from his commitments. Amy Huberman shares a joke with her husband in the Royal Box at Wimbledon last summer. The couple are pictured attending a Downing Street reception following the victorious 2013 Lions tour. On Monday, at home in Ireland, actress Huberman posted the picture of O'Driscoll and wrote: 'You know when your husband is away in Hong Kong on a very important business trip...' This was followed by a that read: 'I better get a giant Toblerone from the duty free.' Sure enough, O'Driscoll returned on Tuesday, tail between his legs with the requested Toblerone. Clearly taking some joy in her husband's embarrassment, Huberman later posted a picture of O'Driscoll holding the chocolate bar, declaring: 'He's home.' O'Driscoll may think twice before crowd surfing in future. The couple celebrates Ireland's Six Nations success in O'Driscoll's final international match in March 2014.
