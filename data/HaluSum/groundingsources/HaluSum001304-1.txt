No Tiger Woods and no Rory McIlroy in the field is proving no problem in Houston, where record numbers have descended on the small suburb of Humble for the Shell Houston Open. The last tournament before the Masters is proving quite a show-stopper itself thanks to the crowd-pleasing antics of the popular Phil Mickelson and local boy Jordan Spieth. It’s 18 months now since Spieth attracted criticism for giving up on university and joining the PGA Tour as the 809th ranked player in the world. Spieth, only 21, has since risen to number four in the world. Funnily enough, no-one’s criticising him anymore. Spectators have flocked to see Texas local boy Jordan Spieth in action at the Shell Houston Open. Spieth's fellow American Phil Mickelson has also impressed in the run up to the Masters. In seven starts this season Spieth, who finished runner-up on his Masters debut last year, has finished outside the top seven only twice, and here a second-round 66 lifted him to within three shots of the leader, Andrew Putnam. As for Mickelson, he’d hardly played a decent shot this year before posting rounds of 66 and 67 to be one stroke behind at halfway. The stage was set beautifully, therefore, for the two Americans at opposite ends of their careers. Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey were also going well at five shots off the pace.
