The two biggest names at the Masters this week have gone to the same Augusta club member to help them realise their dreams. Rory McIlroy believes Jeff Knox , a former Georgia State mid-amateur champion, reads the mysterious Augusta putting surfaces better than anyone he has ever seen. And on Friday Knox completed something of a notable double when he answered the call from Tiger Woods to play a practice round.

Knox played as a non-competing marker with McIlroy when the Northern Irishman was first man out in the third round last year. He even outscored the world No 1 by a shot, with a 70 to McIlroy’s 71. A fortnight later, McIlroy wrote him a letter asking if he might be able to call upon his advice in the future. ‘Playing with Jeff, it was a treat for me to see how he played the golf course,’ said McIlroy, following his round last year. ‘The fact he wrote at all says an awful lot about Rory and it was quite an honour for him to say what he did,’ said Knox. ‘I’d gladly help him out. I just happened to play good that day. I guess that helped.’ McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta.
