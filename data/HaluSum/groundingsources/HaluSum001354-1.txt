Police are hunting for three suspects who brazenly stole an ATM from a California gas station last Friday morning. CCTV footage shows the thieves in action at the Shell fuel stop along Ygnacio Valley Road in Walnut Creek. While one man distracts a cashier at the window, another leads a cable from the back of a white pickup to the cash machine. Once the cord is attached, the vehicle in the background speeds off and uproots the ATM from its mount. Sparks are caught flying into the air as the large device is dragged across the tarmac. The man who was previously  talking to the gas station clerk then runs towards the truck. He is seen wearing a bright red beanie, black pants, sweat top and sneakers. Although it is dark, he appears to load the ATM into the pickup before making a swift getaway with his crew.
