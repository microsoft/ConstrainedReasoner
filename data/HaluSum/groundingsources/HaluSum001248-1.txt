Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew insists Manchester City can come from behind again to snatch the Barclays Premier League title from Chelsea. City overtook Liverpool with one match to go before being crowned champions last season and in 2012, Sergio Aguero's injury-time strike in the final game sank Manchester United on goal difference. Chelsea are currently six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand but Pardew, whose Palace side host City on Monday, believes the race is far from over. Alan Pardew cups his ears during a clash between Crystal Palace against Stoke and the Eagles boss has refused to rule Manchester City out of the title race. Manchester City won the Premier League title last season after going top with one game to play. Sergio Aguero's dramatic injury time winner against QPR in 2012 sealed City's first Premier League title win. 'Of course they are still in the title race, it's been proven many times the race is never over,' Pardew said. 'Even when City won it, it went to the last seconds. 'It's the great thing about the Premier League, you can't take victories for granted.' Pardew has no fresh injury concerns ahead of the match against City. Marouane Chamakh, Fraizer Campbell (both hamstring) and Jordon Mutch (thigh) are still out while captain Mile Jedinak is suspended.
