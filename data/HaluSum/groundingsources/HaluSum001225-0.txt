The BBC has come under fire for spending thousands of pounds of licence fee payers' money on a guide teaching its staff the correct way to use emojis. The 44-page document was commissioned by executives at the BBC who then hired an agency to research how smiley faces could be used in news stories and on social media. Emoji designers were also told to make graphics for the faces of popular stars such as Gary Lineker and Graham Norton.

Dia Chakravarty from the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This would be a fitting April Fool's joke - if we weren't paying for it.' A BBC spokesman said: 'We carry out research to help give our audiences what they want and it's right that we do it.'
