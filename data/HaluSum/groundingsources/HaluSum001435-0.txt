Richard Henyekane, a former South Africa striker, was killed in a car crash early Tuesday, his club and the country's Premier Soccer League have confirmed. Henyekane's club, Free State Stars, said the 31-year-old player was traveling with four other people in the vehicle but was the only person to die in the crash. Henyekane made nine appearances for South Africa in 2009. He was on loan at Free State Stars from Pretoria-based Mamelodi Sundowns. Henyekane went on as a substitute in Stars' 1-0 loss to AmaZulu in the east coast city of Durban in the PSL on Saturday. Richard Henyekane died tragically in a car accident on Tuesday morning while he driving in Bethlehem. South African media reported the crash happened in Bethlehem, the town in central South Africa where Free State Stars are based. Other South African clubs, South African Football Association President Danny Jordaan, and the minister of sport sent messages of condolence for Henyekane. Henyekane's younger brother, Joseph, who was also a footballer, died in December. South Africa has a poor road safety record. Runner and former 800-meter world champion Mbulaeni Mulaudzi died in a road accident late last year. The forward made nine appearances for South Africa in 2009 and played for Free State Stars this season.
