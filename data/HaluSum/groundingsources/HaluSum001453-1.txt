A dog left in critical condition after being repeatedly stabbed in a violent attack, is on the road to recovery. The sandy-colored canine was found sprawled in a pool of his own blood on a rural road in Cass County, North Dakota. The animal, who has been named Wilford by his rescuers, needed more than 50 stitches after being set upon with an eight inch blade. Wilford has been nursed back to health by a foster family and is now slowly returning to his paws. Survivor: Wilford is on the road to recovery after being found stabbed in Cass County, North Dakota. He doesn't seem traumatized,' foster mother Ellen Brisch, from 4 Luv Of Dog Rescue, reportedly told Valley News Live. 'He loves people and he's very happy with us.' In the days after the attack Ellen, from the non profit organisation, focused on making sure Wilford got lots of rest and took his medication. Two weeks on, she told how she is now noticing the spring return to the dog's step. 'Giving them another chance is really important,' Brisch told the website.
