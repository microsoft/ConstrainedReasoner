HaluSum000110-1	0	President Obama's administration has made too many concessions in the nuclear deal with Iran, ignoring the fact that tough sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress were the reason why Iran came to the negotiating table in the first place. The deal on the table will allow Iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure and receive billions of dollars in sanction relief, giving Tehran an easy exit while President Obama gives up enormous leverage. The deal also lacks tough safeguards to stop Iran from cheating, and the inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency will not be allowed to inspect military sites without warning, putting the world at risk of Iran developing nuclear weapons. Given Iran's past behavior, the best predictor of its future behavior is not good, and the framework before us could potentially open even more doors for Iran to become a nuclear weapon state.	1

HaluSum000706-1	0	"Hungarian architect Matyas Gutai has completely redefined how houses can be built by incorporating water into his designs. His prototype house, built in Kecskemet, showcases the ""liquid engineering"" concepts he has been researching for years. Panels within the structure trap a sheet of water and promote a whole new idea of engineering, which uses a monitoring system similar to central heating. It offers a sustainable solution because it can produce its own clean energy and make structures less reliant on energy suppliers. Although slightly more expensive than typical architecture, Gutai's water panel can heat and cool the building itself. By using water as a source of warmth, it saves energy while keeping the indoor temperature toasty during winter months."	1

"	0
HaluSum000994-1	0	"Indiana's religious freedom law is causing widespread outrage as it is believed it will be used to discriminate against the LGBT community. The law expands the reach of the religious protections to private companies and cases where the government is not involved. While it is a copy of the federal law that's already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states, Sen. Chuck Schumer argued that the Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom. Although those who try to defend their discriminatory actions using the defense of religious freedom tend to lose, the Indiana law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves thus making it more ambiguous.  Because there is no nondiscrimination law that protects the LGBT community, Indiana law may be used to deny services to this community on the grounds of religious beliefs. That's why it is suggested that a ""fix"" for the Indiana law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law, or at the very least, an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination."	1
