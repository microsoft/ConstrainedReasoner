The Volkswagen Golf Estate, also known as the Volkswagen Golf Sportswagen in the United States, and the Volkswagen Golf Variant in other countries, is the estate/station wagon version of the Volkswagen Golf Mk3, Mk4, Mk5 and Mk6, first introduced in 1993. Launched in October 1997, it was the best selling car in Europe in 2001 (though it slipped to second place, behind the Peugeot 206, in 2002).
