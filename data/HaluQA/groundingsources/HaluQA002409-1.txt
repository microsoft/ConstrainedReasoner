United States Coast Guard Station Chatham is a United States Coast Guard station located in Chatham, Massachusetts. The station was the origin of the famous 1952 Pendleton rescue.SS "Pendleton" was a Type T2-SE-A1 tanker built in 1944 in Portland, Oregon, United States, for the War Shipping Administration. She was sold in 1948 to National Bulk Carriers, serving until February 1952 when she broke in two in a storm. The ship's sinking and crew rescue (along with break-up and rescue of its sister ship the "SS Fort Mercer") is the topic of the 2009 book "The Finest Hours: The True Story Behind the US Coast Guard's Most Daring Rescue", by Michael J. Tougias. Tougias' book inspired the 2016 film "The Finest Hours" with Chris Pine, which focuses on the "Pendelton" rescue.
