The Main Line of Public Works was a package of legislation supporting a vision passed in 1826 â€” a collection of various long proposed canal and road projects that became a canal system (1824 proposals and studies) and later added railroads (amendments in 1828) designed to cross the breadth of Pennsylvania (mainly, southern) with the visionary goal of providing the best commercial means of transportation between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.The Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (also known as Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel or SRDWSC) is a canal from the Port of Sacramento in West Sacramento, California to the Sacramento River, which flows into San Francisco Bay.
