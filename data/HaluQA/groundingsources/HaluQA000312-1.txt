The 2010 MTV Video Music Awards took place on September 12, 2010 at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, honoring the best music videos from the previous year. Chelsea Handler hosted the event, the first woman in sixteen years – since the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards – to do so. She hosted the late-night talk show "Chelsea Lately" on the E! network from 2007 to 2014, and released a documentary series, "Chelsea Does", on Netflix in January 2016.
