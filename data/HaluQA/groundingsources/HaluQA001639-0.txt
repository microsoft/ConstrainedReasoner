Who Put The Bomp was a rock music fanzine edited and published by Greg Shaw from 1970 to 1979. Its name came from the hit 1961 doo-wop song by Barry Mann, "Who Put the Bomp". It covers news, politics, social issues, and includes celebrity interviews and stories on entertainment, pop culture, style, travel, and a website that hosts an internet forum focusing on lesbian issues, active since 2000.
