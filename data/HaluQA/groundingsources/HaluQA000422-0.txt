 "The Twentieth Century is Almost Over" was re-recorded five years later by Cash and Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson, collectively known as The Highwaymen, on their first album entitled "Highwayman", though it was, in essence, a duet with Nelson. The critical success of the album "Shotgun Willie" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of "Red Headed Stranger" (1975) and "Stardust" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music.
