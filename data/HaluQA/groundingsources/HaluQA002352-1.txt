 After earlier large-scale collapses including the 1977 Granville Train Disaster, 1989 Newcastle earthquake and 1997 Thredbo landslide, Fire & Rescue NSW was legislated as the combat authority for responding to major structural collapse incidents within the state of New South Wales. It is the worst rail disaster in Australian history: 84 people died, more than 210 were injured, and 1,300 were affected.
