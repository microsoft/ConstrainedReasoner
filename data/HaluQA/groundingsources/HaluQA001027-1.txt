The Roxx Regime Demos is the eleventh release and third compilation album by Stryper consisting of songs originally released under the band's previous name, Roxx Regime, except for the track "Honestly", which is taken from a later demo. In 2004, Gaines left the band and was replaced by Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar) but rejoined in 2009, only to be fired after tension between the band, Gaines and his new wife.
