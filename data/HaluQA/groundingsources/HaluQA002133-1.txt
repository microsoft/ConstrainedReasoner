The Alberta Stock Exchange (ASE) was a stock exchange based in Calgary, Alberta established in 1913. The ASE was the original listing exchange for Bre-X, one of the biggest corporate frauds in Canadian history. Bre-X bought the Busang site in March 1993 and in October 1995 announced significant amounts of gold had been discovered, sending its stock price soaring. Originally a penny stock, its stock price reached a peak at CAD $286.50 (split adjusted) in May 1996 on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), with a total capitalization of over CAD $6 billion.
