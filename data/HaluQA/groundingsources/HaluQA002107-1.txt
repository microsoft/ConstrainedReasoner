 He played Flash Thompson in Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" trilogy and had various recurring roles in television on "ER", "How I Met Your Mother", and "One Tree Hill", before landing his breakout role as werewolf Alcide Herveaux on the HBO television series "True Blood". He is a star high school football player who mercilessly bullies his high school classmate Peter Parker but greatly admires Spider-Man, an irony in which the superhero takes some gratification, though he and Peter become close friends in college.
