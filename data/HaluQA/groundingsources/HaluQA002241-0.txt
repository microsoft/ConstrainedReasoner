Don Chafin (June 26, 1887 â€“ August 9, 1954) was the sheriff of Logan County, West Virginia and a commander in the Battle of Blair Mountain. For five days in late August and early September 1921, in Logan County, West Virginia, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers, called the Logan Defenders, who were backed by coal mine operators during an attempt by the miners to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields.
