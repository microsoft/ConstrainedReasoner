 In September 2004, massive rains from the remnants of Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan caused the Swannanoa to flood, causing major damage to the Biltmore Village section of Asheville, and to the other communities that it flows through. Ivan formed in early September, and reached Category 5 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
