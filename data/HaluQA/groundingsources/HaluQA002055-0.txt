El sombrero de tres picos ("The Three-Cornered Hat" or "Le tricorne") is a ballet choreographed by Léonide Massine to music by Manuel de Falla, commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev and premiered complete in 1919. He created some of his most famous roles in his own comic works, among them the Can-Can Dancer in "La Boutique fantasque" (1919), the Hussar in "Le Beau Danube" (1924), and, perhaps best known of all, the Peruvian in "Gaîté Parisienne" (1938).
