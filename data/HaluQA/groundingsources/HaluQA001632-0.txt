 After half a season of rumors and speculation, the Nuggets granted Carmelo Anthony his wish by trading him to the New York Knicks on February 21 as part of a three-team trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. The blockbuster trade also sent Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Renaldo Balkman, Shelden Williams and Corey Brewer to the Knicks for Wilson Chandler, Danilo Gallinari, Raymond Felton, Timofey Mozgov, Kosta Koufos, New York's first round pick in the 2014 draft and Golden State's second round picks in 2012 and 2013. Felton was drafted fifth overall in the 2005 NBA draft. Over his career, Felton has been a member of the Charlotte Bobcats, New York Knicks (twice), Denver Nuggets, Portland Trail Blazers, Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Clippers.
