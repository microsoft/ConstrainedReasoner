 Since 2013, Wenger Swiss Army knives are integrated in the Victorinox collection (as the "Del√©mont collection"); the brand Wenger remains for watches and licensed products. The term "Swiss Army knife" was coined by American soldiers after World War II due to the difficulty they had in pronouncing "Offiziersmesser", the German name.
