The Threepenny Opera (Die Dreigroschenoper ) is a "play with music" by Bertolt Brecht and Elisabeth Hauptmann, adapted from John Gay's 18th-century English ballad opera, "The Beggar's Opera", with music by Kurt Weill and insertion ballads by Fran√ßois Villon and Rudyard Kipling. Although Hauptmann produced 80 to 90 percent of the text, Brecht suppressed this and assumed sole credit, and is usually listed as sole author in printed versions.Macbeth (] ) is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi, with an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave and additions by Andrea Maffei, based on William Shakespeare's play of the same name.
