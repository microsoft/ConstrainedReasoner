The Public Land Commission, a former agency of the United States government, was created following the admission of California as a state in 1850 (part of the Compromise of 1850). The compromise, drafted by Whig Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky and brokered by Clay and Democratic Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois, reduced sectional conflict.
