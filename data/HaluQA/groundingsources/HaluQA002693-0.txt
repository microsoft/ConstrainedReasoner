 He was the brother of N. C. Borberg and William Borberg and the father of Claus von Bülow. He was accused of the attempted murder of his wife Sunny von Bülow (born Martha Sharp Crawford, 1932–2008) in 1979 which had left her in a coma from which she later recovered but that conviction in the first trial was reversed and he was found not guilty at his second trial.
