 It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1990 after Dr. James A. McIlroy, surgeon on the British Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–16, in the "Endurance", and on the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, 1921–22, in the "Quest". She was launched in 1912 from Sandefjord in Norway and was crushed by ice, causing her to sink three years later in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica.
