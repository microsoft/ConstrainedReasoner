The Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF) was established, by the Organization of American States, on 23 May 1965, after the United States's intervention in the Dominican Republic. It occupies the eastern five-eighths of the island, which it shares with the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries.
