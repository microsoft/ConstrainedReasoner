 This was also the first ceremony in which a foreign language film (Jean Renoir's "Grand Illusion") was nominated for Best Picture. The title of the film comes from the book "The Great Illusion" by British journalist Norman Angell, which argued that war is futile because of the common economic interests of all European nations.
