Revolt of the Beavers was a children's play put on by the Federal Theater Project by Oscar Saul and Louis Lantz. One critic described the play as "Marxism a la Mother Goose". The show ran at the Adelphi Theatre in New York City from May 20, 1937, to June 19 of that year.The figure of Mother Goose is the imaginary author of a collection of fairy tales and nursery rhymes often published as "Old Mother Goose's Rhymes", as illustrated by Arthur Rackham in 1913. A Christmas pantomime called "Mother Goose" is often performed in the United Kingdom.
