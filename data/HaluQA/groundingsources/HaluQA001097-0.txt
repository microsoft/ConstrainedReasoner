Auguste von Müller (1848-1912) was a nineteenth-century German operatic mezzo-soprano and actress. She is best remembered today for originating the role of Dalila in the world premiere of Camille Saint-Saëns's "Samson et Dalila" in 1877. It was first performed in Weimar at the Grossherzogliches (Grand Ducal) Theater (now the Staatskapelle Weimar) on 2 December 1877 in a German translation.
