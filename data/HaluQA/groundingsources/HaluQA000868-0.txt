On 10 January 2016, English singer, songwriter and actor David Bowie died at his New York City apartment, having suffered from liver cancer for the previous 18 months. His death occurred two days after the release of his twenty-fifth studio album, "Blackstar", which coincided with his 69th birthday. The album was largely recorded in secret between The Magic Shop and Human Worldwide Studios in New York City with Bowie's longtime co-producer Tony Visconti and a group of local jazz musicians.
