 Loosely based on the superhero team of the same name by Marvel Comics, the film is the 54th Disney animated feature film. Beginning his career as a professional actor at the age of 15, Potter is perhaps best known for his starring role as Mike Fukanaga in "Supah Ninjas" and for voicing Hiro Hamada in "Big Hero 6" (2014).
