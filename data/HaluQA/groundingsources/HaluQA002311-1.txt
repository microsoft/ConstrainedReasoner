Son of A Gun is the debut extended play single by Glasgow alternative rock group The Vaselines. The title-song of this EP came to a wider audience after Nirvana covered it, along with "Molly's Lips", on their compilation album "Incesticide".Incesticide is a compilation album by the American grunge band Nirvana. At the time, the majority of the material on "Incesticide" was circulating within fan communities (albeit in lower quality). Since the songs were recorded in different sessions and some were recorded when Nirvana did not have a stable formation, the album includes recordings by four different drummers: Chad Channing, Dan Peters, Dale Crover, and Dave Grohl.
