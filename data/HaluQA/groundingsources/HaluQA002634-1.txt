Rdio was an online music streaming service that offered ad-supported free streaming and ad-free subscription streaming services in 85 countries. It was available as a website and via app for Android, BlackBerry, iOS, and Windows Phone mobile devices, which could stream music from Rdio's servers or download music for offline playback; there were also clients for the Roku and Sonos systems. The name comes from the Japanese word å…­ (roku ) meaning "six" and was named so because it was the sixth company that Anthony Wood (CEO 2002-) started.
