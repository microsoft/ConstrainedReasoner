John Powers Severin (December 26, 1921 â€“ February 12, 2012) was an American comics artist noted for his distinctive work with EC Comics, primarily on the war comics "Two-Fisted Tales" and "Frontline Combat"; for Marvel Comics, especially its war and Western comics; and for his 45-year stint with the satiric magazine "Cracked". Founded in 1958, "Cracked" proved to be the most durable of the many publications to be launched in the wake of "Mad" magazine.
