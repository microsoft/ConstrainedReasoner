Exochorda is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to China and central Asia (Turkestan). Numerous species have been described on the basis of differing appearance and geographical separation, but a systematic study revealed that the different types are closely related and probably all descended from a single species that formerly had a wide distribution that has been fragmented by habitat loss.A lime (from French "lime", from Arabic "līma", from Persian "līmū", "lemon") is a hybrid citrus fruit, which is typically round, lime green, 3 – in diameter, and contains acidic juice vesicles.
