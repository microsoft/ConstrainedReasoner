Pepper's ghost is an illusion technique used in theatre, amusement parks, museums, television, and concerts. Examples of the illusion are the Girl-to-Gorilla trick found in old carnival sideshows and the appearance of "Ghosts" at the Haunted Mansion and the "Blue Fairy" in Pinocchio's Daring Journey at the Disneyland park in California.Pinocchio's Daring Journey is a dark ride at Disneyland in California; Tokyo Disneyland; and the Disneyland Park in Paris. The Pepper's Ghost illusion (used extensively in the Haunted Mansion) is used when the Blue Fairy disappears, leaving a pile of fiber-optic fairy dust on the floor.
