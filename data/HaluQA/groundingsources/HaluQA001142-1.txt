Dicksboro is a Gaelic Athletic Association club located in Kilkenny, Ireland. The city is administered by a borough council (and a mayor), which is a level below that of city council in the local government of the state, although the Local Government Act 2001 allows for "the continued use of the description city". The borough's population is 8,711, but the majority live outside the borough boundary: the 2011 Irish census gave the total population of the borough and environs as 24,423.
