 The first four tracks, all recorded in August, 1958, are outtakes from "The Fabulous Johnny Cash", and also appear on the CD re-release of that album. It was released on November 3, 1958 by Columbia Records, long after Cash's departure from Sun Records, and was re-issued in 2002 by Sony Music's Legacy imprint.
