Fairview is a small census-designated place on the boundary between Christian and Todd counties in the western part of the U.S. state of Kentucky. It is chiefly notable as the birthplace of Jefferson Davis, later President of the Confederate States of America, and as the location of the Jefferson Davis State Historic Site. He was the 23rd United States Secretary of War, serving under U.S. President Franklin Pierce from 1853 to 1857.
