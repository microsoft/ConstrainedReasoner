 The district has been popular with artists for some time, and has been compared to Montmartre in Paris and to Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen, due to its bohemic and laissez-faire atmosphere. It was temporarily closed by residents in April 2011 while discussions continued with the Danish government about its future, but then re-opened to the public.
