John Frederick "Jack" Maitland (born February 8, 1948) is a former American football running back in the National Football League in the 1970s and earned a Super Bowl ring. Since only one Vince Lombardi Trophy is awarded to the team (ownership) itself, the Super Bowl ring offers a collectible memento for the actual players and team members to keep for themselves to symbolize the victory.
