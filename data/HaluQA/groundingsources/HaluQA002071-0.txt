Monty Python's Life of Brian is the second soundtrack album by Monty Python, released in 1979 alongside the film of the same name. The album opens with a brief rendition of "Hava Nagila" on Scottish bagpipes, which had earlier been considered for use in a scene later cut from the film."Hava Nagila" (Hebrew: הבה נגילה‎ , "Havah Nagilah", "Let us rejoice") is an Israeli folk song traditionally sung at Jewish celebrations.
