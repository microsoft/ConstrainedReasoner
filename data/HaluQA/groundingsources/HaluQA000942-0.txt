 In the original version, it is a thin, jerky-like salami; variations include a poultry-based salami, a salami wrapped in a white or wheat roll (BiFi Roll and BiFi Roll Korn), a roll filled with beef, beans and bacon (Ranger), and a roll filled with salami, cheese, and pizza sauce (BiFi Carazza).Tomato sauce (also known as Neapolitan sauce, and referred to in Italy as Salsa di pomodoro) refers to any of a very large number of sauces made primarily from tomatoes, usually to be served as part of a dish (rather than as a condiment).
