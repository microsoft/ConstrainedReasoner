"Can't Stop Thinking About You" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released in 1975 on his final album for Apple Records, "Extra Texture (Read All About It)". A love song in the style of a soul/R&B ballad, it was written by Harrison in December 1973, towards the end of his marriage to Pattie Boyd and while he was having an affair with Maureen Starkey, the wife of his former Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr. They married at the Caxton Hall Register Office, London, in 1965, and divorced in 1975.
