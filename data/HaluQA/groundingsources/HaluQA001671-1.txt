Joseph Paul Franklin (born James Clayton Vaughn, Jr.; April 13, 1950 – November 20, 2013) was an American serial killer who gained notoriety for numerous murders in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His killing spree was the subject of a fictional novel entitled "Hunter" by White supremacist William L. Pierce, who said of Franklin that “he saw his duty as a white man and did what a responsible son of his race must do.” Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.
