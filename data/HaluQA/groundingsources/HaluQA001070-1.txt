George Edward Lowe (born November 10, 1958) is an American voice actor and comedian. Though the original 1960s series aired as a standard Hanna-Barbera Saturday-morning superhero cartoon, "Space Ghost Coast to Coast" was a total reboot of the series intended for adults, now reinterpreted as a surreal spoof talk show and produced using the original artwork.
