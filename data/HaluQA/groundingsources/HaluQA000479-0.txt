Something's Got to Give is an unfinished 1962 American feature film, directed by George Cukor for Twentieth Century-Fox and starring Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse. A remake of "My Favorite Wife" (1940), a screwball comedy starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, it was Monroe's last work, but from the beginning its production was disrupted by her personal troubles, and after her death on August 5, 1962, the film was abandoned.Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 â€“ August 5, 1962) was an American actress and model. Famous for playing comic "dumb blonde" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and was emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality.
