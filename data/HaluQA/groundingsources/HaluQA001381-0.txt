Shabbethai Donnolo (913 – c. 982, Hebrew: שבתי דונולו‎ ) was a Graeco-Italian Jewish physician, and writer on medicine and astrology born at Oria, Apulia. When twelve years of age he was made prisoner by the Arabs under the leadership of the Fatimite Abu Ahmad Ja'far ibn 'Ubaid, but was ransomed by his relatives at Otranto, while the rest of his family was carried to Palermo and North Africa.Palermo (] , Sicilian: "Palermu", Latin: "Panormus" , from Greek: Πάνορμος , "Panormos") is a city of Southern Italy, the capital of both the autonomous region of Sicily and the Metropolitan City of Palermo.
