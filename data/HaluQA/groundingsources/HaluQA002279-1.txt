Carleton University is a comprehensive university located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The enabling legislation is "The Carleton University Act, 1952, S.O. 1952." It was founded on rented premises in 1942, and grew to meet the needs of returning World War II veterans and later became Ontario's first private, non-denominational college. Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day town of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892.
