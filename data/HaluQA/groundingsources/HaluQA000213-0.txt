 He made history by becoming the first third generation player to play for the county, following his father, Chris Cowdrey, and grandfather Colin Cowdrey. Cowdrey made 22 Test centuries (an England record until 2013) and was the first batsman to make centuries against the six other Test playing countries of his era; Australia, South Africa, the West Indies, New Zealand, India and Pakistan, making hundreds against them all both home and away.
