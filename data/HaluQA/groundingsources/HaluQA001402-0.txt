The Walt Disney World Conference Center was a chalet-style building that was designed for small and medium-sized business meetings. It was later demolished when construction began on the Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa, which now stands on the grounds of the former Institute. The resort is the seventh Disney Vacation Club resort and is situated on the former site of the Disney Institute.
