The NBA high school draftees are players who have been drafted to the National Basketball Association (NBA) straight out of high school without playing basketball at the collegiate level. Contrary to popular belief, the player does not have to play at least a year in college basketball, as the player can choose to instead play in another professional league (especially overseas) like Brandon Jennings or Emmanuel Mudiay in Italy and China respectively, simply take the year off, such as the case with Satnam Singh Bhamara, or even hold themselves back a year in high school before declaring for the draft, such as the case with Thon Maker.Thon Marial Maker (born 25 February 1997) is a Sudanese-born Australian professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
