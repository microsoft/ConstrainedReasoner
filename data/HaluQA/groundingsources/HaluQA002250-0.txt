Jumper: Griffin's Story is a novel by Steven Gould released August 21, 2007, as a prequel to the movie "Jumper". The film held the first position in its opening weekend with $27.3 million, but received generally unfavourable reviews from critics, mostly due to the many changes from Gould's novel, rushed plot and anti-climactic ending.
