 The games were in commemoration of the 1800th anniversary of the Bar Kokhba revolt, a major rebellion by the Jews of Judaea Province against the Roman Empire. Some historians also refer to it as the Second Revolt of Judea, not counting the Kitos War (115â€“117 CE), which had only marginally been fought in Judea.
