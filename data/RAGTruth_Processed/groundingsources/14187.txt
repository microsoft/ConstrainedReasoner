I reached out to them about hosting an event there in November, and was put in contact with Asaf. He was very receptive to all of my ideas and accommodating of my requests. Although they no longer serve food at the restaurant, Asaf worked with me and within my budget constraints to find food options for our event. The bartenders were very friendly, welcoming, and assisted us with setting up a playlist through their sound system, and a slideshow on their TVs. The patio is well decorated and has fire pits and heaters to keep the space warm. I would highly recommend the space if you are looking for a place to host an event, or just to come in for a drink. I (and my friends) will definitely be back!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2017-12-29 07:15:27", "review_text": "PERMANENTLY CLOSED!!   (an obituary) \nNo surprise. \nThis restaurant had inconsistent food quality that ebbed and flowed depending on the chef. They were perhaps at their best (food-wise) when Chef Mossin worked there. When he left, food quality suffered. But this inconsistency could have possibly been overlooked.\nThat said, they were very consistent when it came to service. For as long as I can remember....it consistently sucked!! At one point they did nearly a complete restart with service, but again it was the management that couldn't keep things together.\nIt was really such a shame. It looked spectacularly cool on the inside with the brick walls and stellar lighting, coupled with a really nice outdoor bar and patio area, but the shoddy and ineffective management killed what should have been a home run. But this wasn't the only restaurant that they couldn't keep going well. \nThe locals all knew this, and apparently the Yelpers did too. \nSo goodbye Blush. Hopefully someone else will take over your awesome facility at a great location and make it work."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2017-05-07 06:02:56", "review_text": "Ambience is very nice, but thats it. Asked for coffee, the waiter brought cold coffee, no cream or sugar or spoon, when asked for cream, he went and pored milk in a shot glass."}]}
