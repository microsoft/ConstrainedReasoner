The favorites from the old still remain but they have been kicked up a notch in flavor. It was such a pleasant surprise and long overdue.\n\nI get the Korean chicken wings. I can honestly say they are the best at Hollister and now the chicken comes juicy, not dry, and tons of flavor.\n\nI love that Hollister makes their own dressings. I do like getting a salad every once in awhile.\n\nMy hubs was actually pleased with the change and finally enjoys eating there. We will be there today!\n\nHollister is conveniently located in a large shopping area and has an array of beers they brew right in the restaurant. Full bar and some wine to choose from.\n\nHollister has been a staple with my family and we are so happy there's a new menu. Give it a try!!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-19 23:13:07", "review_text": "Waited 30min until asked to take our drink & food order. \nVery slow service, if your hungry don't expect to eat soon you will be waiting along time.
