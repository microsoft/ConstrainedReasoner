Instead what I got was some sick, demented kind of prank that turned the land of gumdrop rainforests and chocolate rivers into my worst nightmare. \nI walk in 30 minute line, which is not their fault.\nWhat is their fault is my cream cheese rangoons with no fucking cream cheese in them. I pay a premium for a warm fluffy dollop of cream cheese encapsulated in a crispy puff pastry but what I get is a lukewarm soggy fried ball sack with nothing but a wisp of the creamy cheese that belongs there. This is not ok.\nOne star for good vibes"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-14 01:22:11", "review_text": "Terrible service; line was out the door, very rude, not allergy accommodating. 1/5 for sure"}]}
