It was affordable and the seating was very comfortable. Evidently, the franchise owner sold it, and it is now closing. This is a huge loss to this entire community, as this was a truly comfortable place for regular folks, families and students to go and eat...and it was almost always packed to the rafters.\n\nThe word is that the landlord jacked the rent up to over 20k per month, triple net, and that was unsustainable for the owner, so he sold up and left.\n\nHow many fussy, trendy, hispter places must there be? I guess these are the only type of businesses welcome in southern Santa Barbara County.\n\nSo glad I left there when I did!\n\nRIP Denny's Goleta :-("}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-01-30 09:14:55", "review_text": "Good luck trying to call them while they're open...which is 24 hours apparently. Called 4 times, and no one picked up even though it was clearly open. Good stuff."}]}
