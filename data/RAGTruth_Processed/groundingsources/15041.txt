She drove from Santa Barbara to Camarillo to meet us for the cake tasting. All the samples were amazing so we agreed to have three different flavors for each of the three layers of our cake. \n\nOn our wedding day the cake arrived on time and was beautifully decorated with fresh flowers. She even let us borrow one of her cake stands.  My wedding was almost a year ago and I almost forgot to give a feedback of my great experience with \"A Piece of Cake\". Her cakes are EXCEPTIONALLY AMAZING. People kept talking about it after the wedding. Theresa makes the best cakes my guests and I have ever eaten."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2013-06-05 17:10:53", "review_text": "A Piece of Cake is not a legitimate business. Teresa makes her cakes from her home which smells of odorous dog and mold. Her home/kitchen is unsanitary and is not rated by any government agency. She prepares her cakes and other \"treats\" last minute, in a filthy kitchen while her three dogs play nearby. \n\nHas anyone ever wondered why you can't get a tasting appointment at her store or in a kitchen? It's because there isn't one. She claims to rent space in a kitchen, however, I suspect this is a lie. I had the misfortune of knowing Teresa for a few months. She would often bore me with tales of unsatisfied customers and I can tell you most, if not all of the poor reviews you've read are worse than the reviewer knows and could describe. Apart from her ruining, or coming close to ruining several events, she doesn't give refunds - rather, she might give you credit so you can purchase some more tainted confections and ruin another event of yours.\n\nTeresa is not a professional cake baker, nor is she any sort of a businesswoman. Some of her cakes do appear aesthetically pleasing and may even taste good, however, if you knew what you were getting yourself into when you ordered a cake, you might rethink your decision. I doubt she keeps any sort of records or invoices and if you knew her current state of affairs, it would send up a red flag telling you how well, or not, she runs her cake baking operation. \n\nI'm not sure what she charges but if you can put a price on not getting sick by eating her cake or knowing that your wedding cake doesn't has dog hair in it, then it probably wouldn't be worth it for you to buy a cake from \"A Piece of Crap\" - sorry *cake."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2013-03-30 03:15:59", "review_text": "I have to agree with the other reviewers: Teresa makes good cake, but needs to work on her professionalism. She was more than 30 minutes late to our appointment and had a really hard time telling us what things cost. She didn't pay attention to what I wanted and kept on pointing me to other ideas. Also, most wedding cakes use fondant and she didn't bring any fondant to our tasting."}]}
