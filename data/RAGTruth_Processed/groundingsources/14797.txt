If you have an open beverage tab at the bar (where they hold onto your card), be prepared to pay for your food using a different payment method, or close your bar check and then come over and order. A little awkward. \n\nWhen I was here last night, I noticed that menu prices all went up $2 from last year. The food is decent but nothing cutting edge. I ordered their Loaded Fries with pulled pork. It was flavorful but pretty soggy at the bottom. The fries were seasoned well and the chunks of pork were delicious. My friend ordered their Wings and was satisfied. \n\nI felt that the woman behind the counter did a great job. She was friendly and upbeat. One thing I noticed was that the credit card machine doesn't appear to inform you when to remove the card from the slot. The customer in front of me had walked away with their card still inserted - oops!\n\nI'd come back and give this spot another try."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-09-06 23:42:09", "review_text": "The order of Brussels Sprouts was not good. It said it was a balsamic reduction and they just put straight balsamic over the top it seems like. They definitely didn't try it before sending it out because I can't imagine the taste they are going for to be straight vinegar. These were $12 dollars, steep as is for Brussels sprouts, no bacon or anything else. Super disappointed, but not worth sending back. Ate with ranch which made it tolerable to get down, but not good. \n\nAlso their selection is pretty limited. The seltzer is 5/10"}]}
