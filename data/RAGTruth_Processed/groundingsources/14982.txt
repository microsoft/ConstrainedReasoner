I stopped in to grab a a salad and ate outside at The Natural Cafe. The service was great and the salad was super fresh and tasty. The price was fair too (Santa Barbara can be pricey). They had a nice water station and appear to be taking Covid precautions seriously. I was happy with my Chicken Cesar salad. It was loaded with nicely seasoned chicken, tomato, avocado, parmesan, and zesty croutons. I swapped the dressing for oil and vinegar. I would highly recommend Natural Cafe and plan to return when I am in Santa Barbara!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 16:08:18", "review_text": "Got there by chance while driving from Seattle to San Diego because it is close to 101. Great food - Zen burger - and very friendly staff. They serve wine and gave great sweets. This will become our place for lunch while on the way."}]}
