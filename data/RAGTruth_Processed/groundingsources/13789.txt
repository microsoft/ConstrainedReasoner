The hostess was super nice and their wait time a lot shorter than the other options.  It took maybe 10-15 minutes to get a table outdoors.  Super nice view and good environment.\n\nWe sat at 2:05p and were given menus.  We ordered right away at 2:15p... fish tacos, chicken fingers and fries, bread bowl clam chowder, extra cup of clam chowder, and chicken nachos. \n\nWithout exaggerating... the chicken fingers come at 2:55p.  Then the nachos a couple minutes later.  Then later, the bread bowl.  (We asked for some place settings.) Then finally the fish tacos around 3:05p.   \n\n40-50 minutes after ordering is ridiculous.\n\nTo backtrack.  The waiter was amazing, super nice guy.  He kept apologizing for the delay in food, which other tables were experiencing.  I felt bad for him because it's not his fault but the restaurant needs to figure this out.  I know it's hard with Covid and people calling in sick but they can't keep 'every' customer waiting over 40 minutes for bar food.  The waiter took off the nachos from the bill, to make-up for it, so that was nice.  \n\nIf it wasn't for the nice weather and great views, we would have left, honestly.  \n\nNow... the food.  It was all really good.  The clam chowder was amazing, really loved it.  The chicken fingers were perfect.  The fish tacos were deep-fried fish, a little too oily, but still good.  I would probably get the popcorn shrimp tacos next time.  The only dud was the nachos; the chicken looked like it was boiled chicken, the chips were soggy, and the cheese was half-melted... clearly microwaved.  \n\nOverall... I would give it another shot to see if they can fix the food times... because of the ambience, the waiter, and the food being pretty good.  It looks like the wait for food has been consistent over months, though, so I don't know if management is addressing it."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 02:38:14", "review_text": "Got our drinks in a timely manner, a few televisions with the games, staff was not all that friendly... that's about it..."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 21:31:54", "review_text": "We popped in for happy hour and had an overall really nice experience. Bartender was around if we needed anything, staff was nice,  everything was clean, and our food and drinks were both ready quickly. We had the poke appetizer, seafood pasta, and clam chowder and liked everything a lot. For drinks, we had the pi\u0144a colada and the cucumber Germaine. Prices are about what you'd expect for the area. Really not bad. View is beautiful too. We'll be back if we're back in town."}]}
