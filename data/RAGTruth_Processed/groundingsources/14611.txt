I had been thinking about the Harvest Grain Pancakes and they did not disappoint. The service was also wonderful (I was nervous reading all of the negative reviews about the service). The plate was delivered in a timely manner and the pancakes were nice and hot. Thank you for the nostalgic experience!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-17 04:10:28", "review_text": "This place is very hidden, and nothing too exciting but I got a birthday stack of pancakes so we went in to redeem them. The pancakes had the familiar IHOP taste, and yes they were good. Surprisingly they actually looked pretty like the staged pictures on the menu, so that's impressive. Nothing to complain about regarding the pancakes.\nThe service was friendly and kind, but it took a while for us to be welcomed upon entering. The place was dead when we walked in and no waiters were around. Then we didn't get checked on during our meal.\nIt's actually a pretty spacious interior and I could see it being quite the family place on Sunday. The only other people that were there with us were ordering off the senior menu. That seems to be the crowd here."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-10-22 18:00:27", "review_text": "Never again!! The waiter (in his late 50's) who took our order seemed very irritated that we were even there from the start. Coffee tasted sour and was undrinkable, when I politely asked the irritated waiter for a new coffee, that most likely sealed our fate. Our food never arrived. We noticed two groups of people who got there 20 minutes after we did receive their food which at that point it was 45minutes since we were seated so we asked our waiter for the status of our order, he didn't say one word just nodded his head and walked away. At this point I was about to get up and and leave but my gf and sister convinced me to wait. After another 25 minutes and 3 attempts to wave our waiter down (as he kept avoiding looking our way) we all decided to get up and leave. Boycotting this business from here on and you better believe im spreading the word. 0 out of 5 stars!!!"}]}
