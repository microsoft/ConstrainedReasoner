Same pictures for sale on the wall, same toaster oven to heat up your bagels, same microwave to heat up your coffee, same wait in line to use the restroom,, same people watching opportunities from the mini patio...Been here a few times over the years and its still the same, but with a new name..Zoma"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2010-09-09 05:24:21", "review_text": "First of all, I don't think this place is closed, due to the fact that I was here yesterday enjoying a delicious LATTE! The vibe is pretty laid back here, the workers are nice, the decorations are urban, and posters are hung by the coffee condiments for movies and local art events. The coffee was really good here, though it was quite expensive compared to all the other coffee places around State st. Overall though, it is a nice change from your regular chain coffee joints :) !"}]}
