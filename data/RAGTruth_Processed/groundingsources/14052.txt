All of the ingredients taste fresh and delicious! The portions are large (for me anyways) and I tend to eat one sandwich or salad for two meals. You can walk in and order or order online (which I highly recommended because it can get busy at lunch time). There is a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, beverages and chips to choose from. Check out the inside of the store for beverage and chip selections. Parking here isn't always easy due to the amount of customers but there are always people coming and going."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2022-01-08 23:04:24", "review_text": "Despite doing your best during covid. There is just a lack of attention at this location. I asked for it toasted well... it's just barley toasted. They tell me they will bring it out to me. Dude behind the counter just let's it sit there. After about 25 minutes I go in guy is just standing there with my now cold sandwich behind him on the counter. HALF THE SANDWHICH DISNT EVEN HAVE THE BACON IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME WITH.  He's got the attitude of I'm just here for the paycheck. ONCE AGAIN SCD PATTERSON. YOUVE LOST ME. SEE YOU IN A COUPLE MONTHS TO SEE IF U GOT UR STUFF TOGETHER."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-25 02:49:44", "review_text": "Delicious sandwiches and awesome variety! I work nearby and tried these sandwiches with a coworker and my mind was blown! The portions are huge so one sandwich lasts at least 2 meals for me, so the price is really affordable. Friendly staff and tasty food."}]}
