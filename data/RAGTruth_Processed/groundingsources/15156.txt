{"question": "difference between kangaroo and wallaby", "passages": "passage 1:Macropus antilopinus is the exception among wallaroos. It is, essentially, the far-northern equivalent of the eastern and western grey kangaroos. Like them, it is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious, where the other wallaroos are solitary.\n\npassage 2:Kangaroos are usually larger than wallabies, which tend to be small (around 60 cm or 2 ft). Though their sizes vary hugely, the largest wallabies measure up to 180 cm (6 ft) from tail to head and weigh up to 20 kg (44 lbs).\n\npassage 3:Kangaroos and wallabies are very similar marsupials that belong to the same family (Macropodidae) and genus (Macropus). (The above image is a wallaby.) Their native territories often overlap, but wallabies are generally much, much smaller than kangaroos with a color pattern that is much more varied. The lifespan of a kangaroo is much longer, and these larger animals take longer to grow, and become more independent than their relatives.\n\n"}
