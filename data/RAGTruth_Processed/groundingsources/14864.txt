That's because these guys kick butt. They make the best tortas I've had in, well, forever. Why do I now believe in God? Disfrutas parks it's truck next to Brew lab. If that's not a sign of Intelligent Design, I don't know what is."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-09-03 04:29:19", "review_text": "Soooooo GOOD! \nTried this for the first time outside of M. Special brewery. The people were so friendly and they completely impressed us with how good the food was and the presentation of the dish! I ordered nachos and my husband ordered a quesadilla and the guy, whom I sadly did not catch his name, combined our food into this amazing dish  I will definitely be eating at this food truck again."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-08-04 03:51:12", "review_text": "This place to me is, Mexico and Los angeles street food wrapped in a tiny place located in goleta. They have raspados, elotes, and last but definitely not least, there limoncitos. A limoncito is a lime filled with coconut shavings. They are good! They also have smoothies and natural ice creams. Also agua fresca(fruit water). I really reccomend this place if you are in the Goleta area"}]}
