'Bold and the Beautiful' Spoilers: Li's Family Secret-- Is She Jack's Daughter?
The Bold and the Beautiful (B&B) spoilers for Tuesday, October 17, tease that Li Finnegan (Naomi Matsuda) has a family secret. Soaps Spoilers reports that the doctor refuses to give any details to John 'Finn' Finnegan (Tanner Novlan). All Finn knows Li's stress is about his cousin, Luna (Lisa Yamada).
Finn presses Li for a reason why she wants Luna to leave Los Angeles. He doesn't understand why his mother despises his cousin so intensely. Li refuses to answer Finn's questions. She plays with her phone to avoid his interrogation.
After Li gets off her phone, Finn asks his mom again why she's trying to drive Luna out of town. Finn doesn't understand it, as Luna seems like a "sweet girl."
The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say that Finn remembers his aunt and Luna as a child, recalling how suddenly they disappeared. Finn blames Li for Luna's panic and demands to know what is happening between her and her sister.
She Knows Soaps reports that Li urges Finn to focus on his family and to convince Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) to come home. Finn points out that Luna is family, and he deserves answers from her about the family secret.
After Finn pressures Li, she finally admits that she will never forgive her sister for turning her life upside down, suggesting that Luna is a result of that betrayal.
The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say that Jack Finnegan (Ted King) likely cheated with Li's sister, resulting in a pregnancy (Luna).
