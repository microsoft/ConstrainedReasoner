They had about 4 homeless people standing right outside the business door. Completely drunk and belligerent.\nI'm just a visitor up here, but I was very uneasy inside this place. The transients were walking in and out of this place like they owned it. I did buy a couple burritos(5.25 each now)-\nOne transient came stumbling up and went in front of me as I was trying to buy my items with the cashier and began arguing with the cashier, not buying anything..\n\nI think I was overcharged for my purchases , but I just wanted to get out of there so I didn't care. \n\nAnd of course the usual 'give me some change' as I was trying to leave...\nI did not feel the burritos were good enough to go through THAT experience again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-01-13 17:33:55", "review_text": "BURRITOS!!! Hubby and I accidentally stumbled upon this place years ago while staying at a nearby inn and so glad we did! The homemade burritos they sell are AMAZEBALLS! \nNow whenever we take a drive/trip out to Santa Barbara we bring a cooler and stock up on the burritos! They keep in the freezer very well :)\nMy personal faves are the ones with brown rice and chile relleno!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-09-14 18:37:02", "review_text": "Ok, if you have ever been drunk on state street or woke up in the bushes after falling down and passing out, which o have done both, you will need food and at 3:00 am there is one place over there where the tranny hookers meander their nights away, a super duper place that doesn't look like much my friends but walk in that front door and hang an immediate right past the microwave station to the coolers of stacked home made burritos that will make you think you died and went to heaven. Have fun now cause tomorrow yer gonna wanna die! These burritos are freaking awesome and get the salsa and grab a strawberry yoo hoo too!"}]}
