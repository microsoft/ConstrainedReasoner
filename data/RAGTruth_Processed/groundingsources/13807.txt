Arizona Republican Announces 2024 Campaign
Arizona Republican Blake Masters has announced that he will again be running for office in 2024, following up his 2022 campaign for U.S. Senate in which he lost to Democrat Mark Kelly.
Masters announced this week that he would be running for Arizona's 8th Congressional District, a seat being left open by fellow Republican Debbie Lesko, who says she will not be seeking reelection at the end of her current term.
Blake Masters Launches New Campaign
Republican Blake Masters has announced this week that he is launching his campaign for Congress in 2024, looking to take over the seat being vacated by fellow Republican Debbie Lesko, who stated earlier this month that she would not be seeking reelection.
“I’m running for Congress, to fight for Arizona’s 8th,” Masters said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Biden has failed. We need Trump back. We need to stop inflation, Build the Wall, avoid WW3, and secure Arizona’s water future. We need to fight for our families.”
Masters, who lost to Democrat Mark Kelly in the 2022 midterm race for U.S. Senate, had also been rumored to be running for Senator Kyrsten Sinema's Senate seat in 2024, but those rumors quickly dissipated after popular Republican Kari Lake announced her candidacy.
For Lesko's seat, Masters will be faced with overcoming fellow 2022 candidate Abe Hamadeh, who also recently announced his campaign for the position. The two will likely have a close primary race, but the seat is expected to go to the Republican nominee in a district that has remained staunchly red in recent years.
