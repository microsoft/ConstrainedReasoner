Well dressed and looking forward to the prix fixe menu we walked in at 9pm to a half empty restaurant only to be sat on the patio.  Upset that after making the reservation so far in advance we were sat on the chilly patio.  I protested to the hostess only to be told that the empty tables were \"reserved.\"  This is where I became enough of a pain in the ass to get the table we reserved.  It is worth noting that the restaurant sat half-empty for the entirety of our meal.\n\nAfter being reseated inside we began the prix fixe dinner only to have food, obviously produced en masse and lacking attention to quality, thrown at us with such rapidity and voracity that we were almost unable to taste its run of the mill composition.  Almost.\n\nAdd to all of this an obnoxiously loud bartender and a waitstaff more interested in taking numerous cigarette breaks, and I'm very lucky to say that we managed to have an amazing and memorable evening DESPITE our experience at Elements.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this restaurant is up for sale and I surmise that the current owner, possibly already in retirement and looking for someone to reinvigorate Elements, has handed over the reins to his inept staff.  This once wonderful restaurant seems to have gone the way of the dogs."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2012-01-30 17:24:10", "review_text": "Came to Elements with a couple of friends for Brunch on a Sunday morning, mostly for the bottomless mimosa. There were 5 adults and 1 child, but only 4 adults ordered food. The food was average- nothing amazing. Once we got the bill we noticed that they had already included a 20% gratuity to our bill, which was fine. But once we got home and compared our receipts/ bank accounts we realized that they added an ADDITIONAL gratuity once we left! Very sneaky. Only thing I'll be returning for is a price adjustment."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2012-01-17 02:33:53", "review_text": "This is really a 4 1/2 star rating...\n\nambiance: cozy, quiet, beautiful view of Sunken Gardens\nservice: 5 stars- attentive, helpful, friendly, prompt\nDrinks: \nwine by the glass: lacking in depth.  Didn't have any cocktails but the list looked great.  Need to come back and order the Firetini that seems so popular.\n\nFood: fresh, crispy but soft bread with creamy butter brought to the table.\nAppetizer: ceviche with tortilla chips- thick, super-crunchy chips, ceviche light and flavorful\nMy entree: panko-crusted swordfish with saffron basmati rice, red and green peppers, and thai coconut sauce- delicious, not heavy, lightly breaded and perfectly cooked.\nHubby's entree: duck breast and sausage with lentils which was rich and very flavorful.\nSide: truffle fries with ketchup- yum!  very generous portion.\n\noverall: 4 1/2 stars, will certainly be returning!"}]}
