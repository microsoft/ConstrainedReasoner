Even though it has taco in its name people come here for the burgers. I like how they give a good amount of veggies and raw onions on the burger. You can chose to get a add your choice of American, cheddar, or Jack cheese. The burger is delicious. The fried here are fatter than McDonald's or other fast food so it has nice texture when you take your food to go back to SB. I like how the employee provided some suggestions when I asked what was good.  I was recommended carnitas nachos but I opted for chicken. I wish I grabbed some salsa from the salsa bar.... bit the nachos came with one sour cream and one guacamole container. The nachos were a little salty compared to what I normally eat but I'm the flavor was good and had a nice lemon/lime flavor to the chicken. If you come by...I recommend trying out the burgers and maybe a pitcher of beer- I would have ordered it, but don't think they do it to go."}]}
