From a loving mother's tragic end in Ohio to a chilling tale of dark obsession of a coworker
Obsessed Coworker Convicted of K illing Ohio Mother Preparing for Work at FedEx
Plain Township, Ohio - A chilling case unfolded in Ohio as a young mother, Morgan Fox, was found dead in her car just moments before heading to her FedEx job. After meticulous police investigations, which included phone records and surveillance footage, the perpetrator, a coworker obsessed with the victim, was apprehended and sentenced to life without parole.
On the early morning of October 28, 2020, Fox's boyfriend discovered her lifeless body, having been shot twice in the head, in their driveway. Despite the gloomy weather, the Stark County Sheriff's Office sprung into action, recognizing the importance of evidence like her discarded cellphone nearby. "Such devices carry invaluable data," commented Sgt. Craig Kennedy.
As officers peeled back layers of the victim's life, a troubling narrative emerged, pointing to Jason Alan McDermitt, a coworker. Although initially McDermitt's alibi seemed strong, his infatuation with Fox became evident as detectives delved deeper. They found thousands of videos and photos of Fox on McDermitt’s device, many taken covertly, revealing an unhealthy obsession.
Further cementing McDermitt's involvement was surveillance footage showing his vehicle near Fox’s home around the estimated time of the murder, contradicting his earlier claims. Coupled with a damning video of him meticulously cleaning his car post-murder and tire track evidence matching his vehicle at the crime scene, authorities had ample evidence.
In court, the emotional climax came when Fox’s 11-year-old daughter bravely faced McDermitt, condemning him for depriving her of a mother's love and milestones. "Monsters were myths, until you proved me wrong," she said, highlighting the profound pain he inflicted on many.
Now, as McDermitt serves a life sentence, the harrowing case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows, sometimes closer than we think. For a comprehensive look at the case, viewers can turn to "Caught in the Net" streaming on Max.
