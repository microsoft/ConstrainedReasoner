{"question": "who were the federalists and anti-federalists", "passages": "passage 1:The Fedarilsts supported the constitution, and the Anti-federalists  didn't. The Constitution is what divided them. The federalists  supported the Constitution because they \u2026 believed it would protect  minority rights and create a strong central government.\n\npassage 2:In the ratification debate, the Anti-Federalists opposed to the Constitution. They complained that the new system threatened liberties, and failed to protect individual rights. The Anti-Federalists weren't exactly a united group, but instead involved many elements.\n\npassage 3:The Anti-Federalists  were opposed to a strong central government, and preferred more  power in the hands of individual states. They believed too much  power in the federal government, along with a national bank, gave  the government too much power, and could easily lead to tyranny.\n\n"}
