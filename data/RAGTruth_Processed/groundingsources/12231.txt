{"question": "why is antarctic ocean a co2 sink", "passages": "passage 1:Dr Sara Mikaloff-Fletcher, an atmospheric modeller at NIWA, describes the role of the Southern Ocean in taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Some computer models suggest that this carbon sink is slowing, which might accelerate climate change.\n\npassage 2:Since 1870, the oceans have absorbed more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels, according to Sara Mikaloff-Fletcher of New Zealand\u2019s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. The Antarctic Ocean alone is responsible for 40% of oceanic intake.\n\npassage 3:And importantly, they remove a large part of the CO2 that is put into the atmosphere by human activities such as burning fossil fuels.\u201d. \u201cOne has to recognize that despite this remarkable increase in the Southern Ocean carbon sink, emissions have gone up even more.\n\n"}
