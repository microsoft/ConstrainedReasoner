UnitedHealthcare Fined $500K for Mental Health Rule Breach
The UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company owes a half-million dollars in fines for allegedly concealing how it pays out mental health and drug addiction treatment benefits, the Office of the Insurance Commissioner reports.
Under state and federal laws, the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) reports, that coverage and access to mental health and drug addiction treatment must be comparable--and no more stringent than--medical and surgical services.
Federal law also requires insurers to perform comparative analyses showing their plans comply with mental health parity requirements and prove such to regulators upon request, according to the OIC.
Between 2019 and 2021, UnitedHealthcare was reportedly sent four separate requests from the OIC inquiring about this issue, OIC officials say. Based on the Connecticut-based company's responses, Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler's office determined the insurer likely flouted those state and federal rules, the OIC reports.
According to the OIC, UnitedHealthcare allegedly failed to address apparent disparities between the reimbursement rates for its mental health and drug addiction services versus its medical and surgical providers, among other offenses.
Per the deal between the OIC and UnitedHealthcare, the insurer must report its approval rates, out-of-network provider usage, and office visit reimbursement rates for inpatient care to the OIC every six months for the next two years, according to the OIC. It must also resolve any disparities between its behavioral health and medical services of 10% or more via a comprehensive plan, OIC officials say.
UnitedHealthcare has also agreed to show its adequacy standards for behavioral health services are comparable to those it applies to medical services, the OIC reports.
Half of UnitedHealthcare's $500,000 fine is waivable pending the insurer's compliance with the order, according to the OIC.
