The employees are the nicest people and the food is just so great. I came to get food for take out and as soon as I walked in, there was a super nice girl waiting to greet me. I gave her my order and sat down to wait, she offered me free tea and offered my kids water as well. The order came super fast and the food looked amazing. I really recommend coming here!"}]}
