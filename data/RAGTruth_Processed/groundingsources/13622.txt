There was nothing on the website that stated they are closed and not accepting ordered. So when I walked to south coast they were closed. I checked my email confirmation and it said my sandwich wasn't going to be ready till the Monday. If that's not shady, inconvenient and rude Idk what is. So I made an order again, on Friday but this time I called. I asked to speak with the manager and I told him what had happened. He said they are working on processing the orders but that I should have received the refund already, I told him it wasn't there and then he said  my refund should be in by Wednesday the latest. So I went ahead and ordered and paid for another sandwich. I even tipped them. So Wednesday comes around and nothing. So Friday comes and I call and the manager isn't there, supposedly he was going to be in the next day. I left my name and number and no call back. Monday or Tuesday rolls along and I call back and speak with the manager Blair. He politely says they are working on processing the orders still that there was an issue with the systems. So I wait a few days and he calls me back, doesn't leave a voicemail, we're  playing phone tag at this point and I finally got to speak with him yesterday. He says the owner already processed the orders and that my refund should be there. Well it wasn't. Just like he claimed a few days before. Now why would I go through the trouble of lying and doing all of this? I even asked if they could just give me a free sandwich and drink and call it even. That's the right thing to do. I even told him I'll show you my bank statements, and he agreed to it. I told him, I'll be there after 3pm, I really like coming to this place for my lunch breaks. So I ordered another sandwich over the phone. I get there and the associate screen shots my statements and then tells me he can't give it to me for free. That they need to handle it with the higher up's. I asked he could call his manager and he refused. So I walked out. I'm not supporting a business that steals people's hard earned money. They took $17.26 from me. They deserve or need free donation. They are million dollar company that lacks integrity. The owner should be ashamed of himself and the manager Blair, next  time you call, leave a voice mail like a true professional. That's what managers are suppose to do."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-07-21 19:22:32", "review_text": "Santa Barbara Life hack, stopping by South Coast Deli makes the day that much better!!

Too big to bite. Wheat roll was not soft. If you like BIG, MEATY, SAUCES sandwich this is your place."}]}
