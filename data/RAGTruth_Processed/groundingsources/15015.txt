The ambiance was great and the food was FANTASTIC. I went with my wife and 1 year old daughter and they were very family friendly. For our entrees we ordered the chicken tandoori and the pan fried salmon. Both were excellent. My one critique was the chicken tandoori had a bit too much couscous, which soaked up a lot of the delicious juices and dried out the dish more than I would've liked. Other than that I was very happy with this place."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2019-07-06 03:44:37", "review_text": "We had high hopes but overall visit was disappointing. The food was very good.  It just didn't hit the mark in many factors -- Service was pretentious, they changed the fish in the special after we ordered (and we were there at 7:30 so strange they could run out so quickly), the table next to us were told about more specials than we were presented, and didn't like that the dessert menu is on this huge white board they bring to your table."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-06-30 13:52:35", "review_text": "Great, unique Santa Barbara spot.  As a local, I had walked by it many times after work and it always looked so inviting.  I was not disappointed.  \n\nAmazing food (the chicken tajine), a fun chat with the owner and excellent fellow guests.  The lemon curd desert was astonishing.  Great live music, not too loud... instrumental and jazzy on the night we were there.\n\nBe aware if you are a party of 2-4 people book outside seating: some of the tables are communal, though the guests we shared with were delightful. Great for parties of 6 or more. Worked find for the two ofus - everyone engaged with each other here and there, but also left you to enjoy your meal with your party.\n\nWill certainly return time and time again."}]}
