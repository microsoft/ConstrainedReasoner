{"question": "how to check a temperature gauge", "passages": "passage 1:Main Features. 1  Reads temperature information from all Intel Core based processors. 2  Ability to individually calibrate Real Temp for each core of your CPU. 3  Program is based on temperature data gathered using a Fluke 62 IR Thermometer.  Test Sensors feature will check your DTS sensors for any sign of problems.\n\npassage 2:With the ignition on and the engine not running, disconnect the gauge wire (yellow with red stripe) from the sending unit in the coolant outlet on the cylinder head. On 16-valve engines, the sending unit is on the driver's-side end of the cylinder head. Ground the wire. This simulates a high engine temperature signal to the gauge. If the gauge needle moves upward, the sending unit is faulty and should be replaced. If the needle still does not move, either the wire to the gauge is broken (open circuit) or the gauge is faulty.\n\npassage 3:While the gauge is unplugged from the sender, it is not uncommon for it to register temperature in the 110 to 140 degrees F range. If the resistance measured matched the gauge reading, the problem will likely either be the sender, or that the engine really is running the temperature that your gauge is displaying.\n\n"}
