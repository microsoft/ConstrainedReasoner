In 2022, a Louisiana mother of 2 and Lyft driver vanished into thin air after picking up a passenger
Mysterious Disappearance: A Year Without Ella Goodie, The Lyft Driver in Louisiana
A year has passed since Ella Goodie, a 33-year-old mother of two from Scott, Louisiana, mysteriously vanished after picking up a passenger. The echoes of her disappearance reverberate through the tight-knit community as the desperate search continues.
Ella, who balanced her time between driving for Lyft and offering independent rides, was last in contact on March 9, 2022. That day, she informed her brother of her plans to ferry a passenger to Houston, Texas. Alarm bells rang when she failed to return home, leading to her being reported missing.
The passenger in question, Brandon Fransisco, aged 37, was not new to Ella. She had chauffeured him before, but on that fateful day, she was operating independently, not under the Lyft platform. Investigations reveal that her vehicle, a black 2012 Audi Q5 SUV, did make its way to Houston. Curiously, it was spotted in Louisiana only 12 hours later and was last seen in Dallas, Texas on March 10. A twist to the tale came when her SUV was discovered on April 1, 2022, sans Ella. Further clues led to the last known location of her phone, which pinged in Iowa, Louisiana.
Jessica Goodie, Ella’s cousin, reminiscing about her, says, "Ella had a magnetic aura. Every room she entered, her energy was palpable. She loved deeply, and her absence is deeply felt. Her children, parents, and our entire family yearn for her return."
In an unsettling turn of events, Fransisco, the last known person to be with her, was convicted of unrelated charges in 2022. He had been released on bail and was due to commence a 30-year prison term on the very day Ella disappeared. He is currently in detention.
The Scott Police Department urges anyone with pertinent information to come forward. Please reach out to them at 337-233-3715. The community remains hopeful, clinging to the belief that answers about Ella’s whereabouts will soon surface.
