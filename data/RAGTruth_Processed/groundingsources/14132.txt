I hope that this was not intentional but the rest of my order seemed fine so I am unsure. Considering that fact that I did not add fries at all to my order it is extremely disturbing that this was added. It was even worse that that the fries were obviously old because they were very cold and hard. This absolutely disgusting and has made me very weary about eating here. I am really disappointed since I really enjoyed this restaurant prior to this experience."}]}
