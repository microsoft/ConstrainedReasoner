{"question": "irs charitable deduction limitation", "passages": "passage 1:Limitation on itemized deductions. Starting with the 2013 tax year, the so-called Pease limitation on itemized deductions (named for the congressman who first introduced it) applies to charitable deductions. For 2017 most itemized deductions, including charitable deductions, are reduced by 3% of AGI over $261,500 for single filers and $313,800 for joint filers (up to a maximum total of 80% of nonexempt itemized deductions). The limitation is indexed for inflation and changes each year.\n\npassage 2:Gifts of capital gain property generally are limited to either 30% or 20% of AGI, depending on the donee. The only way to apply the 50% limitation to a gift of capital gain property is to elect to take a reduced charitable contribution (i.e., deduct the property\u2019s tax basis instead of its FMV).\n\npassage 3:However, for any tax year, all current-year contributions are deducted first. The second 50% limitation refers to gifts (other than capital gain property) to certain types of charitable organizations (50% charities) that are considered first in computing the overall 50% limit.\n\n"}
