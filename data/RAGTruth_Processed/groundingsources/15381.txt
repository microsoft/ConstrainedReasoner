{"question": "what is the normal b natriuretic peptide", "passages": "passage 1:A brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test measures the amount of the BNP hormone in the blood. BNP values tend to increase with age and are higher in women than men.The normal values listed here-called a reference range-are just a guide. brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test measures the amount of the BNP hormone in the blood. BNP values tend to increase with age and are higher in women than men.\n\npassage 2:The B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) Test is a blood test for heart failure. It measures the level of B-type natriuretic peptide in your blood. Your heart 's ventricles produce extra B-type natriuretic peptide when they can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs.So if your B-type natriuretic peptide level is high, you probably have heart failure.The higher the levels are at diagnosis, the worse your heart failure is likely to be. The finding of low levels tends to exclude heart failure.o if your B-type natriuretic peptide level is high, you probably have heart failure. The higher the levels are at diagnosis, the worse your heart failure is likely to be. The finding of low levels tends to exclude heart failure.\n\npassage 3:Test Overview. A brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test measures the amount of the BNP hormone in your blood. BNP is made by your heart and shows how well your heart is working. Normally, only a low amount of BNP is found in your blood.hy It Is Done. The brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test is used to: 1  Check for heart failure. 2  A doctor may think you have heart failure if you are having problems such as trouble breathing and swelling (edema) in the arms or legs.\n\n"}
