{"question": "how to keep rain barrels from freezing", "passages": "passage 1:1. Disconnect the rain barrel from the gutter downspout. 2. Empty barrel of all water. Make sure to drain the water from attached hoses as well. This will avoid any left over water from freezing and cracking the barrel. 3. Clean the inside of the barrel. Over time the use of a rain barrel can collect deposits or residue that need to be cleaned in order to keep the barrel in its best condition. We recommend washing with soapy water and rinsing with vinegar and water. 4. Store your rain barrel in a dry place like a shed or garage. If you don\u2019t have room, turn the barrel upside down and cover it with a tarp so that is does not collect any water or acquire weather damage. 5. During the winter, you should reconnect the gutter downspout.\n\npassage 2:Place the rain barrel along a south-facing wall to keep it as warm as possible, if it is going to be used in winter. Disconnect hoses to avoid accidental freezing and damage to fittings. Leave the spigot open except when collecting water for a specific purpose. Prepare for major winter rain storms.\n\npassage 3:Reattach the barrel's overflow hose when a storm is predicted so the barrel won't overflow into the home's foundation. Disconnect the rain barrel from the gutter downspout if it won't be in use during the winter months. Attach an extender to the downspout to divert water away from the home's foundation. Flip the rain barrel over away from the house's foundation and completely empty it. Store the rain barrel and accessories in a garage or garden shed if space is available. If not, place it upside down in a sheltered area of the yard.\n\n"}
