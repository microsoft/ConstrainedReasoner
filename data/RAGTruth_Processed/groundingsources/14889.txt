Especially great if you want plant-based, vegan, gluten-free options. They really aim to please. This place is always a favorite in part because of the commitment to offering many options and no up charge for non-cow pus milk. \n\nAlso a thank you shout  out to the staff like Carly. You can appreciate her smile through her eyes. They really know service even though you order and usually pick it up at the counter, but they will bring it to you as well sometimes. \n\nThey've got a lot of super food lattes. There's outdoor seating and shade or sun. They leave the doors open so there's good airflow. And there's also wonderful shirts on the wall honoring first responders and celebrating different fire stations.\n\nThey have fresh soup of the day and seasonal additions to the menu. We've had about three different types of the avocado toast. Today I had the savory seed one which was delicious and I feel so healthy after indulging in it"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-08 19:28:43", "review_text": "used to love it here before the menu changed but I stopped in today just for 2 pastries and ended up waiting 8 minutes. Usually no issue with waiting I understand rushes especially in coffee shops but I didn't order coffee so it kind of made me feel like they didn't keep a good track of orders. I had to ask someone about my order and she said \"oh they forgot\" and directed me to the bakery end. My only issue is that once I asked , they had attitude and quickly handed my order to me & then I found a hair in my pastries. Sooo disappointed in customer service and just baffled in the way they handled forgetting my order.  won't be going back any time soon"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-30 21:23:48", "review_text": "1. Friendly service.\n2. Lots of delicious options that are plant-based. Take a look at all the different specialty Taos.\n3. And no up charge for nondairy milk crate I love that. It's so great that they don't penalize people who are lactose intolerant. Or if you choose not to contribute to the dairy industry."}]}
