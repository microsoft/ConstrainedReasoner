The other location nearby is updated and looks a lot fancier and nicer, but the staff here is always very friendly to me and gets my order right and timely. I've never had an issue. The staff is all very helpful and has definitely came in clutch for all my late night taco bell cravings. i love you guys."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-07-21 01:40:32", "review_text": "I'm not much of a fast food connoisseur so I'm not the expert on how Taco Bell compares to other chains. \nThey succeeded at timeliness of the order, it was complete right away, but no one helped me when I walked in to pick it up. They looked at me and then ignored me, so customer service wasn't great. It's also in a dirtier area and being able to see into the kitchen makes what your eating unappetizing because you see the uncleanliness of where your food is made.\nWhen I ate my Crunchwrap supreme there was no crunch and the insides were bland and it was minimally filled. Pretty pathetic compared to the picture. I added my own cheese and sour cream and guacamole since they put little in. Even then it was just a mush pocket of bleh flavors. Definitely my first and last time at Taco Bell.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 loves the Baja blast though!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-12-05 05:49:35", "review_text": "Really wish no stars option existed for this review. The manager was so rude I just wonder who pooped in his Kellogg's in the morning. His attitude sucked to me and my friends and I felt like everything I said was burdening him. I have no idea how this guy became manager or what he had to do to get the position (wink) but I'll never go back again. Thanks dude you suck. Salvador more like SalvaDORK."}]}
