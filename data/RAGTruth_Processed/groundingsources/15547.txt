{"question": "how college baseball world series is determined", "passages": "passage 1:The NCAA College World Series is final two rounds of the NCAA Division I baseball tournament.<br />Before the tournament begins, 16 sites (usually on the campuses of baseball teams that are certain to be selected to participate in the tournament) are selected to host Regional Tournaments.\n\npassage 2:This is a best-of-three series, with games on Monday, Tuesday, and (if necessary) Wednesday. The winner of this series is the College World Series Champion, aka National Champion. The College World Series and NCAA baseball tournament were not always formatted this way.\n\npassage 3:The College World Series can be broken down into two stages: the group stage and the finals. In the group stage, the eight teams are split into two bracket groups of four, which play a double elimination mini-tournament. This is the same format as the regional round that opened the tournament. The winner of each of the two groups advances to the finals, a best of three series to determine a national champion. Like in the regionals, winning the first two games of group play provides a massive advantage.\n\n"}
