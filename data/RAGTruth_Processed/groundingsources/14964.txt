It's a great addition to Carpinteria. I recommend making reservations if you are going for dinner in a group of 3 or more. Their service is great. In the beginning it wasn't, but they've made huge Improvements in that regard since opening. Pricing is on point for what you get. Great wine list, cocktail and beer selections. The food is amazing. The first few times I wasn't sure if I'd add this place on my regular rotation, but they've won me over with their pizzas. Parking can be tricky occasionally, but usually not. If you live near downtown Carpinteria, WALK! Carpinteria is such a beautiful town. I'm very happy to have this place just down the street from me. Keep up the good work!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-03 02:13:35", "review_text": "We ordered rice balls, gumbo, fish and chips, side of greens and two drinks. Food was very good, fresh and well prepared. Server was very professional. Constructive criticism....I would like to see more hot seafood appetizers (all were cold) gumbo was good but cioppino would be even better. The menu is kinda all over the place. All in all...a good experience."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-01 06:53:23", "review_text": "Went during lunch to celebrate a birthday with my partner. Service was okay. Not very attentive towards the end and we were the only people left. Sat around a few minutes waiting for our check. Food wise: ordered oysters- can't really go wrong with that. The squid ink pasta with uni butter didn't have much flavor. Sounds great on paper, that's about it. The fish picatta on the other hand, had great flavor, but beware, you'll still be hungry after eating everything on the plate (fish & green beans). I knew I should've just ordered pizza. Overall, nothing amazing and I don't see myself going back, especially to celebrate a birthday."}]}
