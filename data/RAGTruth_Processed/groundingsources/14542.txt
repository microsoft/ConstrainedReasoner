And that, friends, is just the beginning of a dream come true.  \n\nThis sandwich might just be at the very tippy top of the hot, messy, cheesy, roast beef creations I've ever sampled.  It's difficult to describe the coming together of the meat, cheese, and very little else -- there's optional bell peppers for those who want them -- piled high on a thin, crunchy and unbeatably tasty torpedo roll.  \n\nNice people here, working very hard to manage a large and obviously seasoned (no pun intended) repeat crowd of locals.  And to think I'd have never found it without the urging of friends whose home is serving as a retreat from the desert heat.  \n\nThe challenge:  staying away for at least a few days before I go back for another dive into sandwich nirvana."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-06-03 19:26:23", "review_text": "My wife and always hope the Three Pickles sandwich shoppe is open when we fly into Santa Barbara Airport.

I come here for lunch breaks on work every so often and it is such a treat. I got the Goodland club the first time and now I can't get anything else it's so good!! My fianc\u00e9 has had the meatball sub, pastrami, and Cuban. He loves them all but the Cuban takes the win. Super joyous atmosphere as well."}]}
