The accommodations are fairly comfortable, but it's the grounds that make this gem of a place special. (The food doesn't hurt either.) Get a massage from Vesalina if at all possible; it was the best I've ever had. Also, be sure to check out the gardens and chapels."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2017-04-15 17:16:29", "review_text": "i write this review for two reasons. 1) The welfare of future guests; 2) and because the issue has never been addressed by anyone at the facility since I packed my things, left a day before the end of my $piritual retreat, and proceeded to spend the very expensive day delousing everything I owned -- including detailing my car, fumigating/washing/drycleaning all my clothes that I didn't want to throw away -- before returning home to my girlfriend and the beautiful bed she bought a few months before..\n\nBedbugs. Repeat. Bedbugs, In my case, Room 12.  Infested. I slept in the shower stall the last night I was there because sadly this was not my first rodeo with bedbugs. Note: I am not thin-skinned when it comes to the outdoors. I have lived out of a tent for several summers in Alaska. I love hiking, camping, and grew up in a rural area in the midwest. In short, I am not spooked by a raccoon (or a bear for that matter) or run for cover if buzzed by a hornet. \n\nBut bedbugs?   (yeeeych) \n\nYes, those wonderful little traveling insects -- much like fleas -- that want to come home with you. The kind of bugs that bite and bite -- in my case, my neck and legs -- and seemingly can live beyond any pesticide or laundering. \n\nI would rather have mice running across my face than knowingly sleep in a bed(room) infested with bedbugs. \n\nTo be fair, the young man working the desk the night I \"captured\" one of the well-sized creatures in a plastic cup was sympathetic and saw about getting me another room the next morning.  I was so itchy and disappointed that I had to deal with the after effects of being bedbugged, I supplied all my contact info and left immediately. That is the last I have heard from Casa de la Maria despite 3 emails and 2 phone calls. (I was asking for cleaning restitution and the two nights I was in Room 12 comped to me and that was all.)\n\nThe grounds? Hey, it's Montecito/San Ysidro Ranch country. It's gorgeou$!  And makes Santa Barbara look like a suburb of Bakersfield...And the staff was friendly and mostly helpful. The fact that they booked a rather loud and demanding group of guests midway through a silent Buddhist retreat? Eh, I get it.  Co-exist, people.  Just not w/ bedbugs."}]}
