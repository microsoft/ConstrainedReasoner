RIP Woody's. Bodacious!\n\nAlways a fun eclectic atmosphere and great energy and bountiful comfort food . I'll miss Woody's. And I'm vegetarian! Yummy fries. \n\nA lot of history. I used to go to the location on Montecito Street. They were always at festivals, too. \n\nDo you remember when the Goleta location was Flapper Alley? The old logo is still on the windows. \n\nThe owners are opening a new restaurant at the old Timbers location"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-10 19:53:31", "review_text": "Been coming here more than a decade, found out it's closing down.

I was a little hesitant because some of the reviews, but I am so glad we went with Woody's. Kim was extremely helpful in planning our event even with only 2 days lead time. She was efficient, friendly, and made sure we had what was needed for our small event. Food was delivered timely and it was hot and delicious. The tri-tip and ribs were a hit and there was tons of food provided (and leftovers) for what we chose. I would definitely choose Woody's for both a casual get together or another corporate event."}]}
