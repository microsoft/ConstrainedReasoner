I ordered the same as last time, which was a burrito with chicken, beans, rice and cheese. The woman behind the counter was so nice and my order was ready after a few minutes. The place was busy and I got the vibe that it was usually this busy, which is a good sign. The burrito was delicious and I look forward to my next visit. Thank you!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-08 20:30:48", "review_text": "This restaurant redeemed itself. Very delicious hand made tortillas for the tacos and the quesadillas. Horchata and Jamaica was super refreshing. Yudy cooked our food with lots of love and care. It took a while to get someone to clean our table.

Burrito was falling apart and messy. Took forever and was shot food. They even dropped the wrapper on the floor and thought I didn't see. The girl picked it up and wrapped my food anyway. Fuck this place never again."}]}
