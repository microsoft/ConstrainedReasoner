{"question": "how do cold and warm fronts work", "passages": "passage 1:Stationary Front a front that is not moving. When a warm or cold front stops moving, it becomes a stationary front. Once this boundary resumes its forward motion, it once again becomes a warm front or cold front. A stationary front is represented by alternating blue and red lines with blue triangles pointing towards the warmer air and red semicircles pointing towards the colder air.\n\npassage 2:Cold Front transition zone from warm air to cold air. A cold front is defined as the transition zone where a cold air mass is replacing a warmer air mass. Cold fronts generally move from northwest to southeast. The air behind a cold front is noticeably colder and drier than the air ahead of it.\n\npassage 3:If the cyclone picks up a cold air mass along its polarward edge and drags it along, around its Eastern or Western edge, we have a cold front moving equatorwards. Vice versa, if it picks up a warm air mass along its equatorward edge and drags that along, we have a warm front moving polarwards. Notice that since every front involves cold and warm air masses, the distinction between a cold front and a warm front is which one is moving and pushing the other one away.\n\n"}
