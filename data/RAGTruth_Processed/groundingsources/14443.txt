{"question": "examples of instantaneous speed", "passages": "passage 1:It shows how fast an object is moved. Instantaneous speed is the motion rate of object at a particular time period or moment. If we take an example of a cheetah who is running with speed of 80 miles per hour then it is his instantaneous speed because it is shown as in per hour speed.\n\npassage 2:Instantaneous speed is the velocity of an object at a certain time. For example:- Suppose you are driving in a car and the speedometer constantly varies; this is because the speedometer gives speed at a particular moment of time.\n\npassage 3:Full Answer. The instantaneous speed of an object should not be confused with the average speed. For example, a person who drives 60 miles in a single hour has an average speed of 60 miles per hour, but the instantaneous speed of the vehicle could vary greatly from one instant to another.\n\n"}
