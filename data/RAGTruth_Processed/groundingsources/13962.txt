Tish County standout Reese Moore signs with Freed-Hardeman
Reese Moore, a senior from Tishomingo County High School, signs with Freed-Hardeman University. Reese signed her National Letter of Intent on October 23rd, after committing back on June 25th.
Though she is known for her success in basketball, Reese Moore is coming off a very successful volleyball season. The Lady Braves volleyball team finished 13-8 after a second-round playoff loss to the eventual state champions, the Newton County Lady Cougars. Moore is one of the few student-athletes in the state to score 1,000+ points in basketball as well as 1,000+ kills in volleyball. With the completion of this volleyball season, it appears basketball is the future for Reese Moore.
The 5’11” guard averaged 20 points and 8.2 rebounds per game for the Lady Braves last year and is looking forward to an even bigger season this year. Moore helped lead the Lady Braves to a 29-3 season last year, which ended in a loss in the 4A state quarterfinals to the eventual runner-up state champions, the Pontotoc Lady Warriors. Moore was also selected for the 2023 North All-Star Game by the Mississippi Association of Coaches. Moore is looking forward to a special year in her final season at Tishomingo County.
The Freed-Hardeman Lady Lions are coming off a 24-10 season in which Coach Joshua Epperson led them to a Mid-South Conference Tournament Championship. The Lady Lions lost in the second round of the NAIA Tournament to the eventual National Champions, the Clarke Lady Pride. There is no doubt that Reese Moore will fit in well with the winning mindset of Coach Epperson and the Lady Lions.
Reese Moore and the Lady Braves will be in action on October 28th at the TCHS Jamboree. The Lady Braves will officially begin their season on November 7th, on the road, at Alcorn Central.
