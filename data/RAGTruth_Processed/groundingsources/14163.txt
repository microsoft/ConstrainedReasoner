No one is masked or rubber gloved preparing or serving food. And this is at the height of the pandemic \"viral blizzard\".  I asked how they could do that, not follow guidelines at this time. The young man said \"we just stay healthy\".  Uh, don't you understand symptomless transmission?  Don't you know you can easily infect others? You are serving food! You are fine to say it's OK to walk around outside firing a loaded gun. \n\nHesitatingly paid my to-go order and won't be back."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-25 17:42:47", "review_text": "We stopped here for organic coffee but wow they have a lot of items!

I was very disappointed to see that this business is not using masks despite a current public health order requiring masks. No staff members were masked and there was no attempt to require masks of customers who were standing in line indoors. It's one thing to decide not to wear a mask when visiting friends, but it's totally different when you are operating a business dealing with the public. Do they also think it's not necessary to follow public health requirements that restaurant employees wash their hands after going to the bathroom or handling raw meat? For a place that supposedly serves healthy food, they have sent a clear message that their preferences are more important than their customers' and employees' health. I won't be returning."}]}
