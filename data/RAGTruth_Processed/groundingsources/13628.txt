At most sushi establishments, they bring out the items as they are prepared, but here, we had to wait a fairly long time before  being served, and then it was everything, all at once.  Plus, i really like it when the meal commences with a nice, warm hand towel and some complimentary edaname--typical of most sushi places, but NOT here. Overall, a very unpleasant, unappetizing, unsatisfying gastronomical experience!\""}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2008-06-02 15:01:40", "review_text": "This is a nice place to sit outside on State St.  I was a tad bit early for sushi (they don't start making sushi until 5:30), so I decided on their Warm Spinach Salad instead.  It was deeeelish.  I had a blackberry martini to sip on, which was also really good.  The server was really nice and attentive the entire time.  \n\nI've also been here previously and have sat in their outside area upstairs, which is also nice.  \n\nI'm curious to try their sushi soon, which might alter my rating."}]}
