We also have left a few messages for Dario, who never calls\n\n1. Today we ordered a vegetable fasilli and the chicken brick dish. Neither  was very good.  The pasta dish lacked flavor. There wasn't much in terms of vegetables. It was so disappointing\n\nI thought of taking a picture but it really was such a boring dish.  \n\nWhite beans would give this some flavor and more protein. We've suggested they look at adding some beans to their  vegan vegetarian dishes but have been met with radio silence \n\n2 The chicken brick dish was not very good. Three people tried it and all were very disappointed. \n\nI'll try to add a picture of it.  Very little of it was eaten.\n\n3. The bread is an Average plus \n\nWe used to go here years ago and it was pretty good.  I Food today was from the Santa Barbara location on Victoria Street. We've also had disappointing meals At their montecito location.  \n\nWe really wish they would spend a little bit more time on their items and their ingredients especially for the pricing.  \n\nEspecially given they do not have good vegan options and haven't bothered to get back to us, we think we are done trying.   Ciao Ca Dario"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-18 19:52:22", "review_text": "We selected this restaurant because it had an interesting menu with vegetarian options and many positive reviews. In many ways, it offered a solid choice for our party of 10. That said, the overall impression we had was that the food was fairly ordinary. Pasta dishes were served with overcooked pasta and sauces that were unspectacular. Salads were copious, but almost entirely lettuce with lots of shredded cheese. Bread was uninspiring. Only bottled water (not tap) was offered. The one exception was a pork chop that was reportedly quite substantial and cooked exactly right. Wine choices were good, but overpriced compared to other restaurants nearby. Perhaps it was the size of our party, but our overall impression was that the restaurant isn't really trying. At the end of the meal, we had a mixup with the credit cards. Instead of splitting the bill evenly, several of us got credit card receipts for the entire party of 10! This was quickly remedied, but honestly, at this price point, we expected more."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-18 05:32:59", "review_text": "I've been hearing about Ca' Dario for ages and planned to go last year until covid shut things down but I finally got the opportunity to go and it was delicious! The aperol spritz was yummy, the caprese salad was great! My favorite dish however was the ravioli with sage and brown butter! The flavors were amazing :-) make a reservation & try it as the restaurant is quite small."}]}
