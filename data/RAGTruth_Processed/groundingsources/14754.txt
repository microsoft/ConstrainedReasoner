Looked in Yelp and found this gem. The place was so clean and we were greeted by a gentleman by the name of \"Kenny\" (we overheard other patrons, and we're sure he was probably the owner because he was so meticulous). He was SO pleasant, friendly and attentive. We had the Chili Rancheros Wrap, Pancakes and Tater Tots. Everything was served hot and was really delicious. Wish we had a place like this in our neighborhood at home. We'll definitely come back here and refer others. Have to support these local businesses! Keep up the great work Kenny and staff!"}]}
