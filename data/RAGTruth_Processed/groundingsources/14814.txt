I got the 12oz peanut butter banana smoothie (+ carob, dates, chia seeds, non-dairy soy blend (for +0.75)). It's really great how they allow for a free supplement - I chose chia seeds. I also was able to customize by adding in dates. The smoothie was creamy and perfect, filled to the top lid. Quick and efficient, no complaints!\n\nThis location also has ample parking and is close by Shoreline, nice for enjoying your smoothie with a view of the beach!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-25 04:47:11", "review_text": "Yum!

Take a look! Make sure to say GO SOY if you don't want dairy. They have a frozen soy blend...it's great! Wish they would do coconut though as I'm tech a non soy also person but I suffer it gladly to drink my mmmmmmm smoothies!!! \n\nNice options for those of us who have had it since Art and the gang opened it! I've been addicted since...I literally get 2-3 most visits...I like them when I don't have the right smoothie etc ingredients I need at home or the blending power on the road...\n\nDefinitely worth loading a card with $30 or more to get a benefit if you visit 10 or more times in a month or just to save 10% of the overall... \nConvenient and it's a good idea for us fully or even semi frequent buyers!\nMake sure you reload the card before you buy your smoothie. It can seem tedious, but clearly ask to transact that first then order the drinks, it's the only way it works well for the savings!!! :)\nPlease recycle your card...save them when they're empty and fill them when you can..\n\nAnd..hooray, the cups are back to be reused after a long wait during covid to not use them!!! I've had mine clean and waiting so buy one and bring it each time for a savings and eco reasons! Cheers! \n\nOff to get my fave smoothies! \nAsk to see the secret menu too...it's fun to change it up!"}]}
