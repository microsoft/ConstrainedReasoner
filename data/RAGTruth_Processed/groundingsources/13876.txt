The competition wasn't for the casual gamer; it's a prestigious event that requires players to earn their spot.

"Balancing rigorous gaming training with regular school and sports simply wasn't feasible," Cooper elaborated.
Support has been a crucial element in Cooper's journey, with his parents playing a pivotal role. Reflecting on his father's influence, Cooper mentioned, "My dad introduced me to the gaming world. He even accompanied me to Denmark for the championship. Witnessing the win was a surreal experience for both of us."
For this Round Rock champion, the journey has only just begun. Cooper's ambitions are crystal clear: continue his reign in the gaming world, rake in victories, and do what he loves most for as long as he can.
