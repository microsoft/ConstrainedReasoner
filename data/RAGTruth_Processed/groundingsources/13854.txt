Santa Barbara Dad Ruled Unfit for Trial After Taking His Kids Life Over QAnon conspiracy theories
SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA: In a significant ruling, US District Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo declared that Matthew Taylor Coleman, the surf instructor from California, is not mentally fit to face trial. Coleman is accused of killing his two young children in Mexico with a spearfishing gun, claiming they possessed 'serpent DNA'.
The decision came on Wednesday, October 9, when the judge announced that Coleman was not competent for the trial. This announcement also implies that any further criminal proceedings against him will be halted.
As reported, Coleman's tragic actions were heavily influenced by the QAnon conspiracy theories. In his admission to the FBI, he mentioned that he believed his actions were the only solution to "save the world."
Investigations revealed that in August 2021, Coleman drove his kids from their Santa Barbara residence to a ranch in Mexico. Two days into their stay, he took the life of his 2-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter using a speargun. Following the murders, Coleman returned to his motel room. It was a ranch worker who discovered the lifeless bodies of the children and reported the gruesome sight to the authorities. Coleman's arrest took place at the US border while he was trying to return.
Matthew Coleman's spouse, during her interactions with the officials, confirmed that he had left with their kids in the family van without mentioning their destination. Even though he hadn't given her a clue about their whereabouts, she was optimistic that her children were safe. She also indicated that there had been no discord between the couple preceding his departure.
Documents presented in court reveal more about the family's plans that fateful day. They were supposedly set for a camping trip, but Coleman unexpectedly left with the kids. His wife, referenced as AC in the documents, grew worried, particularly because Coleman hadn't taken the car seat with him. She tried reaching him via text and calls to no avail. When approached by law enforcement, AC expressed her belief that Coleman would eventually come back and that she wasn't in danger. She further declined any immediate assistance.
The court has scheduled a status hearing for December 1, with a competency review set for March 8, 2024.
