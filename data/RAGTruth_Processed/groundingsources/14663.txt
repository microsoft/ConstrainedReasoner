I appreciate their wide selection, their consistency, and their price point, which is dirt cheap for SB. Chances are you like it too, or it wouldn't be the largest fast-food franchise in the country by number of stores. I wish there were 3.5 stars, because that seems more fair. \n\nThis shop is tiny and tucked away in the 5 points center. They have a few tables out front, but it's not a great place to eat unless you're really hungry. They are generally very friendly, although one time I forgot to ask for my free cookie up front and they refused to give it to me. Their cookies aren't any good anyways so they can keep it, but it seemed like a silly decision. Maybe I'll get my kid to TP the place when she's a teenager. \n\nAnyway, Valentinos, South Coast, Sam's, Plaza Deli, and Fresco all have better sandwiches but not as cheap and maybe your kids love Subway too. Certainly a reasonable option."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-04-21 23:17:40", "review_text": "Sandwiches were really good wasn't expecting much but honestly as blown away keep up the good work"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-03-31 19:45:20", "review_text": "The employees didn't seem to care, they also didn't cut the bread correctly and the sandwich was falling apart.
