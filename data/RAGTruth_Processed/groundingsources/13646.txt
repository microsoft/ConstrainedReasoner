Had dinner here the other night and it was simply epic. Best chicken piccata I've ever had. Cooked to perfection, lightly breaded, unbelievable lemon/butter/caper sauce. Asparagus and brussell sprout medley cooked to al dente perfection. Perfect, generous but not outrageous portions. Awesome service at the bar, friendly, welcoming general manager running the show. The home run chef is back and the management and staff are dialed in, so if you haven't visited The Cork recently, as was the case with me, get on in there and enjoy because their game is seriously elevated"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-12 21:06:22", "review_text": "Everything we ordered was delicious! The brunch menu has a good variety as well as the lunch and dinner menu. We went on a Sunday and we were seated quickly. \nThe food came out hot and fresh. Definitely recommend the Seafood Eggs Benedict, Seafood tacos, Huevos Rancheros, Avocado Toast, and Lobster Bisque. The drinks were also made wonderfully. \nA nice and chill atmosphere and the owners are super nice! Would come again."}]}
