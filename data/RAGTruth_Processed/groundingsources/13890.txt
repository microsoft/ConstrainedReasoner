Denver Mayor Urges Texas Not to Send More Migrants
Denver Mayor Mike Johnston has barely been in office for three months. Now he is feeling the pressure of handling the migrant crisis in his own city. Last week, he voiced his concerns over the migrant crisis in his own City.
Since Texas began bussing migrants to Denver last December, former Mayor Michael Hancock was in charge to handle the arrival and their support.
Governor Jared Polis was planning to bus migrants to the sanctuary cities of Chicago and New York City. Both mayors complained and the plan to bus them there ended.
Now that Mayor Johnston is running the City, he was interviewed by CNN on October 6 to discuss the currency situation and the 23,390 migrants the City supports.
Mayor Johnson said in the interview according to Denver 7:
“They’re not asking for help. They’re not asking for charity. What they want is just the chance that everyone wants, to chase the American Dream and be able to work.”
“We have people here who want to work, we have employers who want to hire them, we have a Congress who stood in the way of their ability to do that. I think that's the biggest challenge we see right now.”
“We know if people are here without work authorization, we are going to need more federal support to support them. But our focus is really trying to get them access to work.”
“We think if you bring someone to the country and tell them they can't work, there's no choice but to either encourage them to break the law or to make them survive on public subsidy and we think neither of those are good options.”
In addition, Denver sent letters to border town officials asking migrants not to come to the City. Letters were sent to Brownsville, El Paso, Houston, and Dallas according to Daily Mail.
Denver is struggling to handle the current crisis.
