Know or not know, Daren (conosure, partner in crime and SB local) will fill your glass and chat you up. If he pours it, you will learn about it. He's almost overly excited to talk to you.\n\nThis is not a pretentious wine shop tasting event. In the contrary, it's a walk through the vinyard in flip flops and your favorate t-shit.  Easy and like you've always been here. Siera keeps up with the crouds who show up for nightly Happy Hour and to listen to the live music while offering a smile as she wisks by. \n\nCome to relax\nCome to sample \nBuy above all, come to learn someting new about local Santa Wines"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2011-01-22 18:43:44", "review_text": "What a fun place.  It's very easy to miss, but trust me, you'll like it.\n\nWe ventured over to Live Culture while we were waiting for dinner at Pascucci's.  The staff is so friendly, and helped us choose some wines.  He let us taste four different pinots, and we decided to purchase a bottle of one (slightly pricey, but it's wine, it's not Live Culture's fault) based on their recommendations on the tastings.\n\nAnother bartender/waitress was chopping up some olive/cheese combination and topping it on crostini, which she offered to our whole group.  Complimentary!  \n\nI haven't been here in awhile, but it's one of my favorite little fun places in SB.  Highly recommended."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2011-01-02 20:58:00", "review_text": "What a cool place (despite sightly odd location) ! I wish they had one in San Diego because I'd probably spend a lot of time there.\n\nDefinitely kind of a random collection of things offered here: yogurt, crepes, food, wine, beer. I have to start out by commending their beer selection, but admit my party's disappointment that despite their website saying that they carried Delerium Tremens it is no longer offered! It is definitely a rare sighting for this belgian beer to be offered at a bar! Nonetheless no complaints with their selection. Great wine selection as well.\n\nI also love their crepe bar and boy do they make some giant ass crepes. It was like a dream come true staring at my giant banana with strawberries and nutella crepe.\n\nLast comment: the workers here are super nice and friendly!"}]}
