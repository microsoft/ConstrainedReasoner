This video explains the solutes involved and how they are processed by the nephron.\n\npassage 2:Kidney Reabsorption. Once inside the lumen of the nephron, small molecules, such as ions, glucose and amino acids, get reabsorbed from the filtrate: 1  Specialized proteins called transporters are located on the membranes of the various cells of the nephron.2  These transporters grab the small molecules from the filtrate as it flows by them.y the end of the stream, most of the fish have been caught. This is what happens as the filtrate travels through the nephron. Two major factors affect the reabsorption process: 1  Concentration of small molecules in the filtrate-the higher the concentration, the more molecules can be reabsorbed.\n\npassage 3:Each nephron is made of a tubule and is responsible for \u2018cleaning\u2019 the blood by removing urea [urea: A nitrogenous waste product resulting from the breakdown of proteins. It is excreted in urine.] and excess water and mineral ions.How the kidney works.This process takes place in stages:ach nephron is made of a tubule and is responsible for \u2018cleaning\u2019 the blood by removing urea [urea: A nitrogenous waste product resulting from the breakdown of proteins.
