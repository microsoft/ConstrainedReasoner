It is decently sized with plenty of seating and an area to play pool. They are fully stocked with all of the yummy basic liquors to make your cocktail of choice. The drinks are a little bit pricey, but the service is good and atmosphere is nice while staying at the hotel."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2018-10-03 23:36:43", "review_text": "In the ultimate suburbia known as Goleta, Good Bar isn't a bad spot to grab a cocktail. \n\nI've been here several times since their opening. Trivia nights, work happy hours, nightcaps - Good Bar has hosted it all. I dig the hipster vibe and decor scheme, which is a welcomed change to nearly everywhere else in our little town. \n\nI enjoy the eclectic cocktail selection on their menu. There are also a select few happy hour drinks and food items at slightly discounted rates, and I believe this bar offers a better happy hour menu than its poolside counterpart. \n\nThis place can get pretty busy during peak times, with hotel guests and locals alike. My main gripe would be on the bar's staffing during these periods. There have been times I've ordered food and was forgotten about. My recommendation would be to come here during an off-time, like later in the evening. Sure, the happy hour will have ended, but the extra tier of service received oddly makes it worth the while. \n\nI will be back."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2018-06-23 07:28:10", "review_text": "CLOSED tonight for a private party which is a wedding. I was a hotel guest at the Kimpton Goodland which per the employees is separate from the Outpost and Good Bar. I was a patron as well at the Outpost with a party of 13. Was told to be quite by people from the private party which was a wedding so that their speeches could be heard on the patio which is where they had their dining portion of the reception. Not only did we comply but we shushed others in the restaurant. The wedding guests/party were very appreciative and invited us to dance in the Good Bar where the reception concluded. We went and had a great time dancing until Tyrell the food/beverage manager kicked us out. We kept getting invited in and he kept kicking us out. We did not eat any food or order any drinks, just danced with the party/guests that invited us in. Tyrell kept kicking us out and when we complained to hi. He said \"I don't care who invited you in I'm going to keep kicking you out.\" We told other guests of the wedding we couldn't go in and they said tell the manager to ask the bride/groom who would be fine with us there. We asked Tyrell to do that and he said \"No and even if they did say it was ok I still wouldn't let you in.\" He was very unprofessional and rude. We complained to the hotel front desk and although they offered apologies they also said since they were separate from the restaurant/bar there was nothing they could do. I will NEVER stay at any Kimpton/IHG hotel and once I find out who owns The Outpost and The Good Bar I will never visit their establishments either. Kimpton needs to get this employee under control and teach him about customer service."}]}
