They're in an awesome location with a convenient parking garage right nearby. They have options for indoor or outdoor seating. The staff are super helpful and gave us the option to try some wines before committing to a bottle to order. We opted for the Rh\u00f4ne Blend and it was so good! We also ordered the turnips to share and omg, so delicious! They brought out a bread basket that paired so well with the wine. Such a fun spot to meet up with people. I definitely recommend!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-06 00:43:22", "review_text": "Great food and wonderful service. We've been to Spain and know authentic tapas, Sevtap has done a great, delicious job replicating and then adding their own spin to traditional tapas. The house wine is good too. Highly recommend. Ask for the owner, he's very friendly. We came from the Bay Area and had an early dinner with our kids and the owner was very hospitable. Come by and check it out!"}]}
