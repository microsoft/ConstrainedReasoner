They had very good \"insane breakfast burritos\" and I enjoyed their fish and chips too. Loved the fact that you could sit in a boat outside on their patio and eat. Found out about this place in 2007. It was a lovely little hole in the wall that had been there for 30 years as of April 2015 (since approx. 1985). Was reading that in April 2015 Rusty's Pizza bought the location and was planning to open a Rusty's Summerland in the same spot."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-10-16 13:57:49", "review_text": "I have been going to this place for so many years now, always visiting after bringing my kids  swimming at the beach, to now bringing their kids (my grandchildren) on a beautiful day.\nI have always loved their decor, so beachy and comfortable. Outside is like on a picnic bench! The best part is they offer 1/2 sandwiches, for 1/2 price....not more costly for the trouble, and leaving you the option of getting a bit of this sandwich and a bit of that. That was always my favorite reason! My kids ordered the fish n' chips last time we visited, and they said it was so delicious. I  love their great selection of sandwiches, so creatively combined, like 'The Griller' or the New Yorker...and many more.....Unfortunately, I think their hours and days open have changed, so it's wise to check before going. We tried this past Friday @ 3 p.m. and they were closed. Hopefully, it is not closing, after so many years around. Over 20 yrs. visiting for me....\nIt will forever be a favorite of mine."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-09-03 00:45:03", "review_text": "Thanks Yelp for the recommendation! The fish and chips were the best we've ever had!! The onion rings were delicious too!"}]}
