{"question": "how do you purl in knitting", "passages": "passage 1:How do you do a crochet stitch? In order to do a simple crochet stitch, make a slip knot about 6 inches away from the ball of yarn, then tighten the knot around the crochet hook and grab more of the yarn with the hook before pulling it through the original knot, making a second slip knot within the first one.\n\npassage 2:How to Purl. The purl stitch differs from the knit stitch in two fundamental ways: The working yarn is held in the front of the project instead of the back, and the needle is inserted from the back to the front instead of from front to back. Hold the needle with cast-on stitches in your left hand. Wrap the working yarn (ball end) around your left index finger, and hold it in front of the work. 1. Insert point of right-hand needle, from back to front, into the first cast-on stitch on the left-hand needle, opening up a stitch.\n\npassage 3:Place the stitch back onto left-hand needle, with the right side of the loop on the front of the needle. To pick up a stitch dropped on a purl row, turn your work around, and follow the directions for picking up a dropped knit stitch.\n\n"}
