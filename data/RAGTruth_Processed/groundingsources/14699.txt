We didn't order a lot of food, but everything we ordered was ready good. Butternut squash ravioli is a must try. It is on a richer side so someone with dairy sensitivity might find it too much. I'm dairy sensitive too, but it was so good I had to try couple bites. My friend almost licked the plate after finishing. Veggie pizza was fresh and juicy. Service was quick and of quality. We'll definitely be stopping by again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-13 05:11:15", "review_text": "Best meal I have had for a long time! My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and was spicy. I had the chicken parmigiana. It had so many flavors!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-04 22:15:23", "review_text": "Enjoyable lunch at Mizza with my son. Broccolini and carrots were delightful. So nice when veggies are not over or under cooked.  Chic parm was quite good but not amazing. I can say the same about the bruschetta. Nice outdoor seating with good heat sources when cold outside. Nice, friendly staff. Definitely recommend for people looking for creative twist to pasta, salad, and pizza. Bon appetitto!"}]}
