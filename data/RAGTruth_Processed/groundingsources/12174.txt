{"question": "what can fluid in knee do to you", "passages": "passage 1:Water on the knee (or fluid on the knee) is a generic term for swelling in or around the knee joint caused by an excessive accumulation of fluid. The lining of the knee joint capsule, which encloses the knee joint, produces fluid that helps lubricate the moving parts of the knee joint and nourishes the cartilage.\n\npassage 2:Knee effusion, colloquially known as water on the knee, occurs when excess fluid accumulates in or around the knee joint. There are many common causes for the swelling, including arthritis, injury to the ligaments or meniscus, or when fluid collects in the bursa.\n\npassage 3:If it a small amount of fluid you can rest the leg, sit raising it to waist level to aid the drainage of the fluid. Sometimes if you wear a knee support this will also help the fluid drain. If it is a larger amount of fluid it will make the knee joint tight and you will have difficulty bending your leg up.\n\n"}
