ZERO stars for the service.\n\nWe have been going to Jake's about twice a month for two or more years. We keep going back because the food actually is fairly good, but the service keeps getting worse and worse. We continually hoped that Jake would see he needs to upgrade the help, but it doesn't seem like that will ever happen. I think this morning was the last time we will go. \n\nThe food was at least average, as usual, when we finally did get it. From the time we entered it didn't seem like the servers cared whether we were there or not - and it wasn't like it was busy even though it was Sunday morning. When we finally did get out food both our orders were almost completely cold. As I don't like to send things back (you never know what you will get added the second time) I just ate as much as I could. My wife, however, asked for fresh and hot pancakes as hers were totally cold. The response by the server was the only thing that was fast today - 30 seconds later she was back with the pancakes she or the cook had simply microwaved, not made new and hot. Totally not acceptable. Had Jake been there this morning we would have spoken to him regarding it, but he was nowhere to be found. \n\nAll in all ... experience Jake's at your own risk. There are times when the food is actually pretty good, but when eating out the service can make or break the experience."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2009-09-26 21:23:06", "review_text": "I didn't even want to give it one star. Where to begin? This place seems a mistake to go to. We sat down an hour before closing time with one other customer in the restaurant, and yet it seemed like they didn't have the time of day for us. When the waiter did come for our order (only after the other one on duty reminded him we were waiting), he was unaware of what was included with certain items, didn't ask how we wanted our food done, and generally seemed uncaring. There were more insects than people in the restaurant, which is always appetizing. They didn't check how our food was (again, we were his only customers at the time), and the food itself was below-average quality and expensive. On top of that, they started using windex on the tables right around us as we were still eating, to the point that my date lost her appetite completely. \n\nLeaving the restaurant was the best part of our experience there! We will not be returning, and why should we when there is a much higher quality and less expensive (burger and salad at Jake's the same price as burger, salad, soda and chocolate cake) restaurant just up the street."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2009-06-20 08:44:40", "review_text": "Blueberry pancakes rock.
