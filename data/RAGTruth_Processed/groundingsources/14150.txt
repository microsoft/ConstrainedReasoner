These guys know what they are doing and have always exceeded my expectations."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-02-28 21:28:10", "review_text": "Very disappointed they made my sandwich and then put the mayonnaise and mustard on top of all the toppings which made the bread dry! mustard and mayonnaise is what makes the bread moist to eat the sandwich"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-02-24 19:32:43", "review_text": "This place is a joke , the people working there DONT LNOW HOW TO MAKE A DAM SANDWICH.
