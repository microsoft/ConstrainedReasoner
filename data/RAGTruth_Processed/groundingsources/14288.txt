Was set inside a Ice rink and was extremely clean/tidy! Jaime was very courteous and friendly behind the counter. Didn't even realize I was talking to the Owner/Operstor. She made us a club Sammy with sweet P fries. Tasted farm to table as it was fresh an tasty. Thanks again Jaime for your great service an hospitality! Goodluck to U"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-04-13 22:15:26", "review_text": "MJs is fantastic cafe addition to the ice rink facility. They have a nice selection of draft beer with many local brews. The pretzel is a great quick grab snack and the pizzas are great. The pizza is available for birthday parties in the rink party room as well. The staff are always pleasant and service is pretty quick. It is a great option if coming to skate or just grab a cold drink and food in a 'cool' place!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-03-29 20:09:57", "review_text": "This place is so solid!!
