Growing up in LA, all my family and I bought food from was traditional tiendas and panader\u00edas and this panader\u00eda has some of the best bolillos I've ever tasted.

Even leftover, it was not soggy, and still delicious. I highly recommend this bakery for this cake and their fresh Mexican pastries."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-14 02:39:06", "review_text": "After years of passing by this bakery I finally went in and discovered they have the best donuts. Not only are they inexpensive, they are huge. If you have not been to Goleta Bakery now is the time to give it try. They are located in Old Town Goleta in what should be deemed a historic building and are family run."}]}
