First of all, and most importantly, their food is amazing! We chose cedar plank salmon and roast chicken as our main dinner entrees, along with a variety of sides and appetizers -- every dish was both delicious and beautifully presented. Secondly, Jessica and her team were wonderful. They were friendly and helpful throughout the process of building our menu, and the cooks and servers who came in for the day of the wedding were also stellar -- professional, courteous, accommodating, and attentive. We could not have asked for more. If you are looking for great, farm-to-table style catering for a wedding or other event, we highly recommend Feast & Fest."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-11-11 19:36:49", "review_text": "Fantastic!
