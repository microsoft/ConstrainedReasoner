I was headed down the street to Trader Joe's and saw the sign for China King, and I couldn't stop thinking about a fix.\n\nAfter I shopped, I headed over to the KING.  At 230pm, it was busy busy busy.   One various nice but overtaxed waiter manning all the tables and the \"to go\" orders and register.  Poor guy.\n\nI ordered the pork fried rice, prepared in about 15 mins, and I headed back to down it.  Well, it solved the craving.  The portion was large, had a few peas, lots of egg, and lots of loose strands of not-so-great pork.  Wouldn't order again.  [$11.95, 2.5 stars].\n\nI might be open to hitting this joint up again, but when I have a craving for some Kung Pao Shrimp or the like."}]}
