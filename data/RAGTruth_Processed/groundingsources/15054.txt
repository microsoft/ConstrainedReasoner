Always listen to recommendations from locals at the bar- they steered us right last night on the Mai Tai IPA and the Saison. We shared the seasonal apple, walnut and kale salad and the mand arugula pizza. Fantastic! I've previously had a fantastic burger there, too."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-07 02:41:32", "review_text": "Outstanding customer service! Great food, the fried chicken sandwich was so good! Relaxed atmosphere.

The specials were great- Tri tip salad, curry chicken wings and flatiron steak- all perfectly grilled and prepared, with sauces on the side. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. We always enjoy dinners at Yellow Belly."}]}
