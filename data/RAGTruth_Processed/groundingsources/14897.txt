First the waitress said they couldn't make enchiladas because they had no sauce. Then we had a 2 for 1 SB axxess card and she charged $3.50 for the supposedly free item. When I asked about the charge she said \" the owner told me to add tax and $2.50 more on the free item. We said we'd order elsewhere and left.  The place looked a little dirty.  After asking for an explanation a couple times about the extra $3.50 for a free item, it just didn't seem worth staying and arguing that they weren't honoring there \"free \" \noffer.  Figured if they just do what they want with violation of tax charges  and SB Axxess  card extra charge they might do something weird to the food. There are many other great, clean Mexican options nearby."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2017-08-22 02:56:37", "review_text": "Bad news.\n\nI can't say that I'll recommend this taqueria anymore.\n\nI've been going here for years, but in the last year, something has changed. I'm not sure if it was ownership or management...or whatever. But my point is that this change is not for the better. \nThe chips I had last week weren't even cooked. They were chewy and flavorless. I still do love their peanut salsa, though. But what good is peanut salsa if there's nothing to dip into it?\n\nThe service here is SO BAD now. Seriously. It's kind of shocking how bad it is. All of the women taking orders and running the register (over past year) definitely don't treat any customers with respect or kindness. They are RUDE. There is one girl who works there who I chatted with (I believe she was a high school student) and she was the ONLY one over the passed year to be even remotely friendly.\n\nThis used to be my favorite place to get an adobada taco. \nThe flavor of the adobada is still my favorite in SB, but it's not worth it to be treated like a nuisance/garbage by the unenthusiastic staff.\n\nI will continue coming here for my favorite adobada tacos until I get tired of being treated poorly. \nIt really is a damn shame that this place has gone so downhill. It truly was a favorite of mine."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2017-08-21 03:29:41", "review_text": "We came on a Sunday night around 7:30pm the waitress was extremely friendly but I am so upset with my experience. It took us 20minutes to get our food, please examine the pictures below. I got charged $9.75 for a cheese quesadilla and my friends shrimp tacos are literally just shrimp in a single tortilla. Please look at the pictures. \n\nTo make things worse there were also bugs crawling on the walls!"}]}
