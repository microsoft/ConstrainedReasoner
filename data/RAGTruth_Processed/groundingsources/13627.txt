To begin I waited in line while the cashier was on the phone with a customer only to pick up the phone yet again and take another order for 5 minutes before taking mine. While another staff member just stood there doing nothing then proceeds to take someone else's order that had just walked in. I spent over $100 there and to be honest the croissants especially chocolate were no better than Albertsons and the ones I was served on airfrance put renauds to shame. An airline... this place has gone down hill since they expanded. The hazelnut roll I asked for was grabbed from the back not from the front case which I found weird they tasted stale or at least a day old. The lemon tart was overly sweet it made our tongues pucker with the need to down a glass of water. The $15 stollen was stale and lacking dried fruit and nuts. Not traditional stollen.  This is the type of place that I will forever think of as a stop on the way out of town for a road trip as in fast food. There are better more traditional bakeries in town that actually care about quality and consumer experience and are not just as dark un-updated hole in the wall. Would be nice if the tarts didn't all come in the same mold. Where is the creativity for the price you charge. Service and quality are below sub par. Get it together or stop expanding."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-19 19:09:59", "review_text": "Terribly long wait for 2 latte's. Had to ask twice for our order and had 4 different sit-down customers get served before us with food while they didn't bother letting us wait. Seen the server check our number as well so they simply wanted to ignore us. When they finally gave us the lattes, they were served in to-go cups and gave us 2 smalls when one was a medium and gave an excuse that he put extra espresso anyways. Wish I would've had the chance to experience this place before leaving a tip. Would highly recommend going elsewhere if you choose to be appreciated"}]}
