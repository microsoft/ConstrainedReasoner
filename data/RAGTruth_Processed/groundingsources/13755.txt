It always scared me a little. The reason I'm writing this is to let people know that Wings was recently shut down by the health department. Why? Guess. Because it's disgusting. Oh, I have been in it. When I first moved here I was kind of excited to have a little dingy Chinese place around the corner. I walked in, looked around and walked out. What all of you should do. They are in the process of cleaning it and intend to re-open. Rumor has it in the hood that the people cleaning it said it was beyond gross. So there you have it."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2015-09-24 21:24:31", "review_text": "Thankfully this will be closing soon.  Amazing how it stayed in business this long!  Food was remarkably average and atmosphere yucky.   Locals skip it.  Hopefully something else will come in this space!!!!!"}]}
