I drove up from Ventura and it was well worth it! Absolutely fantastic flavors and the owner, Tommy, could not have been kinder or more appreciative! The whole experience was so easy and pleasant. The mochi donuts are such a unique treat and I must say I am craving them and cannot wait for Mor Doughnuts to return! Would love to see them setup a storefront where scoring a box wasn't so difficult. I will say though I was slightly disappointed though not to receive one of the beautiful shiny boxes like what I had seen in the photos."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-02-25 19:11:27", "review_text": "I was excited to have gotten a box last Sunday. The flavors were so unique and the style of the donuts were new to me and so very delicious. In addition to a wonderful product, the owner seems to be a wonderful person. I was having a bad day and my short interaction with Tommy was enough to turn my day around. Thanks for the kindness and the introduction to mochi donuts! Highly recommend you keep trying to get a box if you haven't already. It is well worth the effort :)"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-02-25 07:38:01", "review_text": "AMAZING donuts!!!
