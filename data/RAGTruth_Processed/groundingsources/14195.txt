I decided to try something new and go with the English Stilton and pear sandwich today...I don't know why, but I assumed the cranberries and walnuts would be in a kind of chutney so when I opened my sandwich I was kind of disappointed until I took a bite. HOLY COW ITS DELICIOUS! Everyone should try this sandwich on Foccacia bread!\n\nClassic faves of mine also include the Turkey and Salami, Cobb Salad Sandwich, and Caprese Sandwich. I've honestly never had anything that I didn't like. Thanks for another delicious lunch today, Panino!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-01-27 23:52:51", "review_text": "A couple of months ago my wife and I had to do some business in Goleta. When we were done we asked where we could get a good sandwich. They recommended Panino. It was great!! Today my wife and I were bored from staying at home cause of the pandemic. We decided to take a drive to Goleta and have lunch at Panino. Again, our sandwiches/lunch were great. Very friendly and good service. Take it from us who drive all the way from Oxnard. Highly recommended!!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-12-04 04:09:52", "review_text": "Depending on my taste buds for the day, Panino has either the best or the 2nd best sandwich in town. That would be the Italian combo on focaccia. Layered with fine meats and cheeses, it's thoughtfully complemented by a delightful basil aioli, lettuce, and thin cut green bell pepper and cucumber. If one maneuvers the meat and cheese correctly, every bite has the most appealing ratio of ingredients you will ever taste in a sandwich. It's like taking a bite out of the Sistine Chapel, or being able to taste the Mona Lisa. If they ever change it, I will seriously write a strongly worded letter to management. \n\nIf I ever were to try any of their other sandwiches, I'm assuming they would also be delicious. The prices are a bit more than average, much as the price of a Lakers ticket costs more than one for the Clippers."}]}
