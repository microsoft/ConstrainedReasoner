I run errands in this plaza so I stopped in for a burrito. The place screams \"clean me.\" Everything looks tired and dirty. The cashier was ill with a cold. The cook kept telling her not to \"talk to me like that. Ever.\" \n\nSeemed like a family feud. The young son was chewing on something in front of a TV. wasn't he supposed to be in school?\n\nBurrito was a good size but chicken was a bit chewy and dry. The atmosphere scared me so I won't be going back."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2016-01-19 21:20:25", "review_text": "The carnitas is very good, burritos are huge!
