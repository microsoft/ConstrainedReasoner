We came on Christmas day. The food was good and the service was great. You can tell they are attentive and care about their customers. We were seated immediately, every item was explained to us in detail, and there is a good value for the price of the items."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-10-24 18:45:16", "review_text": "I love this place. Atmosphere is what you expect for sushi-- Staff is nice and attentive. I literally come here just for the yellowtail. It is the best quality in the area. So fresh and buttery. Gyoza is good too. I like to sit at the sushi bar for a quick meal. You can have a full satisfying meal in 20 minutes when you sit with the chefs."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-10-18 02:01:08", "review_text": "WOW this was fantastic. Excellent service, even while sat in our own quiet section. All of the food was incredible, a very unique menu with a lot of authenticity compared to a lot of the standard SB japanese fare. Eggplant misoyaki and chili poppers were both some of the best preparations I've ever seen for the dishes. The curry was savory and extremely flavorful and the soba was generous. 10/10 can't believe it's taken me so long to eat here!"}]}
