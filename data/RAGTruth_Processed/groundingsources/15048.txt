Bathroom was absolutely disgusting, like it had not been cleaned in a week. Drinks were wrong and kicked out at 11pm (before closing time) into 40 degree weather.  My conversation was interrupted mid conversation to close out our tab an hour before posted closing time. Would've been nice to at least wait for the Uber inside."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-19 07:53:01", "review_text": "In a town that closes down fairly early midweek it's nice to have SB&K for late night vittles.\n\nAnd right in the middle of the Funk Zone, it's always fun to be amongst party-people who are out having a fun time. Right across the street from Test Pilot, and around the corner from Figueroa Mountain Brewery.\n\nThe inside bar area was a buzz of activity, and we headed out to their outside patio area for a nice table. Under the stars and with heaters full blast, it was pretty comfy cozy as the night went on.\n\nServer Hilary was very helpful with recommendations for both drinks and food items, and got us started with the oh-so-tasty Westside Gin Cocktails. And then with all the possible food choices, she recommended the Beef Sliders, Mac Daddy (incredibly delicious), and Chicken Bites. \n\nStill so much on the menu to try, and looking forward to being there for their Happy Hour. Nice to have SB&K as an option for late night dining. Thanks again Hilary for taking such good care of us."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-19 02:53:52", "review_text": "Very cool place off the beaten path. Friendly staff, great food.
