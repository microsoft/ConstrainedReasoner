I got a green sauce chicken enchilada, crispy taco and ceasar salad.  It would definitely be better there, fresh.  The taco shell turned back into a doughy mess.  However, the taco filling was delicious.  The chicken enchilada was filled with pollo asada and it was tender and tasty.  The salad left a lot to be desired; way too much dressing and soggy lettuce.  I was wishing I had gotten beans and rice however, I was completely full with the inside of the taco and most of the enchilada, so beans and rice would have gone to waste anyway.  I will try it again and I will keep in mind the to go\naspect."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-07 22:23:57", "review_text": "Food is good, space is beautiful, service is snotty, not sure why!

The tap water tasted absolutely foul, as did the chicken and vegetable soup, so I wonder if it's because they use the tap water in the broth. The soup tasted like pure chemicals - something between chlorine and citric acid. \n\nAlso, I am unable to eat cilantro, and our waiter kindly checked with the chef if there was any cilantro in the soup, and he was told there was not. The cilantro in the soup was clearly visible when it arrived, and the waiter apologized profusely and said he'd speak with the chef. He then told us that the chef adamantly denied using any cilantro in the dish when it was sitting right there in front of me.\n\nI feel badly for the great wait staff, because the kitchen is absolutely offensive."}]}
