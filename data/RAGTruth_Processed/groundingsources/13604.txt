We loved our flatbreads. I had been craving clam chowder and ordered it here. It was a little thick for my liking, but tasted good. Nice, friendly upscale casual place on State Street."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-20 22:29:32", "review_text": "I had high hopes for this place, but it fell flat big time. I ordered the BLAT with grilled chicken and a side salad. I specifically asked for no tomato and they put tomato on both the sandwich and the salad. Not a huge deal, just annoying to pick it all off. And if you have an allergy, I would not trust this place to be mindful of that. The grilled chicken was not seasoned at all and the food overall was just extremely bland. My sandwich was stacked so high that the avocado all fell out as I was eating it. The side salad is lettuce, cucumber, red onion, and tomato. My bf got a burger with onion rings and he did not enjoy either part of the meal. The onion rings are beer battered and basically all batter. The burger was also unseasoned and not enjoyable. The service is ok. The staff is nice enough but my bf did have to get up and ask for his soda to be refilled and we were never offered a refill on our waters. We both left the restaurant with a stomach ache, I personally felt ill. I had stomach pains for a few hours afterwards and I can only assume it's because the food is not fresh because my meal didn't have any allergens that would've given me that reaction. Lastly, the cleaning spray they used on the tables just smelled funky. Idk how to explain it but we actually moved to an outside table because the inside one smelled so musty and mildewy.\n\nThe patio is nice, but not worth coming back for. Additionally, the menu is too scattered and overwhelming. I think they should stick to one type of food and work on increasing the quality rather than having too many different menu options that aren't cohesive."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-29 20:45:43", "review_text": "We have been here a few times during trial over the past couple weeks and it is awesome.  I keep ordering the burrito but everyone seems to enjoy their food.  The one piece of feedback would be the Spanish soup seems to change - from not too spicy to spicy."}]}
