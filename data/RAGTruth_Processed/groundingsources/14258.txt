Some quite unique spirits and one of the best gins I've had. My wife can't stand gin, but insisted we buy a bottle. Definitely worth stopping by."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-04-15 05:15:08", "review_text": "Such a wonderful distillery/tasting room! Michael, the owner, is so friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming. We tried 5 different spirits and they were all great!! We especially liked the gin and brought a bottle home. I hope you support this amazing local business!! Highly recommended!!"}]}
