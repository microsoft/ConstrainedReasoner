{"question": "how to bake pizza rolls", "passages": "passage 1:1 Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line two large baking sheets2 with silicone baking mats (preferred for ease) or parchment paper.  Prepare pizza dough through step 7, including letting the two balls of dough rest for 15 minutes. Roll out both dough balls onto a lightly floured surface or directly on silicone baking mats.\n\npassage 2:1 Dip the bottom of each roll into cornmeal and place 12 on each baking sheet, cornmeal side down. Sprinkle the tops of the rolls with parmesan cheese.  Bake each batch for 20 minutes or until the sides are lightly browned. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve with extra pizza sauce for dipping.\n\npassage 3:To prevent the filling from making your pizza rolls soggy, brush the tops lightly with 1 teaspoon olive oil each. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough rectangles to prevent bubbling. See photo above for visual. Spread 1/3 cup pizza sauce on top of each dough rectangle.\n\n"}
