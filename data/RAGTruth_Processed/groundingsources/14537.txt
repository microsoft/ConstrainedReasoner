It's a sit down place but one must order at the counter. So it's a half fast food/half restaurant experience. \n\nPros: lightening fast food, free parking, plenty of outdoor seating. Excellent sauces.\n\nCons: the enchiladas were hard and inedible because they were impossible to cut with a knife or to chew. No salsa's or pico are served with the chips. You receive a basket of plain chips and that's it. I think they must microwave to reheat their food? Why would the tortillas have a hard, leathery consistency like that?\n\nI love their sauces and grilled meat filling, but that's about it. I wish I could have eaten the full meal I ordered but I had to eat the filling only, because the tortilla wasn't edible. \n\nThe food is plated delightfully and fulfills the visual senses. The food would be delicious if it was prepared in the right way. \n\nHonestly, I will probably head to Carlitos for Mexican food next time because it's more affordable, delicious, and generous. I don't regret coming here to experiment, but it didn't meet my expectations."}]}
