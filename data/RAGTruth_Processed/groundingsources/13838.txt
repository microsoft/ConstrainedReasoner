LA Models Found Dead: Police Issue Public Alert
Rising safety concerns: authorities investigate mysterious deaths of two LA-based models
The Los Angeles Police Department has issued a warning for the public following the murders of two LA-based models in September.
On September 12, patrol officers conducted a welfare check on Maleesa Mooney at the request of her family. They had grown concerned over the weekend when Maleesa stopped answering her phone.
When officers arrived at her apartment, they discovered thirty-one-year-old Maleesa deceased inside. Her cause of death, at this point in time, is unknown, but it has been confirmed to have been a homicide. Maleesa was primarily a real estate agent but also modeled as a side gig.
Days earlier, on September 10, in the same neighborhood, another woman named Nikki Coats was discovered deceased in her apartment. The thirty-two-year-old also worked as a model.
Nikki had also stopped responding to messages, and it was her family that had requested a welfare check.
Both women lived in luxury apartments in the Bunker Hill area of Los Angeles.
Nikki’s cause of death has not been made public at this time, and her death has so far been unclassified. However, her family believes foul play is involved and stated that Nikki was “unrecognizable.”
Nikki had last been heard from on September 8, when she left for a date only days before Maleesa’s murder. At this time, it is unknown who Nikki met with on that date.
Both women were found only three miles apart, in separate but nearby buildings. At this time, the LAPD is releasing a lot of information about these cases, as it is an ongoing and evolving situation.
Anyone with information is asked to call the LAPD.
