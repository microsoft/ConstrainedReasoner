We ordered the chicken tikka masala combinations.  The dal was nicely flavored.  Loved the raita!  The matar aloo was very good as well.  Only thing that could have been better was that the chicken was a bit dry.  Our plates came with ample rice and naan.  Nice meal at a great price!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-07 05:43:14", "review_text": "Absolutely horrendous food. These guys should really stop calling themselves as Flavors of India as they have the worst chicken biryani that I have ever had. The biryani was more like chicken pullao, and served with no raita and salan. The paneer tika had too much orange color and chewy paneer.\n\nWorst part is their claim that these flavors are based  on the demographics. If that's the case they should call is fusion food not, flavors of India. If you ever eat here, remember, Indian food tastes much better!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 20:13:34", "review_text": "The best in SB!! Definitely give this place your business!! Food is authentic and service is the best. They gave my friends and I free dessert AND I saw that they pay their employees very well. Just an all around good local spot to support."}]}
