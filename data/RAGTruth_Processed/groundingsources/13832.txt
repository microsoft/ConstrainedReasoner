Washington, D.C. - John Edward Crowley, a 52-year-old from Windermere, Florida, faced trial before U.S. District Court Judge Trevor N. McFadden and was found guilty of one felony and three misdemeanors related to his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol.
Key Points
Charges against Crowley include civil disorder (a felony), and misdemeanors such as entering a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct therein, and hindering movement through the Capitol building or grounds.
Trial evidence pointed out that Crowley traveled to Washington, D.C., from Florida for the “Stop the Steal” rally held by the former president. He was in company with the Guardians of Freedom, some of whom support the Three Percenters' ideology.
After the rally, Crowley, equipped with a tactical vest and belt, joined other rioters at the Capitol. The group reached the Lower West Terrace Tunnel around 3:30 p.m., where violent confrontations with law enforcement ensued.
At around 3:56 p.m., Crowley was seen actively confronting police officers, even allowing a fellow rioter to use him as a step to kick at the officers.
Despite being sprayed with a chemical irritant multiple times, Crowley continued his aggressive behavior, urging fellow rioters to join him in the onslaught against the police.
In a telling series of text exchanges later that day, Crowley confirmed his presence at the scene and boasted about being pepper-sprayed three times. He expressed his resentment against what he termed a "fraudulent election."
Crowley's arrest took place on Aug. 24, 2022, in his hometown of Windermere. Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 19, 2024.
