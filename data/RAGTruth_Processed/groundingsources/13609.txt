She took the time to explain in detail each wine we chose for our flights. We also had 3 small dogs with us and she came out with dog treats to make sure they weren't forgotten. Also, the chocolate truffles were to die for. Needless to say we had an amazing time and left with a couple bottles of their fantastic wines and sparkling ros\u00e9. Definitely coming back the next time we're in Santa Barbara!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-21 14:06:06", "review_text": "Fantastic wine tasting experience with great patio vibes!! We came here before our dinner over at The Lark and had a wonderful time tasting some exceptional wine. We were helped by Jordy (sp?) who provided us with an exceptional wine tasting experience and was super nice and fun to talk to. We posted up on their patio and first tasted a few of their bubbles. We both LOVE champagne/sparkling and since we each got our own tasting we got to try a good variety...our favorite was probably the 2017 Blanc de Blancs! We then moved on to try their Pinot Noirs and seriously every one we tried was phenomenal!! I went with the 2018 Estate, 2017 One Palm, and 2017 Pommard. On their menu it was explained the tasting notes go from a little lighter down to something a little more darker/bold in flavor so it was really fun to see and taste the difference as we worked our way down the list. We already had their wine club form filled out by the time we tried our first Pinot!! Everything we tasted up to that point was phenomenal and then you through in the excellent experience Jordy provided us and it was a no-brainer this was a winery we wanted to be part of and enjoy for years to come! This was also a special experience for us as we recently got engaged so being we visited one of the only places in Santa Barbara Wine Country to taste a bubble flight made our celebration even more perfect!! And speaking of celebrations, they also sell their sparkling wine in these glittered out sparkling bottles which would be a perfect gift for someone or something fun for the holidays. They have bottles already glittered-out in certain colors or if you request a color and give them a little less time, they can customize the glitter color for you. Such a cool add-on to offer!! Overall this was one of our favorite wine tasting experiences and we cannot wait to come back!!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-09-19 17:59:00", "review_text": "Five stars for the wine! their Pinot noir's are spectacular. I just didn't love this place. Small tables with uncomfortable stools. Only two options for food are a cracker/salami/nut box or chocolate truffles.  I'm thinking the wine pores are 1.5 ounces and you get five of them for $25. Just doesn't seem like a great value in comparison to other places with a better atmosphere and food choices. Server was very knowledgeable about the wine and the wines themselves were amazing."}]}
