It's just what you expect from a dive bar. A little dirty. A little funky. The pool table runs on quarters with soft rails. The bathroom is best avoided but satisfactory. The bartenders are friendly. The patrons are also friendly, and the drinks are stiff."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-03-22 03:40:51", "review_text": "This is dive bar heaven for me. Friendly welcoming staff, friendly welcoming patrons, rockin jukebox and pool table, surrounded by some bitchin old architecture. The interior looks like it's right out of the 1920's.\n\nThis is a fantastic working man's bar. If you gotta get up at 6 in the morning to go work your ass off all day just so you can do it all again the next day, you are among friends here. Really, whatever you do, your among friends here.\n\nIf Carlos is here it's a whole nother level of fun. Get him a can of PBR or put a couple bucks in the jukebox for him and it's Showtime   -  \"Can'top Carlos\". Love that guy! Love this place!\n\nGood pizza joint next door that delivers too. The complete package."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2013-02-25 23:58:51", "review_text": "Really fun place with excellent drinks and even better company!  More of a neighborhood bar then a dive for sure.  Jukebox has a great selection.  Bartender was awesome...got us a great hookup with a cowboy party bus driver so we didn't have to wait for 2 cabs & that guy was awesome!  Pizza delivery next door was ideal & yummy.  Heard the taco truck across street was really good, often with a line before they even open..next time!  Fresh sour mix made daily for margaritas was the BOMB!   Would definitely recommend this place to go especially since its off the beaten path.  Really nice guys were hanging out here and they were fun but respectful of our girls group.  They definitely deserve more cute girls in there..so get in there ladies!  We will be back!"}]}
