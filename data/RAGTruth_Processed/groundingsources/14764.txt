I looked for hours, days, to find Burgundy Blue and let me tell you it was one of the best decisions we made for our special day. Chase, our photographer, was probably my favorite person to work with throughout our whole day. I wish we lived close so he could take more photos of us on special events! He was such a hype man, got us all smiling when we needed, and definitely caught when the bride (myself) was getting irritated with all those family photos and kept saying its a lot of work but these photos are so worth it. I thank god I listened to him, he was such a pleasure to work with and I know for sure if you have him on your special day you will not regret it. Overall, the company as whole is amazing. Ryan, the owner, from the initial contact was very responsive and kind. I just can't put into words how much of a right decision it was to hire Burgundy Blue. Our photos were beyond amazing and it was just an overall incredible experience working with them. The photos say it all."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-05 20:57:04", "review_text": "We are not picture takers. Our wedding was our first time having professional photos taken. Ryan was so easy to work with. We had never ending changes and Ryan was quick to adapt and make it work for us! He assigned us Chase who we adored. Chase made us feel comfortable and confident from the get go. You can tell he really loves his job and takes care of his subjects. I look forward to hiring BB again for family photos or other events. Book Burgundy Blue! You wont be disappointed!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-16 20:28:34", "review_text": "We absolutely loved working with Burgundy Blue Photography.
