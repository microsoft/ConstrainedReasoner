The onions were chunky and not cooked, green peppers were chunky and not cooked.\nSuggestions: slice the onions and green peppers thin and saute the onions and peppers so they are cooked. The flavor of an Italian pizza comes from all vegetables / cheeses and sauce being caramelized together during the cooking process so the flavors are married into a delicious array of pristine flavors that dance together. There is nothing worse than a good crust good sauce and undercooked green peppers and onions, those two ingredients are not garnishes. Sorry for being picky but  I'm an Italian from the East Coast and I'm also a professional chef. I know you can do better."}]}
