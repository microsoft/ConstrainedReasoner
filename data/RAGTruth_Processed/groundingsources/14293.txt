Shower Bucket. Instead of letting the water pour down the drain, stick a bucket under the faucet while you wait for your shower water to heat up. You can use the water for flushing the toilet or watering your plants. 2. Turn off the tap while brushing your teeth. Water comes out of the average faucet at 2.5 gallons per minute. Don\u2019t let all that water go down the drain while you brush! Turn off the faucet after you wet your brush, and leave it off until it\u2019s time to rinse. 3. Turn off the tap while washing your hands.\n\npassage 3:Water lawns in the early morning or later evening in 20 minute intervals. Use a broom instead of your hose to remove debris from your driveway or sidewalk. Bathe your pets outdoors in areas that need water. Install a shut-off nozzle on your water hose; a garden hose left running can waste up to 20 litres per minute. Direct downspouts towards shrubs and trees in your garden.\n\n"}
