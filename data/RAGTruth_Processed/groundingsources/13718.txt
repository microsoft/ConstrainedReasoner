They had a great time visiting Reunion over this past weekend on January 15th. The manager was friendly and courteous and service was great. My parents had the sliders, fries, tri tip sandwich (I believe) and they said it was delicious. The staff was welcoming and attentive. Best of all they brought out a desert to thank my parents for visiting for the first time. My parents are locals in Santa Barbara and they will certainly be back."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-16 08:52:29", "review_text": "The food is good. The ingredient is fresh. Staffs are young and friendly. I just give 4 stars because of the cocktail. I order a Tequila Cocktail with watermelon, lime juice, and blueberries garnish. I don't think it's a good combination."}]}
