Best Answer: Matt: Students are not permitted to profit from financial aid. If your total aid, including all loans, grants, and scholarships exceeds your school's actual Cost of Attendance, one or more forms of the aid will be 'cut back' so that an equilibrium is reached.Keep in mind, however, that Cost of Attendance is more than just your tuition, books and fees.f your total aid did, in fact, exceed your full Cost of Attendance, your school will hold back some of its own institutional grant funds (first), and then any outside funds-necessary to bring your total aid award level with your Cost of Attendance.\n\n"}
