Their patty has a bit more chew if that's what you're into. The burger is on the smaller side, so I feel that the wait was too long considering how fast you can kill it.\n\nThe chicken sando was very interesting and the slaw was the best part, but I felt that the Sichuan peppercorn flavor was a bit too floral for me.\n\nThe fries, though, completely ruined the meal for me. They looked good, but were extremely chewy and not crisp or light. My jaw was sore for the next couple days. The flaked salt used had good texture, but was too heavy handed. \n\nBlack garlic aioli is worth it if you like a little funk.\n\nWould probably eat again if the french fry situation were remedied. But maybe that just comes down to personal preference."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-13 01:56:18", "review_text": "My husband and I were dying to try this new pop up place. We ordered fries, smash burger, fried chicken sandwich and shared (this is pretty much all the menu options). They also have soft serve ice cream. Included with the fries is one sauce and every side sauce after is an additional .50. We shared all the items and the smashburger stole the show. The fried chicken sandwich was good but the smashburger was my favorite. It has pickles, cheese, and house sauce on it. I wish we had ordered two fries since the burgers were not huge. Outdoor seating at first looks minimal but in the parking lot there is a huge open area with well spaced out picnic tables."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-08 23:56:10", "review_text": "I saw this place being advertised on the Santa Barbara Instagram page, and the picture of the burger got me hooked. I'm here today to try this place out. \nThis burger joint shares the location with a coffee shop, so at first I was a little confused. I really like that idea as, I like coffee too. \nWe ordered 2 double doubles with fries and 2 sides of secret sauce. The secret sauce is delicious and has a little bite to it. If I had to guess what was the sauce made out of, I would guess thousand island and siracha. \nYou can tell the burger is made with quality meat, it taste delicious, i just think if they used a little less secret sauce you would be able to appreciate the burger a lot more. I felt like the sauce over powered the burger. \n\nOne other thing, if you need ketchup for your fries, be aware, it's extra. \n\nI like to rate my places from 1 to 10. \n1 through 3 - will never comeback \n4 through 5.8 - will come back if someone I'm with wants to try the spot \n5.9 though 7.0 -will come back \n7.1 through 9.9 will make an effort to come back and recommend \n10 the best place! (Haven't had a 10 because there is always a better place out there. \n\nMy rating for this place is 5.7 (Will you come back? I'll give it a second shot if someone I'm with wants to try it) \n\nMy Yelp  rating is regarding the service, the experience and the quality of food or beverage."}]}
