We were instantly drawn to the look and feel of the space, hooked by the wines, and completely won over by Betty (owner) and Paul (manager).\n\nWe had about 50 people for our event, mostly located in the beautiful back patio with some spillover inside.  They prepared two huge charcuterie boards and allowed us to bring in our own food (leftover desserts from the wedding reception the night before and delicious pizza from Lucky Penny).\n\nFrom the minute we first walked into Laplace to the day of our party, Paul and Betty were extremely accommodating and helpful.  I highly recommend Laplace, whether its to grab a couple of glasses of wine with a friend or to host a party for 50.  Thanks, Betty and Paul!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-10-19 23:32:00", "review_text": "Great location in the Funk Zone, take the train in or stop by while in town.

Great for a Group Gathering, large or small. We had a large group for an after wedding gathering and rented the patio area. Their beautiful meat and cheese boards were very reasonably priced.  Our guests enjoyed the wine and beer flights and even purchased bottles to drink. Wines from all over the world, (not just one winery) gave everyone many options. Pricing on bottles of wine are very reasonable. Their  meat and cheese boards were beautiful and  reasonably priced.  The staff was amazing and very attentive to everyone. The first time we visited with a small group, we sat at the beautiful bar inside and staff was equally as friendly.  Great place. Will certainly visit again soon."}]}
