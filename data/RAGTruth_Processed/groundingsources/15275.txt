{"question": "what are examples of potential and kinetic energy?", "passages": "passage 1:The kinetic energy of an object depends on both its mass and velocity, with its velocity playing a much greater role. Examples of Kinetic Energy: 1. An airplane has a large amount of kinetic energy in flight due to its large mass and fast velocity. 2. A baseball thrown by a pitcher, although having a small mass, can have a large amount of kinetic energy due to its fast velocity. 3.\n\npassage 2:Examples of Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy. Potential energy is that energy stored in any body whereas kinetic energy is the energy a body possesses by its motion. We see many a activities across us like a car moves,a ball rolls, river flows, an athlete runs, rides in amusement park, a satellite in orbit etc.\n\npassage 3:Gravitational Potential Energy. The two examples above illustrate the two forms of potential energy to be discussed in this course-gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy. Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored in an object as the result of its vertical position or height.\n\n"}
