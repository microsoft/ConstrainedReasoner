The burritos were splendid and the generous side of chips did not go unnoticed. Adam was our bartender, he was skilled and fun to talk too. He's Italian, so naturally I had to ask him 'if he liked Sebastian Maniscalco?' He said, \"Yes!\" (And that is when I decided that Adam and Los Arroyos were getting a 5-star review). Adam made sure we received all of our take-out orders and remembered our drink modifications. Angel was equally up to par and made a great margarita recommendation. Take care guys, we'll see you soon!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 00:37:47", "review_text": "Doesn't have any flavor. Tastes gross half way thru eating it.
