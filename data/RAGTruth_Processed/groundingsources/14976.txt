I was a regular at this place and one time when I placed a big order they forgot an egg roll order. I figured no big deal I'll just tell them the next time to comp me the missing order.  But when that time came a week later, I did, but the manager got mad and accused me of lying and wanting to get \"free food\". When I explained that I order all time and even tip the guys big he said he did care and kept on being awfully rude. I explained that it was about the principle and not really about the five bucks or whatever the egg roll cost. He asked if I want to cancel the order which I did and haven't been back in years."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2018-03-11 12:19:41", "review_text": "Don't Eat hear.

This is the first time we have ordered from this place and the last!\n\nSo I orderd through SB Menu to place an order and an hour went by no order. I called and they said let me check. Oh will be there soon. But next time dont order with SB Menu, call us for delivery\n\nI orderd Wor Won Ton soup with no shrimp, just chicken and xtra veggies: came with shrimp and overcooked veggies\n\nThere was a coupon for free won ton soup and applied at checkout. \n\nWhoa, very scary . Won ton soup was black as tar. WTF?? I have never seen won ton soup black, only with clear broth\n\nI also orderd potstickers , whoa, another scary moment, potstickers were round dough with something orange inside\n\nI also orderd chicken fried rice , how can you go wrong with rice, well , the rice was mushy and dark black . \n\nNeedless to say it went straight in the garbage bag it came in ..I called the owner for a refund and he refused . So will be disputing the charge with credit card company . I have never ever had chinese food that looked and tasted so bad! So we are now ordering food through Mandrian Palace which we had many times and is great . They dont deliver and this is the reason we tried China Bowl cause they do , but never in a million years will we order and waste $36 . I am giving a FLAT ZERO REVIEW!!"}]}
