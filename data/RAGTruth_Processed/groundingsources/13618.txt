In the past, they were very good and the items on the salad bar were tasty.  Now, this food is as bad as a small cheap casino off the Las Vegas strip.  First off, I went there last month and got the Malibu Chicken (similar to Chicken Cordon Bleu) and added a salad bar.  The Malibu Chicken was horrible.  It was like they reheated the fried chicken patty in the fryer and microwave the Swiss Cheese on top of the ham.  The salad bar is also BAD!!!  The soups tasted like they came out of a can, the salad was ok, not the best, and for the taco bar, I don't think the roaches would even come close to that.  Even the restrooms were disgusting and had a bad smell to them.  The only positive one star I will give them is there desert which is frozen ice cream/yogurt with hot fudge or butterscotch topping and chocolate sprinkles or Oreo cookie crumbles.  Overall, if you are hungry and want a good salad bar to go to, avoid this place at all costs and go over to Chuck's of Hawaii.  Thank god I have heard this place might be closing down this fall.  I wish though it was sooner!!!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2012-07-21 15:36:30", "review_text": "This sizzler had bugs in the food. And the bathrooms are disgusting. I will be writing a letter to sizzler to let them know how how disappointed I was with a resteraunt I normally like. Don't eat here. I had to ask for a refund and leave.\n\nThe worst place I have ever been to for food!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2011-08-01 17:04:24", "review_text": "Another place where I'm a regular which means I love this place! The food is really good & reasonably priced. Great for families. It reminds me of places I went to as a kid. The staff are some of the nicest people you'll meet."}]}
