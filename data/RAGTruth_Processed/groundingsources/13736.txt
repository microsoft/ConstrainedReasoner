Unlimited toppings for a personal size pizza is a model I personally love, especially since their pizzas are priced reasonably at just under $10. While Blaze is inferior to Pieology, it offers a nice alternative that is closer to campus for UCSB students. In terms of taste, Pieology is slightly better with their dough in that they brush it with a layer of oil before hand so the crust turns out more tasty and less dry. However, Blaze Pizza still taste great overall, especially if you take the time to build your own to your liking. Their Lemonade is also very nicely flavored. \n\nOne issue I have with the store is that the floor is incredibly sticky during the time I went, which raises concerns about cleanliness."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-07-14 03:38:54", "review_text": "I just want to warn everyone that NO ONE in Blaze was wearing gloves and one person who came in from the back kept putting their mask on and off near the food. \n\nI used to come here all the time during the school year, but today, I just had such a terrible experience. The man making our pizza made a snarky remark when I asked him for a onions and was quite hostile when I was confused about placing the card in the container instead of handing it to him during the transaction. \n\nBlaze needs to get their act together or they can easily get shut down due to these conditions and the behavior their employees have towards their customers."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-04-26 02:27:12", "review_text": "Very grateful for blaze pizza to be open during this time. The workers wore their mask during work, and every time they made a new pizza, they wore a different glove to ensure there is no contamination. I felt very welcomed and comfortable here and the portions they give for the pizza toppings were very generous. Overall, thankful and would come back!"}]}
