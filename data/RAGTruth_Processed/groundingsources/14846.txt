I have never had a problem with the staff not wearing masks. They all do and require everyone else entering the store to do the same. I just love everything, including the atmosphere of shopping without a million people around, getting all of the fresh stuff, and feeling like I'm supporting a local, friendly business. Plus everything is yummy!!!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2020-05-24 03:15:45", "review_text": "Although the business is trying to do good things for the community .....the prices are really steep....just too expensive and some products aren't labeled with prices, which isn't helpful for customers.\n\nA couple examples I bought:\n1 head of cauliflower and 3 carrots - almost $10.00\n1 lb of pistachios - $27.00!!!  Yes, that's right....this item was not marked.  As I walked out of the store I saw what the price was but was unable to return it due to their current policy.  Their staff later said there was a chalkboard next to the nuts display showing the prices; however, in the moment, I didn't the prices and still believe it's better to mark each item with a price."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-04-28 22:59:21", "review_text": "We were not familiar with Gladden until the stay at home order due to covid-19. Since then, we've used Gladden several times for their food delivery service, which I believe is a partnership with Zoomers for Boomers. The produce is good and some of it is organic. The delivery persons wear masks. Some of the items seem to be priced on the high end but overall we're very pleased with the quality and with the delivery service."}]}
