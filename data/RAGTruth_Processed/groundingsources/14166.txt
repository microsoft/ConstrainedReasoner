They had a much wider variety last year. The curry chicken tasted almost like authentic chinese, and I enjoyed the Spicy Chicken every time. They switched around the menu, but usually they had 2 very good items everyday.\n\nNow, its pretty much the same generic items everyday. On top of that, they are almost always sold out, whether because its rush lunch hour, or its after 2 or 3 and they just give up making half the menu.\n\nI hear its getting replaced by Yoshinoya. I am glad because I love Yoshinoya."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2013-03-07 21:26:31", "review_text": "I would say the food was good if I could ever have it. Every time I go to this place they are \"out\" of what I want, nothing on deck, just simply out. Some times when I go they tell me that things are going to be done at exactly 1pm (which may be over 30 mins away)...its especially frustrating when these should be (and probably are) the money makers for the business. Teriyaki chicken? ITS CHICKEN, why is this not in abundance?? Why does the business run out of it!??! Why is there a 50 cents extra charge for the simplest menu item??! I can't make sense of it, I won't be going back, it is simply absurd."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2012-10-05 21:11:32", "review_text": "Best place to eat anywhere near UCSB. It's cheap, it tastes awesome, and the service is fast and good. Everything tastes fresh, unlike Panda Express. Too bad it's gone now."}]}
