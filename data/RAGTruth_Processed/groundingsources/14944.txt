There is no visible menu with deals scrabbled in various location all over. It was hard to see some menu on a white board because the lights were off, and it was really dark. We have to look at a small paper menu/flyer to figure stuff out.\n\nSet up is order at the register and they will bring it out to you if it's not too busy. \n\nService: C\nStarted out bad but improved during my stay. Perhaps staff was caught off guard since it was completely dead at 2pm on Saturday. There isn't much service needed since this is more fast foodish versus dine in.\n\nLocation: C\nNE corner of Milpas + East Canon Perdidio St. Not the easiest to see.\nNext to a tattoo place and shares a puny lot. Street parking might be available, but parking sucks in Santa Barbara.\n\nDecor/Interior: F\nFail. Bland. Outdated. Dark. No character.\n\nFood: A\nFood prepped as you order except for pizza slices which i didn't try.\n\nSalad: chopped up freshly and was soothing. Only two salad dressing options were available: ranch and balsamic. This didn't apply to me since I eat raw veggies often. If you eat plant based diet 95% of the time then your body begins to crave veggies opposed to meat and heavy fatty foods except when driving by in & out. Damn olfactories i tell ya.\n\nChicken eggplant: juicy and grilled to perfection. The sammich was really good. It was a simple fix with grilled chicken, eggplant, cheese and pesto base. I was expecting some veggies for some odd reason so I just added some of the delicious salad to the sammich and boooya! I think adding some red peppers, jalapenos, grilled mushrooms and grilled onions next time would make this a killer sandwich. \n\nOverall: C\nAverage. There was nothing special or crappy about the spot. It's just bleh with above average food. The ingredients used for my meal this time was ripe and fresh. Would return to try other items.\n\nHappy eatings and safe travels friends."}]}
