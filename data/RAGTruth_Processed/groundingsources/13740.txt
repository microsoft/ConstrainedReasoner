Another great restaurant disappears..."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-05-26 06:11:20", "review_text": "One of the best Indian Mexican fusions I have had recently. Concept is pretty unique - Use flaky Indian style parathas instead of regular Corn tortillas with some darn good fillings. We tried the Chicken chorizo and Paneer with pesto taco. Delicious fillings but tons of coriander. Well if you are a person who doesn't toile fresh coriander- do mention it while ordering.\nChicken chorizo needs a special mention for its taste and texture. Must try item on their menu.\nGreat drinks. Spicy habanero margaritas pretty good but the non alcoholic Aqua Fresca - Watermelon was out of the world.\nCasual seating. Nothing extraordinary to mention here.\nFast friendly and courteous service\nI would have given 5 stars but I think portion sizes were small compared to the prices."}]}
