The service was unfriendly and customer service is not a strength. The good was good....but when you are spending $200 in an empty restaurant and they want to charge you for an extra plate...that's bogus. We literally off paper place mats because we refused to spend $4 for extra plates. The portions are huge and definitely share sized...they just will make you pay. \n\nI recommend take out so you don't have to deal with the people that work there or the erroneous plate charge."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2015-06-23 03:52:48", "review_text": "I've been three times.

The portions are huge and expensive ($25-$30). One plate easily serve two people however the policy states that there is a \"split charge\" for each extra person.  They won't even give you an extra plate without a charge. The service was cold. The food was good. We were a party of 11 and were able to try a variety of things. As a Carpinteria local, I will drive into SB for BBQ rather than support this establishment."}]}
