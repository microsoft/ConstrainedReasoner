{"question": "what are the advantages of a fluid flywheel", "passages": "passage 1:Advantages of fluid flywheel. An ordinary friction clutch would be damaged by prolonged slipping, with increased fuel consumption. But by prolonged slipping, the fluid flywheel will not suffer any mechanical damage. Although it may become so hot as to burn one\u2019s hand if one touched it. When a liquid coupling is used with a conventional clutch and transmission, it enables the driver to use the clutch and gears with less skill and fatigue than with an all mechanical linkage.\n\npassage 2:IN simple terms the disc at the one end of the torque converter will be connected to the input shaft. The disc at the other end of the torque converter will be connected to the output shaft. In between there will be one more disc. The whole arrangement will be housed in a housing with torque transmitting fluid all around with necessary seals. When power is given to the input shaft in a particular torque and speed, the output power can be taken out from the output end at the desired torque, with the related speed.\n\npassage 3:Among them the driving member is connected with the engine flywheel and the driven member is connected to the driven member is connected with the transmission shaft. \u017e These two members are not made to contact with each other.\n\n"}
