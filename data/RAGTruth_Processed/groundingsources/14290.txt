Website says 9:30pm on Friday. I drove down to get some food to go, as I get there the guy is closing up the place and says they are closed. Either he doesn't know the hours of business or doesn't give a fu\u00a2|(. So I just told him the hours online say they close at 9:30pm and he said, we'll fix that. I think it'll be a long while until I'm back at this place. I guess now it makes sense why they are closing and a new restaurant is opening in its place."}]}
