However today was a big shock, I had a breakfast burrito which at first seemed to be fine but the potatoes inside were totally uncooked, as if they had been slapped on a grill for 30 seconds and scooped onto the burrito. The other thing was that there was some kind of sour sauce inside of the burrito, which I assume should not have been sour. The reason I assume so is because not more than 15 minutes later that burrito had made me very sick, and I had to miss part of my class because I was in the bathroom with severe stomach pain. Wish I could have my money back; maybe this is why everyone goes to Panda instead."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-10-29 23:50:39", "review_text": "There's a great atmosphere in the bottom floor of the UCen.

I ordered the chickenless wrap, explicitly stating I wanted the vegan \"chickenless\"wrap. Once my order was ready I took a bite and immediately thought it was real chicken. I went back to the counter and the cashiers INSISTED it was vegan. I took it back not wanting to waste money and continued to eat it. My friend who is not a vegetarian had a bite and said that it was definitely real chicken. Again I went back and the cashier insisted. Then they brought the chef out and he looked at it and immediately said it was real. All they said was \"oh sorry\". Having not eaten meat in years I ended up being sick all night since my body was not used to digesting meat. No one who worked here cared or thought it was significant they made this mistake. They ended up giving me a refund only after I asked. This place is horribly mismanaged and if you are a vegetarian/vegan. DO NOT GO HERE !!!!!"}]}
