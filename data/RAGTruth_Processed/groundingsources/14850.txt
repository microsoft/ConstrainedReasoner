Good luck getting your refund! \n\nJeff was the best part of that place . I guess I should've listened to the other 1 star helpers when they said it was hard to get into contact with anyone at the spa, but of course I had Lauryns personal number and she always used to get back to me, until shit started to hit the fan with her spa. I did a 5 star review for Lauryn because she asked me to, because she was going through legal shit with the spa and and her ex partner. Lauryn took $225 for a package of 3 massages and didn't refund me when I asked about it. She said she would have her travel table and travel to me and give me my massages but when I text her, she always has an excuse. Hopefully she's using our money for something good."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-10-17 21:15:54", "review_text": "I had been coming here for a while and really enjoyed it.
