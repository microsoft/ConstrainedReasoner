They have a wide selection of donuts and your typical plain, jalape\u00f1o and cheese, and everything bagel that are decently sized and fluffy and good. Not chewy or hard like other places. The cream cheese requested along with it is creamy and delicious. Their ham and cheese croissant are a quick grab to go sandwich for a meal. They carry a vast array of donuts and are decently priced especially if ordering for a group. The staff is kind, nice and accommodating."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-30 23:32:42", "review_text": "These are some great donuts. \n\nI remember coming here for the very first time and thinking just how awesome it was to try a donut crafted with potato flower (hence the name). They don't taste like potatoes so don't be fooled. If you didn't know the difference, you'd think they were the exact same as the traditional variation. \n\nThe location is prime, sandwiched between the 101 and State Street in the heart of downtown. It's walking distance from my house and I enjoy coming down on a weekend morning. The selection is consistently full of choices and the donuts positively melt in your mouth. I've come when they are hot out of the kitchen and they are just breathtaking. \n\nSpudnuts is known for the Cronut donuts which feature the flaky consistency of a croissant. They cost a bit more than the regular donuts here, but I'd say that they are a must-try. They also have an assortment of bagels and made-to-order sandwiches, though I haven't tried any of these. I'm sure they're awesome. \n\nThe weekend is near and I will definitely pay this little shop a visit."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-08-11 23:47:50", "review_text": "I like this place because its walking distance from my house :) I guess in the past people have had bad experiences with customer service but they've always been pleasant when I come in. The donuts are pretty good, nothing out of the ordinary but there's a wide variety of options to choose from. \n\nNot 5 stars because I always feel like I should be paying a dollar less and they've been randomly closed at odd hours when they should be open (I'm talking middle of the day. This might be due to low employment from the pandemic though)"}]}
