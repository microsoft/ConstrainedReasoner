They came in, they go out.  And non too soon.  What a crock with their prices.  \nI went to the 5Points going out of business sale....states 10-to-30% off.  I only saw one section with 30% off---the vitamins.  Everything else was 10 to 20% off and hardly a bargain.  I could get items at Vons or Albertsons with coupons for much less.  Why don't they just mark items down 50-70% off and get the heck out of dodge, er, Santa Barbara and go back where they came from.

The employee's were great just very uncertain about the future and who the next owners were going to be. To have a company come take over change everything and then up and leave is unsettling to say the least."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-09-03 02:34:23", "review_text": "Face it, Ralphs downtown has its drawbacks. So, I thought I'd give this place a try despite the fierce Santa Barbara backlash.\n\nI was glad that I did. Plenty of parking, nice, clean store. If you buy right there are some decent bargains here. It's a different store, you have to shop differently too.\n\nCalifornia avos for a buck, good prices on the meat, got some marrow bones for the dogs for two bucks too!\n\nThe place and the employees deserve a break. Give them a chance.\n\nand no, I'm not a union rep or an employee."}]}
