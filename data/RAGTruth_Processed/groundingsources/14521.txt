Two for one pizzas?!  Are you kidding?  All I wanted was a simple pepperoni pizza just for me so for my second pizza I got a simple cheese and a side salad. They were hot and delicious. I ate two slices of the pepperoni on the drive home in the car!  I highly recommended this place. The guy working was friendly!  I will be back to try something else the next time!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 06:11:12", "review_text": "Pizza is good but I had the most bizarre encounter with one of the employees \n\nI picked up a pizza for me and a relative and just got out of work and took the pizzas to my car and started eating my pizza in the car outside the restaurant.\n\nThe worker comes outside walking very slowly to my car while I'm eating my pizza and asks are you okay? in a very serious tone.\n\nI nod yes perplexed why he would even come and ask me this and he laughs and walks away."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-16 04:19:06", "review_text": "Good pizza, not sure when they opened but the place was empty and I got my pizzas quick.
