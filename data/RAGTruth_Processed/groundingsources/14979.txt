They brought me out a cold sandwich on wonderbread, something I could have packed myself for lunch in 3rd grade. Ive heard there are other good hot sandwiches on the menu, but from what I saw this place served nothing but overpriced garbage."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-03-09 04:36:20", "review_text": "Great sandwiches, salads, and soups.  The staff are extremely friendly, and its just a really cool looking shop.  Good selection of drinks, chips, and other miscellaneous snacks.  If your going to order a sandwich, get The Julius with cranberry sauce.  Its only everything holy between two pieces of grilled sourdough."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2013-01-09 23:06:10", "review_text": "They have gluten free bread, but ask for it toasted.  The owner is gluten free, so the staff is better trained than most.  Try the beet salad with the curry crusted walnuts, it is really tasty.  The patio has a nice mountain view."}]}
