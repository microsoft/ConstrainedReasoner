First of all, way to use the Axxess card, Cafe 154! Many businesses are skimping out, but a full on free item with no purchase requirement is a great hook.\n\nI was planning on only getting the latte, but upon entering the cafe, I was confronted with a small case of high quality pastries. Immediately after I began gazing at the treats, a friendly woman came up and asked me if I had any questions about the pastries. I asked if she had any suggestions, and she smiled and sighed exaggeratedly as if to say what a hard choice it would be because they were all so good. She recommended the berry scone or the croissants. I was eyes a generously almond/powdered sugar encrusted croissant, and ordered that, along with a latte. The same woman asked if I'd like to add a syrup for the difference in price (deal was for only the regular latte). Normally I normally would decline, but this was \"homemade\" syrup, so I got the dark chocolate.\n\nBest latte and croissant I've had in Santa Barbara! The chocolate syrup was rich and perfectly sweet; the almond croissant was both heavily crusted and filled with almond paste, and not greasy like many croissants. So delicious!! I ended up paying $5 total\n\nGreat products, great staff, reasonable prices for a high quality cafe."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-12-30 18:23:01", "review_text": "Great place, food is outstanding and Bulletproof Coffee prepared perfectly.  lovely outdoor seating and super friendly staff.
