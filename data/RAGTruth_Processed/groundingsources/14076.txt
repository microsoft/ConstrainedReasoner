This place was recommended by a local and it did not disappoint.  Their deli sandwiches are awesome.  Great place to get snacks before you hit the lake or travel through to your next destination."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-06-18 16:39:36", "review_text": "I love this place and used to eat here all the time (along with my partner), but was recently diagnosed with Celiac (so I can't eat my favorite food, bread). I WISH they had gluten free bread; then I could get my usual breakfast sand again! :(( \n\nAside from that, great service and great food. Also love the little outdoor patio area; it's adorable and has plenty of benches and umbrellas for shade."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-02-10 18:44:46", "review_text": "It's all boarshead and fits all very delicious. I cook with Boarshead meats at home but I've never made sandwiches this good. I wasn't expecting this to be in the middle of an RV park but it was a very nice break from a very long road trip. I'll be back every single time I drive through this area."}]}
