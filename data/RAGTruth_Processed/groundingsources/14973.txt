This is hands down the best vegan and gluten free pizza ever. \n\nI get the vegan rice crust with the vegan mikonos cheese and add whatever toppings i like.

This place understands what people want from a pizza joint. Free ranch (pesto ranch if you know what's good) proves that they are for the people. \n\nPizza: good, but more importantly, cheap. Variety of slices available, and they heat the slices up before serving. Would recommend the Pesto slice. \n\nBeer: the IVPA jar is the best deal in Isla vista. Delicious brawn and a lot of bang for your buck. \n\nAtmosphere: everything you want from a casual pizza joint. Mix of Latin and pop music. Multiple tv's with sports on. Easy place to hang out in for an hour. I spent three hours here and it wasn't enough"}]}
