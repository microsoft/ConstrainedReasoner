The carne asada was a little dry, but overall it was yummy. Pork and chicken were my favorite! But I wouldn't say it is worth $2.50 per taco! I'd rather go to a taco truck to get cheaper tacos. \n\n-Service-\n10/10! The workers are very quick with preparing orders and the food comes out hot! \n\n-Looks-\nIt doesn't look like much outside, but it is way larger inside that expected. There are a ton of tables indoors and no tables outside. \n\n-Other-\nThere's plenty of free street parking wowing the area!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-12 06:24:59", "review_text": "Great street tacos at an affordable price. I had the chicken fajitas taco and it was super tasty and fresh. The meat was slow cooked with peppers and onions. The portion was enough for almost two tacos. I would next time try one of the grilled meat tacos. The only bummer is they don't offer chips. The salsa was spicy hot but good. I will return to try other tacos!"}]}
