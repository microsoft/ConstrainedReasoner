I've been wanting to eat here for several years based on what I thought was a great reputation in town.  I don't get over to the Mesa much but when I saw a coupon in a mailed flyer a couple months ago, I clipped it.  It offered a free entree with purchase of one entree and two drinks. Even with a discount of $12, the bill was $53 for lunch (before tip) -- I can eat a great dinner out for less than this -- so I was expecting a very delicious meal.  Both my companion and I felt the food was vastly overpriced for the quality, flavor and even presentation. The quantity was generous enough but the items we ordered (empanadas and the mushroom burger) were both rather bland.  The \"burger\" was served on a doughy, barely cooked pita-like bread rather than on an appropriate item to hold a messy burger in place like a brioche bun.  It was completely falling apart after a few bites... which would have been okay to eat with a fork except it was just not flavorful or complex given the list of ingredients. The most interesting item was the ketchup made from beets.  Also the side fries weren't thoroughly cooked except for the smallest ones.  Definitely not a $24 item! The empanadas were somewhat better but again, not a 'wow' and not even a 'hey, really tasty.' Just bland and again, not worth $24.  The half-off discount didn't even cover the $13 cost of a chai tea and lemonade (that was mostly ice of course).  All in all, very disappointing food and therefore completely overpriced.  We took the food to go so I cannot really comment on the service. When I read another lengthy review (12/5/21), I now see that the prices have been jacked and the quality has been wavering. I totally understand the precarious state of the restaurant business right now during covid but I cannot recommend this restaurant at this time."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-10 16:46:12", "review_text": "Flavors are always spot on! Service is also good. Best fusion snd vegan food in Santa Barbara."}]}
