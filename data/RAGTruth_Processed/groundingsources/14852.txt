They also sell Jarritos :)"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-05-23 09:33:21", "review_text": "Flavor and quality! I was raised on spanish food, so coming to IV was a struggle. This place is small and not well advertised (I've lived down the street from this place for three years and didn't even notice them). But man oh man, this place is awesome! Arguably my number one hispanic food joint out here. I've eaten at almost all the mexican places established in old town Goleta to IV to Downtown Santa Babara. This place is by far the most flavorful and bang for your buck. The gentleman who mans the cash register is always so kind. I salsas and condiments are fresh and delicious. Everything down to the vegetables in a vegetarian burrito is sooo tasty! I could eat their vegetable burrito everyday for the rest of my life. I am going to be eating here regularly from here on out."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-05-05 05:06:40", "review_text": "Second best burrito I've had in IV, didn't make me sick so that was a win, no pinto beans thank god. Overall delish"}]}
