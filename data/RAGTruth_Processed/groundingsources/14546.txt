I ordered a mild green curry with shrimp, which actually ended up being pretty spicy. They also left the tails on the shrimp. We ordered delivery through Restaurant Connection which was the only delivery option, and it took 1.5 hours and a dish was forgotten (not sure whether the fault or the restaurant or the delivery service) but we did get a refund after calling. Our friends did really enjoy the pork belly fried rice but the drunken noodles had a very high ratio of vegetables to noodles."}]}
