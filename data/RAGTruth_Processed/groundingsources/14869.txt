When I ask about it you say you will have it soon.... ok how does that help me right now. Lol. It doesn't. I'm a vegan  and lettuce is sort of a staple at times. Enough about me and on to the review. \n\nI had my bowl 89% done and the guy puts sour cream on it when I asked for guacamole. There was no way I could go with that because I don't drink or eat anything with milk  in it. So we had to start all over again. The guy was pretty cool about it and whizzed through and made another one .  It was good actually. \n\nThe site was kind of dark and had an ambience about it. It seated up to 71 people and was a cool setting on State Street."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-09-01 22:50:09", "review_text": "The food is great, as usual!\nThis chipotle is very clean.

The food was so salty I couldn't even eat it. I heard other customers saying the same thing. The manager is rude and was giving me dirty looks when I mentioned it."}]}
