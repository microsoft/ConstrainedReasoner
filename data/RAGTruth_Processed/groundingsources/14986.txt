OK, our bad, only so many seats and booths, no reservation. I had the broiled salmon. Fairly small piece, very thin, but tasty, offered with carrots, which I did not want, substituted cole slaw, which was good, Also served with home fries, which were good. Spouse had Beef Stroganov. Rated it 'OK' also served with carrots, not a fav. Two had corned beef and cabbage, rated it good, and took some home. One complained the cabbage wasn't properly done. Another had pork chops; tasted OK but were very thin, a little dry. \nDidn't get reports from the other table. In my view the food was OK, not memorable. My Salmon dinner was over-priced at $33. Heck of a better deal at Pepe's Mexican at $15.95, bigger piece of fish, Chile Relleno and with a better side and fruit salsa. And the carrots? No broccoli, no green beans just boiled carrots the only veggie?. \nThe only plus was a great server - sorry I didn't get her name."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2020-01-16 14:50:32", "review_text": "Traditional Coffee Shop, it looks like a Denny's and the food is comparable. A little on the bland and greasy side of the aisle. I ordered Cinnamon Raisin French Toast and hashbrowns.\n\nFrench Toast - came out flat and mushy.\nHashbrowns with cheese - greasy and only crisp on top.\n\nCoffee was good and service was pleasant. \n\nNot worth a stop in my opinion!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2020-01-03 19:29:28", "review_text": "Waitress is the only reason this place gets any stars! For 2 adults and a child it was $60! We could've gone to a steakhouse. The food was crap- soggy hashbrowns, chewy pancakes, watery coffee. Skip this place!"}]}
