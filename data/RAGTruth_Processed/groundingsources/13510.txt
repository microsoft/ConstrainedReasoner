$5.5M in Drugs Seized at Texas Border
It's been a bad couple of days (we are happy to report) for Cartel drug smugglers along the Texas - Mexico Border. The picture above is of a 400+ pound methamphetamine & Marijuana shipment seized by U.S. Customs & Border Protection Officer at the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso. The case has been turned over to the FBI and Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).
Meanwhile, DPS pilots and U.S. Border Patrol Agents on the ground joined forces to interrupt a drug-smuggling operation in the West Texas desert near Van Horn.
In Laredo, U.S. Border Patrol Agents took down a 275+ pound load of marijuana worth well over $400,000.
In Hidalgo, CBP Officers discovered a 100+ pound load of methamphetamine smugglers attempted to drive across an International Bridge into Texas worth $930,000.
In Eagle Pass, Texas U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) Officers took down a 40+ pound load of cocaine being smuggled into the state worth more than $500,000.
In all, that's more than 800 pounds of dope worth well over $1,435,400 seized crossing into Texas over the past few days.
When combined with several bales of cocaine that have washed ashore along the Padre Island National Seashore in recent days that's more than $5,735,000 worth of drugs Federal Agents have seized in Texas!
Do law officers have enough resources to deal with drug smugglers along the Texas Border?
