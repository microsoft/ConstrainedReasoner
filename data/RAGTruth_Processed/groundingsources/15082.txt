Twice, I came here to get takeouts for dinner, they were completely empty, yet places like Jack in the Box and Chipotle in the same shopping center get way more business with their boring food and sometimes highly processed food.  People of this city, you frustrate me.  I am just hoping that Pollofino doesn't close the same way as La Carreta."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-04-16 22:15:55", "review_text": "Adios La Carreta...it's closed."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2013-03-03 22:52:05", "review_text": "This place is amazing!!\n\nDelicious food (especially the carne asada plate and the chili verde), good service, and an all around good experience. Prices are very good too. \n\nThe owner, Rosie, is so helpful and nice. \n\nEvery time I go I leave happy. Definitely recommend"}]}
