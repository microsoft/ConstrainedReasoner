The staff is very busy on their phones showing each other things that make each other laugh. I always feel as if I'm interrupting  and just shouldn't be there. Good thing for me is there are half a dozen other Mexican restaurants in town!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-08 03:37:01", "review_text": "I was hesitant ordering from here due to the low rating and poor reviews. However, I'm the type of person that needs to try before bashing a restaurant. I probably tried almost the entire menu with the exception of the burgers. The crispy tacos are good but I would stick to beef the chicken was a bit dry, however still very good full of cheese, salsa, and lettuce in a crispy shell with juicy meat mmmm just yummy. The potato, beef and chicken taquitos were sooo good too. With lots of guac, cheese and salad. The taquitos were my favorite. My husband was hooked on their chille relleno burrito, and let me tell you it didn't disappoint. As for dislikes I would have to say their tacos. The chicken \"street taco\" was to dry and tasteless under seasoned. As were the beef and carnitas. Just not well prepared they need a little more love. They have the best salsas and best guacamole. The chip salsa was my favorite. The rice and beans are good too. Anyways the place is good I recommend it."}]}
