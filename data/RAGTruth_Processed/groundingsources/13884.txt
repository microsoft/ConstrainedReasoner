Michigan Jewish Groups Prepare for Palestinian Protests
Jewish groups and communities across Michigan are on high alert after a former high ranking Hamas member called for Muslims to protest in support of Palestine.
Recently, Hamas attacked Israel leaving more than a thousand people dead, including American citizens. Dozens were also taken hostage.
Israel has since locked down the Gaza Strip and began retaliatory strikes.
In response, former Hamas chief Khalid Meshaal has called for protests to support the Palestinians trapped in the Gaza Strip.
Israel has occupied the area for 17 years and has shut off all food, water, and electricity. Currently, 2.3 million Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip. The Gaza Strip is ruled by Hamas, a Islamic terrorist organization.
