Been coming here for past 50+ years.  Disappointed.  The order was quite a long time in coming.  No one came by to refresh our drinks.  Asked for water three times.  Had to call the waiter about the delay...the table next to us arrived later but served before us.  My friend's fish and chips was fine, good.  My sister's lobster was good.  She ordered a small salad and they brought a huge salad, but did not charge us for it, because we argued with the waitress saying we couldn't believe that was a side salad.  They later came by saying they're a new kitchen crew that wasn't up to speed, yet.  They didn't charge us for it.  The restraint was only 1/2 full, so there was no reason for the foul-up.  I ordered ice tea but they only had the passion fruit sweet tea.  I ordered the rack of lamb, which was cooked just right, tasted very good, but was the toughest lamb I've ever had, stringy sinuous.  They opened the front door and a cold draft came into our area, making us want to leave immediately.  We were going to get doggie bags but it was too cold.  Not good.  I hope they read this.  We will be back, but another performance like that will lose them local customers, that take guests out to dinner..."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-21 22:04:34", "review_text": "Juan and Miguel have always made our days. We usually  go to brunch on the weekends for their wonderful entrees, bottomless minmosas  and amazing service. Thank you Juan and Miguel! We always leave with a smile on our faces."}]}
