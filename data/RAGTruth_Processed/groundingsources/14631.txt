The other lady had waited an hour plus, granted it was Friday but still this place was the slowest rustys ever. Also they forgot my wings and I waited an extra 20 mins for those so total was 65 mins for my order. Only to get raw chicken wings snd and a cold pizza"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-30 05:51:39", "review_text": "Popped by late night on the way back to Los Angeles from Santa Barbara.
