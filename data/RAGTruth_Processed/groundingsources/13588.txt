'Young and the Restless' Spoilers: Greg Rikaart & Judith Chapman Return, Gloria And Kevin Come Home
The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers tease that Greg Rikaart and Judith Chapman will return to the CBS soap opera in the coming weeks. The Young and the Restless' official Instagram page shared the news with the viewers.
She Knows Soaps reports that Michael Baldwin (Christian Leblanc) hasn't been seen on the show for several months. He represented Diane Jenkins (Susan Walters) after Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) faked her death. Once Phyllis revealed herself alive, she expected Michael to represent her. But he had to leave town after his mom, Gloria Bardwell (Judith Chapman), had some legal entanglement in Singapore.
As for Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), he was last in Genoa City when Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E Bregman) accepted a lifetime achievement award in fashion. He was only on the show for one episode. Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Henderickson) mentions Kevin often in conversations. He is busy working in town. It is a nice touch for the holidays to reunite the Fisher/Baldwin family for a celebration.
The Young and the Restless fans can count on drama to pop up with Gloria. She's good at stirring the drama up to the highest notch possible. She could be dealing with legal issues, which could upset Michael.
Gloria and Kevin's appearances should air around Thanksgiving. They are expected to only air in an episode or two, as Rikaart is currently on Days of Our Lives full-time.
