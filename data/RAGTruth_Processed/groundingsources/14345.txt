{"question": "what is the difference in AF-C and AF-A", "passages": "passage 1:AF-S is AF 'single'- your camera will focus on a fixed object when you press the AF button and will remain focused on that point for as long as you hold the button down.This is best for static subjects.AF-C is AF 'continuous' - the camera will focus on whatever is in the relevant AF points (depending on how you have your AF coverage set up) and will attempt to keep the subject in focus wherever it moves, whether that's towards/away from the camera or laterally.F-A is AF 'auto' and automatically switches between the two AF modes depending on what the subject is doing. This requires less effort on the part of the photographer, but you are relying on the camera guessing correctly what you are focussing on, and may result in unexpected focus.\n\npassage 2:up vote 16 down vote accepted. AF-C (AF-continuous or servo mode) is used for photographing moving subjects. AF-S means single shot and is used for subject that is stationary. AF-A is where the camera decides whether the subject is moving or not and tries to alternate between the servo and single shot mode accordingly.dd a comment |. up vote 5 down vote. There is another important difference between AF-S and AF-C. With AF-S, you cannot take a shot without focus being locked (green light being on). With AF-C you will take a shot anytime the shutter release is pressed.\n\npassage 3:AF-C is continuous, when you focus on an object, holding it (half-)pressed, it will continue to try to keep whatever is in the focus areas in focus, whether you move or the subject moves, or you move the focus area to another subject.F-S is single, when you focus on one object and hold it (half-)pressed, it will keep the focus where it locked. This includes any movement of you/camera, and the movement of the subject. This is used for recomposing (once you lock focus, you can rotate the camera and the object will stay in focus).\n\n"}
