She and her fiance really wanted to be married and so, they decided to have a simple private wedding on the lawn of the Santa Barbara Courthouse with dinner afterwards at Opal restaurant. Only the my daughter, her fiance, my husband, our other daughter and our grandchildren were there. I wanted to do something to help make this day memorable and special for them. I reached out to Richard, owner and event coordinator of Opal. Over a few weeks and with many emails between us, Richard and I put together what was simply the best mini reception the newlyweds could have had and, somehow we managed to keep it a secret.\nFrom suggestions for appetizers, to working out details of timing, to having his staff find a way to separate us from the other diners in their cozy and comfortable parklet (the restaurant was packed) and set a beautiful table with a floral centerpiece and rose petals I provided, Richard showed great understanding and appreciation of what I was trying to accomplish. He's a truly kind and caring man. To top it all off, the food was spectacular! The service was outstanding! I would recommend Opal Restaurant highly for any special event and absolutely for a lovely and delicious dinner."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-16 16:21:24", "review_text": "Went here before a show at the theater next door. We said we were seeing a show in an hour. Ordered food and it was coming out a few minutes later. Great food, great service, great outdoor seating!!"}]}
