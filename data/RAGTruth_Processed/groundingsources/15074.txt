I have been here several times for my birthday, a time or two for a family event: birthdays, baptisms, anniversaries. You get the picture.\nSo when i was invited to a friends bd dinner at the Tee Off, i jumped at the chance.\nI/We always start with drinks and Schrooms though i think that the Tee has changed the presentation of these. But: the schroomers are still my favorite among all of the sauteed mushrooms i have eaten all over the world. Yes right here in Loud family SB!\nService wise: the Tee Off has always been dependent on whether the very experienced wait staff is having a good night or not. Yet the service has always been professional if it has not always been friendly or personal.\nI think that this is the major issue about the Tee Off and has always been.\nThe Ladies of the Tee Off tend to as a general rule segregate their tables into categories: the tourists, the veterans, the others.\nI have gotten great, personal service here and ok efficient service from a couple of servers.\nBut: i am smart enough to ignore any bs and just enjoy the company that i am with as well as the good to great food they serve here.\nWe started at the Bar and i have to say that the bartenders (Matt) here have always been friendly, enthusiastic and personal. Martinis and garlic bread? Yes!\nWe started with the famous Tee Off's plate of saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms and they are delicious as always: chocked full of big fat small creminis', wine, veal demi-glace . Always delicious and they never change.\nWe all ordered Prime Rib and shared the large cut, med rare. It arrived exactly as ordered with a big fat Baked Potato plus sour dough rolls. We both had a salad with Blue cheese. The greens are crisp and cold and the dressing is jammed packed with real blue cheese chunks. The Tee Off does not skimp on the accoutrements or the primary entrees, appetizers or desserts as well as the drinks. Oh, the drinks! Heavy pours are the going thing here and have always been as far as i know.\nThe food here is and has always been first rate: prime for the Beef and top choice for the pork and chicken. This is food that you can write home about.\nThe Chef in charge has his foot and hand on all that goes out to the customer and the final products show this firm grip.\nThe Tee Off bar opens at 4 with the restaurant at 5 most days.\nWe arrived early, had drinks and then the food at a booth in front. Though for me either dining room is a good place to people watch.\nYou can make reservations if you like.\nWe had a primo time here and the server was friendly and pleasant and more to the point, efficient.\nCheers to the Tee Off and Happy New Year."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-25 20:48:45", "review_text": "Always my favorite spot in Santa Barbara for prime rib and clam chowder.
