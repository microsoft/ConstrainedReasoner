Went to Super Cucas on the Mesa today. Wow- what a stark contrast. Rudy's now charges $6+ for one taco, which is mostly filled with shredded lettuce. Super Cucas charges $6.95 for (3) tacos. Same with burritos. For bean, rice and cheese burrito, Rudy's charges $10.95 and for same burrito, Super Cucas charges $7. Rudy's is stingy with salsa, they don't want to give you more than two. Super Cucas will give you as much as you want, all with a friendly smile. Which leads me to the last thing- we have found the staff at Rudy's to be unfriendly, no smiles. Super Cucas is the opposite, with a friendly greeting, and a \"nothing is too much trouble\" attitude. Lesson learned. Don't go to Rudy's, go to Super Cucas!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 21:34:34", "review_text": "This place has really authentic Mexican food. When you come here, prepare to be full because not only is the food amazing, they give you such generous portions too. We were driving home to Riverside and passing through Santa Barbara. My cousin had a hankering for tacos so I start looking for taco shops. It was New Year's Eve and not many places were open. Rudy's came up as having really good crispy tacos so we went there. We had tried to go to another place but being that it was Santa Barbara, the place had no parking and the street parking was full so we tried Rudy's which came up with good reviews and on site parking. I ordered chicken crispy tacos with rice and beans. My cousin ordered street style tacos. Our food came with complimentary chips and salsa. They have a salsa bar with Pico de Gallo, mild salsa, spicy salsa, salsa verde & guacamole salsa. My tacos came LOADED & I mean stuffed full of delicious shredded chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese and on the side came onions & cilantro. My cousin's tacos were stuffed as well with handmade delicious corn tortillas. The beans were delicious and so was the rice. The chips are homemade out of the tortillas and were hot and crispy. I loved this food! So good and we came out fat & happy. Great local place. No frills just great food. They have limited outdoor seating and they also do orders to go & indoor dining. Definitely going to hit this spot again when we go up the coast! Reasonable prices and great food."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-05 20:25:45", "review_text": "When they get your order right, it's decent Mexican food. But that's not my main issue. \n\nTwo years in a row I have come in a few times a couple weeks before Christmas for gift cards and this location NEVER has them. I am not a business genius but I've ran multiple restaurants in my life and I know gift card sales are the lifeblood of a restaurant during this time of year. This location has got to get it together. This year, my $100 in gift card purchases are going to Los Agaves."}]}
