Unassuming Exterior surrounded with residential and light commercial. I confess that I came for the fire-roasted artichoke and my guy wanted the French dip. The artichoke tasted way better than it looked. It was still smoking when it was served. It came with an aioli and melted butter. Both were great. The French dip also tasted better than it looked - very tender shaved beef with a tasty and not too salty au jus. No pix because the lighting was poor and both items tasted better than they looked. I would definitely go back for more. There were several great sounding entree items and appetizers...a broader menu than one might expect at a beer joint. Good job, Brewhouse!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-27 01:47:28", "review_text": "Excellent first stop we made in Santa Barbara.  This is more of a local pub than a fancy restaurant.  Upon walking in, we noticed the adorable house doggy walking around greeting guests.  We were sat quickly and ordered a couple of their house beers.  Yes, they do have great craft beer selection.  We ordered the salmon sandwich and the grilled chicken sandwich, both were good portions and tasted pretty good.  The only reason for the 1 star off is that the salmon sandwich was dripping a little too much grease/oil, but the flavor overall was good.  Nice attentive servers as well."}]}
