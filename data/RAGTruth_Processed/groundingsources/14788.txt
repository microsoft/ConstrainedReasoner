I have been to wanting to try this restaurant because I have heard good things about their food. I got two carnitas tacos, red steak enchiladas and a Michelada to go. Everything was tasty and flavorful! The steak enchiladas was wet with the red sauce and came with rice and beans. I don't usually eat beans, but their beans had a good taste and wasn't dry at all. The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because they could have put more meat on the tacos and inside the enchiladas. Other than that everything was great and the michelada was definitely refreshing!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-21 01:01:38", "review_text": "Most delicious bbq chicken in town... under radar spot for locals. On Saturdays only they grill some delicious marinated chicken. Order a half plate comes with hand made tortillas and chow down. Just melts in mouth so tasty, flavorful and fluffy. Their tacos are also really tasty during the week. Very nice staff, a real locals joint no tourists here. Maybe one of very best Mexican spots around Milpas which is saying a lot. Forget chicken ranch too much sodium aka heart attack 101. This is healthy and extremely tasty. Seasoning perfection."}]}
