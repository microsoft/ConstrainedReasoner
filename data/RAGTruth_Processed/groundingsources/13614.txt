We've had almost everything on the menu and have enjoyed every bite. There's no doubt about it that Taffy's is our favorite pizza in town, but we also love the great beer selection, bread sticks, salads, pastas and sandwiches. \n\nThey have a HUGE selection of pizza breads, veggies toppings, cheeses and meats. Because they have such a variety of toppings, their sandwiches, salads, etc. have a great selection of toppings too. I called and accidentally asked to order an antipasto salad, not realizing that they don't even have an antipasto salad on the menu. However, they have such amazing customer service, that they assured me they have everything to make a great antipasto salad delivered to my house. And they were right!! It was incredible. \n\nAND free delivery, but call early to place your order. It can take a little while depending on when you call. So worth it for free delivery!! \n\nPre-Covid times, they offered fun events like trivia on their large, private outdoor patio. I hope they can start that up again soon. \n\nThey also have a small arcade room and lots of children's books scattered here and there for the kiddos. Very family friendly!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-26 20:28:31", "review_text": "Fantastic pizza. Have been coming to taffy's for 20 years since I was a teenager and now bringing my kids here. Love it. Good food at reasonable price.
