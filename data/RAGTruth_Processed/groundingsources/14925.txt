It's totally worth the trip!\n\nCharming space, inside and out. The wines are very good. Tastings are a bit lofty, pricewise, but they are a treat in the space with nice, chill music. Outdoor space has heaters and a nice firepit.  \n\nDefinitely recommend this stop."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-13 22:38:54", "review_text": "$25 for their Standard tasting (a 5 pour flight) and $35 for the Specialty tasting (also, a 5 pour flight). They waive the tasting fee with a 3 bottle or more purchase and offer $1 ground shipping on 6 or more bottles.\n\nWe've been to Carr Winery three times in the past year and have had wonderful experiences each visit. It's located in an industrial area just outside of downtown Santa Barbara. The building is a Quonset hut style structure, which houses the tasting and barrel room. Just outside, along the street, is a beautiful little patio which is perfect for your tasting adventure. While we enjoy the inside tasting room, the patio has a cabana setup with comfy booths, covered tables, heaters, and string lighting for the ambiance.\n\nOn this latest visit (1/8/22), Ana poured for us and was an absolute joy. She told us that she recently moved down to SB from the Napa area and she was a wealth of knowledge about Carr's wines, as well as the wine industry in general. We'll definitely seek her out again on our next visit. We shared a Standard and Specialty tasting, as well as purchased a bottle of the 2015 Late Harvest Viognier, a sweet dessert wine that my Mother-in-Law loves (as do we). You can also purchase wine by the glass, and they have cheese boards and other snacks for sale. I always state in my reviews that wine tasting is subjective, but we love just about everything we taste at Carr and quite a few bottles made their way home with us.\n\nThe atmosphere at Carr is comfortable and welcoming. It's a very popular tasting spot, so it's best if you plan ahead and make reservations. I highly recommend you stop by Carr Winery on your next visit to Santa Barbara. Maybe we'll see you there!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-26 07:27:32", "review_text": "This tasting room is adorbs! I really love their whole outdoor tasting setup. It's so chic and dreamy. They've got such a cute little cabana setup with comfy booths and long white curtain drapes for privacy. Just about all of their picnic tables are covered, and they have heat lamps and string lights meticulously placed. \n\nTastings at Carr Winery are by reservation only. I was able to easily schedule a tasting online before my visit. When I arrived, I was seated at my table right away and given a tasting menu. Jackie hosted me in the tasting room and she was wonderful! Very knowledgeable, sweet, and eager to tell me about each wine that she poured. Tastings are $20 for 5 tastes off of their current tasting menu, and the fee is waived with 3 or more bottle purchases. You can also purchase wine by the glass, and they have snacks and cheese boards for sale.\n\nTheir standard tasting included a taste of 1 white wine, 1 Ros\u00e9, and 3 of their reds. I personally preferred their red wines more than their white and Ros\u00e9. Their Pinot Gris was definitely a lot different than what I'm used to. It was very minerally and acidic which is different for me, but it wasn't bad. Their Pinot Noir was wonderful though. Very earthy but balanced. I also enjoyed their Syrah which was lightly tannic but not super bold. Their red wines definitely shine here.\n\nThe atmosphere is super chill and comfortable. It seems like this is a popular spot in town for group hangouts and tastings. I'm still dabbling in wines that are from the Santa Barbara/Santa Rita Hills wine region, so this added some good exposure for me. Really enjoyed my tasting experience and wouldn't mind coming back for another visit."}]}
