Views are the only reason to give it a second star. \n\nParking: must park within a pod parking lot at the hotel. Walking distance from parking lot is very reasonable. \n\nHostess: was greeted right away and she was friendly. \n\nService: very lacking in service. Our server took approx 10 minutes before she even acknowledged us. Walking past our table multiple times, and never said a thing. Throughout the experience, she came to the table one other time to check on us. She messed up our order on the chilaquiles and didn't take off the chorizo. My wife doesn't eat pork and this made her sick, even though she tried to eat around it. My order was to have toast with my meal and i got fruits initially. Silverware and glasses came out with food stuck to them. How hard is it to take some pride in your work? \n\nFood: I had eggs Benedict, and they were okay. My wife had chilaquilles and she didn't get to eat most of it, because the server screwed up the order. Instead she ate my toast. \n\nPricing: typical hotel restaurant pricing, but on the higher side compared to a regular restaurant."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-06-01 00:49:12", "review_text": "Food was ok.  Had Eggs Benedict the muffin felt like it had been dipped in butter and the ham was thick which made it difficult to cut.  \nThe service was not great, sat and ordered and 20 minutes later another server came to take my order again?"}]}
