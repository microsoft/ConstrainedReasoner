While typing in the confirmation information, I got a refund on my credit card and was told my reservation was canceled.  Got an email from the management explaining it was due to \"circumstances beyond their control\".  I asked if they were going out of business but was told no.  He did give me a reservation at Monarch.  All disappointing as I had booked a month before and it was for August 31, our 35th wedding anniversary.  They don't appear to be taking reservations.  Hope this gets resolved as we would still like to experience it."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-07-27 16:26:25", "review_text": "This is an experience! First off I want to thank the chefs for being so open and comfortable, it definitely made the experience feel like a super fancy hangout more than an expensive private stuffy dinner.\n\nThere are no bad dishes here. I was trying to think if there was a dish I didn't like and I cannot think of any. The only tiny thing I noticed was that the wagyu did not cut as smoothly as previous wagyu I've had which was interesting to me. I was surprised that it didn't quite melt in your mouth. The dish was still amazing and I can't say anything bad about anything else I tried. I can go into detail about every dish but it's easier if you just try the food and then you'll know.\n\nAll the alcoholic pairings were amazing! And I kind of wanted to try the non alcoholic pairings more as they sounded very enticing.\n\nThe pricing seems excessive but it includes EVERYTHING! Parking, gratuity, drink pairings, taxes. You don't worry about anything except having a good time. They're not shy about the pours either and there's no limit to them. Once you take this into account, the price is very reasonable. It also may seem like small bites but I was very satisfied at the end. I don't say full because that typically means I overate. Let's just say I wasn't hungry at the end.\n\nQuality ingredients, amazing pairings, and 3 friendly and very talented chefs made for an amazing experience. I highly recommend trying the silver bough!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-05-23 05:09:42", "review_text": "The food is absolutely wonderful as you'd expect for a dinner at this price point.  Each course, and there's 18 of them, is well thought out to the minor detail.  The 18 courses are split into three major sections, of sea, land and desert.  Each plate is thoroughly explained by one of the three chefs.\n\nChalk up another huge success for Chef Phillip Lee and the Scratch Family of Restaurants, which includes, SushiBar (LA and Montecito), Woodley Proper, ScratchBar and The Monarch)."}]}
