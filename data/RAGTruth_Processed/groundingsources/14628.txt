They have a solid line-up, with pulled pork, brisket and chicken. My fav is the grilled cheese with bacon, simple but solid :-) They are also very accommodating  about doing lo-carb dishes. Can't go wrong with Georgia's  :-)"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-04-08 06:31:52", "review_text": "Shame on you if you like this place. There are other good BBQ catering companies with in range. I bet the new Dickies BBQ will be 100% better than this sh@t. Sorry but this is some nasty food. Don't be fooled you will regret every penny spent, I know I did."}]}
