Can we get enough people to commit to spend $100.00 a month in purchases to keep it open? I will! We all have to eat, and why not get great food? I neglected to support them with take out until recently, my mistake. If we can get a 1,000 people in Santa Barbara to commit to spending something every month, will that be enough?\n\nDave are you listening? We need to keep Beachside open. The wounds of losing Jaspers are still sore, we cannot lose Beachside too!\n\nSocial media geeks please get on this. Let's spread the word.\n \nCome on Santa Barbara, we are better than this! Let's all save Beachside!\n\nA 35 year fan"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-01-17 01:41:17", "review_text": "Can't say enough about the meal we had delivered right to our truck!! After a gorgeous day of jet skiing, we decided we were too tired to cook! Pulled up to the beachside and ordered King crab veggies and salad being that were on a keto program it fit the bill!! They brought it right out to our truck hot and fresh!! Salads were premixed awesome!!! Crab was fresh and sweet! Veggies were perfectly cooked!! Thank you Beachside and Carlos for ending our day on a super high note!!!!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-01-11 07:11:35", "review_text": "Stopped here on recommendation of a friend, and to get their Key Lime Pie.  It was a little awkward doing the take-out order for a few reasons.  You had to walk up a ramp to place your order, and the ramp is long enough for 2 people/parties to stand on it at the same time, but it's not wide enough to walk past the person behind you after you've ordered without getting really close to them.  NOT easy to maintain good social distancing.  \n\nThe staff was friendly but overall it felt like the place was really understaffed.  It took a long time for someone to just come and take our order.  They had a dessert menu but it wasn't posted anywhere (though the regular menu was visible in 4+ locations).  So it took time for someone to come help us, it didn't take long for them to find the dessert menu but it would have been faster for me to order if I'd been able to see it before I got to the order point.  Anyway finally did get my order placed, finally paid for and signed for and it did arrive.  \n\nOverall process took too long to get a slice of pie, but the pie was very good.  SUPER tart so be aware of that.  Default comes with chopped almonds on top and some strawberry(?) sauce drizzled under it.  Also some whipped cream.  Hubby liked how tart it was (and he's very picky about this) but he doesn't like almonds or the strawberry sauce so he was bummed by the unexpected fanciness.  It's okay because now we know how we'll order it next time.  :)  I do expect to return.  \n\nI'll be happier when it's safe to dine in as this place has a big patio with a gorgeous view of the ocean."}]}
