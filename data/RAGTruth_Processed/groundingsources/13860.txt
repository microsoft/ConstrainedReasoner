Ravens Appear to Be Landing Spot for Derrick Henry
The Baltimore Ravens appear to be se tot make a big move ahead of the NFL Trade deadline on Tuesday, with the running game the target.
With the Tennessee Titans seemingly embracing a much needed rebuild, kicked off by the decision to start Will Levis as Ryan Tannehill is injured and the trading of long-time safety and team captain Kevin Byard, it appears that the Titans may be sellers at the deadline.
A number of NFL journalists, sports content creators, and analysts have already been speculating that the Titans may be very busy at the deadline, but now it appears that one of their biggest names will likely be changing jerseys next week.
That player is Titans running back Derrick Henry, who has long been one of the best running backs in the league, despite having a down season in 2023, compared to his production in prior seasons.
Henry had been rumored to be available during the offseason, so trading him next week wouldn't come as a complete shock, and it appears that two teams are considered to be leading the pack when it comes to landing Henry.
The Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns already have a storied rivalry, and they appear set to battle it out for Henry in the coming days.
However, it appears that the Ravens have the inside track.
Baltimore, which has a Top 5 rushing offense in the NFL, has had to rely on quarterback Lamar Jackson for the bulk of their rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, and without Jackson's contributions the Ravens would drop out of the Top 10 in rushing.
The Ravens are also without running back J.K. Dobbins who suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in the season opener, leaving the team to rely on the likes of Gus Edwards and Justive Hill, along with Melvin Gordon.
The leads to the Ravens having interest in Henry, and likely being the most aggressive in landing him.
Regardless of where he lands, it appears likely that Henry will be on the move next week.
