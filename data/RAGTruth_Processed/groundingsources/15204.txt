{"question": "what's the difference between kindle paperwhite kindle voyager", "passages": "passage 1:The Kindle Voyage has the best screen, with a 300 pixels-per-inch resolution. The more pixels smooshed into an inch of screen, the better everything looks. The Kindle Paperwhite smooshes 212 pixels into an inch; the standard Kindle smooshes 167 pixels into an inch.\n\npassage 2:Screen: The Kindle Voyage has a higher resolution screen (1448\u00d71072 vs 1024\u00d7758 for the Paperwhite). The pixel per inch difference is 300 vs 212. This equates to darker text on the Kindle Voyage, and makes fine details and text appear slightly clearer and sharper. Both use the newer Carta screen tech.\n\npassage 3:Price: One of the biggest differences between the two is the price. The Kindle Voyage starts at $199 for the model with ads, and it goes all the way up to $289 for 3G and no ads. The Kindle Paperwhite starts at $119 with ads and $139 without. Then it\u2019s $70 more for each 3G model.\n\n"}
