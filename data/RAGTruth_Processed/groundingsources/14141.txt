It was the only thing open at 9:00 pm in IV and I'm glad it was. My family lives out of the area and they had no idea they would be adopting a foodie for the holidays. They were very quiet and sweet. The server was so inviting and friendly. She ate at an adjacent table because they were about to close but they insisted that sit in the warm and eat slow so I could savor and enjoy my sushi and teriyaki chicken. The rolls were amazing and the teriyaki chicken came out sizzling on the iron plate. The smiles were the best. This is a great little spot. They make you feel like family. Highly recommend."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2019-01-07 22:38:27", "review_text": "I tried this place when it first opened. This review is for their ramen. Don't get it! Ever! It was terrible to say the least. The most important thing in ramen is the broth and what they gave me was literally just cloudy water. It was tasteless (you can see in the picture for yourself). It was the most horrible bowl of noodles I've ever had. Despite this, I was considering going back a second time to maybe try their sushi, but based on all the negative reviews here I change my mind. If you're planning on trying this place, just go to Sushiya nearby it's a lot better."}]}
