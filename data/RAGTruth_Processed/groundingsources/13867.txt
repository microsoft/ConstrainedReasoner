S.C. State Parks offers free admission to all 47 parks on Black Friday
The South Carolina State Parks department has announced that it's offering free admission to all of the 47 state parks in the Palmetto State on Black Friday, November 24th, to encourage everybody to #OptOutside for the day and enjoy one of our many beautiful parks.
Admission will be free at state parks in South Carolina on Black Friday as the Park Service joins the national #OptOutside initiative. The promotion encourages people to spend some time in the great outdoors the day after Thanksgiving.
After all, we might need some exercise after all that turkey and grandma's pecan pie.
From the mountains of the Upstate to the beaches along the coast and the sea islands of the Lowcountry, there's a state park for just about everyone. Discover stunning forested mountains and towering waterfalls, blackwater rivers and scenic inland lakes, white sand beaches and ancient inland shores, treasured American historic sites and priceless cultural treasures.
Locally in Beaufort, SC, Hunting Island State Park will be open with free admission from 6am to 6pm.
What a great opportunity to show off one of South Carolina's local parks to your visiting friends and family while they are visiting from out of town for Thanksgiving.
“Enjoy some time in our parks, on us,” an SC State Parks release said. Visitors to the parks are encouraged to post pictures to social media using the hashtags #OptOutside and #OptOutsideSC.
SC State Parks will not be offering their traditional Black Friday specials this year. Instead, they’re participating in the #OptOutside Initiative.
