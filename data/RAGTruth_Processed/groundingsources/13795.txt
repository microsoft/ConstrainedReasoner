While waiting for our pizza I witnessed some unsupervised children playing in the salad bar (while their negligent mother was chatting on the phone not paying attention)while her daughter was playing with the lettuce. As i watched her play around I see her throw salad back into the salad bar with her bare hands. I mentioned it to a hispanic employee with a long braided pony tail but she acted as if she didn't understand. I let her know that maybe they might want to put new salad at the salad bar but she did nothing. Eat at this location at your own RISK."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2016-02-05 23:24:32", "review_text": "I came here for lunch today with my co-worker to check out the new location and I must say it's pretty spacious inside! As soon as you walk in the door you are hit with that new smell of paint, carpet, and furniture. And then there's the smell of pizza! What a combo of scents going on lol.\n\nHow does this Rusty's compare to the old location down the road? Well it is very nice and spacious but the whole floor layout is kind of weird to me. Maybe it just needs to be broken in, but it's hard to explain unless you pay them a visit and see for yourself. Just a weird feeling overall when you're inside and not comfortable.\n\nAs for my food, I ordered my usual the \"Rusty's Quick Lunch\" special which comes with a small individual sized pizza with two toppings, small salad (one trip only salad bar), and a drink. All for only $7.51 can't beat that price!\n\nI was excited to build my salad since this location has a bigger salad bar with lots more toppings being offered such as sliced red bell peppers, cranberries, arugula, kale, corn, peas, and a bunch of other toppings. \n\nBUT! Let me just say getting the toppings was quite a task. This whole salad bar is HORRIBLE!!! The glass is totally in the way and the reach is ridiculous. Even the staff had trouble re-filling the salad bar. You have to lean sideways and reach your arm out just to get to the toppings in the middle. Totally not ergonomic friendly! I really hope they take out the glass. Hence the 3 stars!\n\nRusty's pizza in my opinion is 5 stars all the way! But this location needs a little bit more work on the floor plan and salad bar."}]}
