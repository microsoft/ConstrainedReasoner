I threw.all but 1 away.   The chocolate old fashioned was so dry I couldn't even get thru one bite.   I get that there is so much less traffic.   But then make less at a time and make them again in the afternoon.   The maple  buttermilk bar weighed a ton and again was so dry.  Usually the apple fritter can save the day... but no go, unfortunately.  Of the six I bought the only one I was able to eat was the chocolate crueller.\n\nI will say the girl who helped me was very friendly and was wearing a mask and washed her hands. So at least there's that!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2020-02-23 12:53:40", "review_text": "The donuts were okay and the store was not the cleanest. The customer service was good nothing special but it wasn't bad customer service. But overall it was a okay experience"}]}
