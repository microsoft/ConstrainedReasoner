One was a blue pomegranate and it was made short even after using the spatula to pour any excess smoothie into the cup.

This is not the first time this has happened, it seems to be a reoccurring problem."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-09-21 16:07:13", "review_text": "The blenders in montecito last night I go to the register the girl working it goes to it too and just blankly stares at me.\n\nNo hello what can I get you no acknowledgment or greeting.

The fruit juice they add tastes like corn syrup and sugar, maybe 10% real juice.\nI dont even think their wheat grass is organic as nothing is labeled organic and non gmo. Hit or miss on customer service and sanitary procedures as it looks as the college kids working their are trying to make them as fast as they can and rarely even blend them long enough, I was loyal but the last straw was when I bought a peanut butter bar and it tasted like moldy peanuts as I looked at the expiration date, it was 3 months expired! The owners have lost touch and the managers are not into customer service. So long..."}]}
