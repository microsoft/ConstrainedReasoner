'Bold and the Beautiful' Spoilers: Jacqueline MacInnes Wood Returns, Steffy Confesses Liam Kisses?
The Bold and the Beautiful (B&B) spoilers tease that Jacqueline MacInnes Wood will return as Steffy Forrester during the week of October 30. Several weeks ago, Jacqueline revealed that she had filmed new scenes, reassuring the fans that she would be back on the show in a few weeks.
Celeb Dirty Laundry reports that Wood's exact return date has not been revealed yet, but it should be available soon. The show hasn't been the same without her, so it will be great to have her return to the show.
Since Steffy's departure to Europe, Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) made their relationship official and got engaged. This news will stun Steffy, as she will worry about what that could mean for her and the children's safety.
The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say that Steffy is counting on John 'Finn' Finnegan (Tanner Novlan) to get rid of Sheila once and for all. But Deacon's surprise engagement complicates that plan. It will be challenging to convince Sheila to skip town and leave Deacon behind.
It's only a matter of time before the Forrester family learns about Eric Forrester's (John McCook) health crisis. B&B spoilers say that Eric could collapse during the fashion show. RJ Forrester (Joshua Hoffman) has kept his granddad's secret about his failing health, but soon, the scoop will be out.
The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say that Liam Spencer's (Scott Clifton) inappropriate kisses with Steffy will come out. Finn will learn about Liam's behavior, causing more tension between them.
