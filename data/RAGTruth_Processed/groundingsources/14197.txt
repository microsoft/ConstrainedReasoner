This is a quirky place, fresh ingredients, surprising spice blends, nimble combining of flavor profiles and interesting choices in service order.\nWe were a party of four, and granted we ordered weirdly, apps for dinner and changed up an order to four tacos from three as listed on the menu. Our meal came out not in order. One app came out, then salads, then mains and the four tacos app.\nIt was a tad slow. So let the impatient go elsewhere, but let the culinarily curious come and be delighted.\nI felt like I was back in San Miguel de Allende while enjoying this wonderful dinner with friends. The service was friendly, the art cool, the wine we had was way better that the price would suggest.\nMay Mundo's stay for many years. I have more friends to catch up with in this welcoming, easy to converse in and delicious restaurant."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-04-22 01:17:31", "review_text": "Wonderful family owned business! Would definitely recommend the gluten free rice noodles."}]}
