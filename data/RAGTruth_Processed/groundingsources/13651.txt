We were greeted immediately and seated very quickly. We had the classic eggs Benedict with hash browns and it was delicious! The waffles were tasty. The pancakes were a bit different, they tasted as if they were made with a sourdough batter? I could be wrong but regardless the food was really good. 10/10 would recommend. Oh, the coffee is delicious, a real cup of Joe!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-02 16:51:01", "review_text": "Nothing to write home about. Good diner food - pancakes, eggs, etc. but ambiance was meh. The main stand out was how great the service was."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 00:57:47", "review_text": "Made a return visit to Santa Barbara, can't get enough of this picturesque city! Decided to stop at Sunshine Cafe, Yelp pics of their food items looked cool! Ordered breakfast burrito, they use whole pinto beans which gives the burrito an authentic taste. Potatoes on side with green onion topping were very good. BLT sandwich very hearty, and coffee nice and strong! Recommended!"}]}
