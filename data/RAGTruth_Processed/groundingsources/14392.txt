{"question": "what is the difference between essential and nonessential amino acids", "passages": "passage 1:Nine out of the 20 amino acids are essential, but adults only need to obtain eight of them: valine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine and tryptophan.The ninth amino acid -- histidine -- is only essential for infants.ine out of the 20 amino acids are essential, but adults only need to obtain eight of them: valine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine and tryptophan.\n\npassage 2:Don't think of nonessential amino acids as being unnecessary.. Your body is able to make some amino acids if you don't get them from your diet. Your body creates them from essential amino acids or by breaking down protein products -- thus they are not essential to obtain from your diet.These acids include alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, ornithine, proline, serine and tyrosine.our body creates them from essential amino acids or by breaking down protein products -- thus they are not essential to obtain from your diet.

Nonessential amino acids can be made by the body, while essential amino acids cannot be made by the body so you must get them from your diet.You must have all of the amino acids so your body can build the wide variety of proteins it needs. Protein is needed for the repair, growth and maintenance of the cells.mino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins. Nonessential amino acids can be made by the body, while essential amino acids cannot be made by the body so you must get them from your diet.\n\n"}
