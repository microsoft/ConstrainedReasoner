Used my Yelp app to find the Red Pepper Restaurant. Kind of off the main streets but what a great place for Chinese. I tried the Szechuan Pork with Fried Dumplings.\nThe Szechuan Pork was excellent. Good amount of pork, peppers, strip bamboo, cloud ear in a nice spicy sauce. Had a nice zing to it.\nAlso loved their Fried Pork Dumplings. Good juicy filling with a nicely pan fried skin. Skin was not doughy.\nEnjoyed my lunch. Look forward to the next time I'm in the area"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-09 01:41:08", "review_text": "Today was a bad day for red pepper.\nwas sucked in by Door Dash B.S. offer of 25% off.
