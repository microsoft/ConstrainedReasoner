I can't quite put my finger on it, but it has a strange aftertaste. The patty is also EXTREMELY thin, and I ordered a double. Also, not a generous amount of fries given and they lack salt so they're essentially flavorless. I was disappointed, hoping for a pleasant hole-in-the-wall experience. This was not it."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-03-30 16:52:10", "review_text": "Ordered take out from here during recent trip to Santa Barbara. Good COVID protocols in place: social distancing, masks, hand sanitizer everywhere. My 8-year-old - a very picky eater - loved their burger and fries. My husband and were thrilled to find a spot that had something for our child, and both of us (I'm a vegetarian and he is NOT!). Their vegetarian burrito was tasty, generously sized and stuffed with fresh veggies. The carnitas burrito also got rave reviews. This is a small local business - please consider supporting them over a chain restaurant if you are craving Mexican and/or burgers! Food was well prepared and an incredible value."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-11-09 22:04:05", "review_text": "Hole in the wall next to El Zarape. $8 for a double cheeseburger, thick cut fries, and a bottled mexican coke. It's 3 min from my house and the burger is standard but it's done right and hits the spot."}]}
