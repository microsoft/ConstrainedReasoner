'Bold and the Beautiful' Spoilers: Hope and Steffyâ€™s New Feud, Logan Believes Finn Deserves Better?
The Bold and the Beautiful (B&B) spoilers tease that Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) and Hope Logan's (Annika Noelle) will be reignited. She Knows Soaps reports that Hope makes a play for John 'Finn' Finnegan (Tanner Novlan), and Steffy finds out.
Hope and Steffy spent years fighting over Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton). He would waffle between the women, each one believing they were his favorite. He did this for years. Steffy decided she could not do that anymore, finding a man with only eyes for her.
Sheila Carter's (Kimberlin Brown) charges were dropped, making her a free woman. Ever since her jail release, Sheila has been a thorn in Finn's side, demanding to have a relationship with him.
The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say that Finn and Hope will bond over Sheila and Deacon Sharpe's (Sean Kanan) relationship. They will plot for a way to break them up. In the meantime, they will develop a deep friendship that could become more.
Soaps Spoilers reports that Hope will confide in her mother, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang), that she believes Finn deserves better than Steffy. She points out that she wouldn't leave town even with a Sheila threat if he were her husband.
It's clear that Hope is beginning to develop feelings for the handsome doctor. It could spell trouble when Steffy gets wind of it.
