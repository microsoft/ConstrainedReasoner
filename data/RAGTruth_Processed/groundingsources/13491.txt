'Young and the Restless' Spoilers: Is Courtney Hope Leaving 'Y&R'? The Soap Star Responds
The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers tease that Sally Spectra (Courtney Hope) could be leaving Genoa City. Courtney Hope replied to a comment on her Instagram, clearing up the pesty rumor of her exit.
A Y&R fan replied to one of Hope's posts, stating she will miss her when she leaves the CBS soap opera. She praised her acting abilities, noting that it was sad that she was leaving the show.
Courtney responded, "I am not leaving. I am not going anywhere:)"
In July, Soap Opera Spy reported that Courtney could leave the soap to return to The Bold and the Beautiful. It never happened, and so far, it appears she isn't planning on a soap jump.
The soap publication supported their claims of Hope's departure by pointing out her absence for a few weeks. Sally had a miscarriage and left for Los Angeles to reconnect with her family.
Hope stated her disappearance from The Young and the Restless was a vacation. She had been on the show daily for several months. The actress earned a well-deserved break.
Now, she's back on the show and is gearing up to open her fashion house in Genoa City. She still needs to decide what Newman brothers is right for her. Eventually, she will have to make a decision. Y&R viewers expect her to pick Adam Newman (Mark Grossman), which could reignite another battle between Adam and Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow).
