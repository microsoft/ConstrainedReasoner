It's absolutely the BEST!! Beautifully handmade crust and fresh toppings. Not fancy just delicious. And the salads are incredible. Best Caesar with real anchovy dressing. Market salad has yummy dill ranch, shaved vegetables on yummy lettuce. I don't love the atmosphere, so we always get it to go. It's super popular so get your order in early! But it's definitely our favorite pizza in SB."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 06:13:46", "review_text": "Great pizza but limited toppings odd hours and long wait time for food.\n\nThey really should open at 11am like any other normal pizza place."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-20 02:58:37", "review_text": "Hands down the best dang pizza in all of Santa Barbara. Not even close. Simple menu and from the crisp on the crust and bottom to the tang in the red sauce, SB you have a winner. It's artisan pizza meets NY on the west coast. Proves you don't need to be in the funk zone to have something great and feels like Brooklyn back 20\nYears ago in the fact that they are hip but hard working and making something great. The Caesar salad had a great dressing and fresh greens to boot."}]}
