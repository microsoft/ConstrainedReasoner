I hate having to go into this restaurant. No pride in their place. Today the woman's bathroom was soooo disgusting. Dirty, no toilet paper, plugged up toilet, tp all over the floor. Obviously no employee had been in there to clean in a long time.  Stay away from this place. It gets worse each time I've gone in. Time to find another pit stop. If they don't take care of their bathrooms, can imagine what their kitchen and food is like?\nIt doesn't deserve any positive rating."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-08-13 18:31:16", "review_text": "Food is just ok. Service is very bad. Yesterday the \"blue shirt\" store manager jumped in front of several people waiting to use the soda machine. When he did that he looked back at me and said \"you loose and I win.\" Words were exchanged and I left. There is a McDonalds across the street that will get my business now."}]}
