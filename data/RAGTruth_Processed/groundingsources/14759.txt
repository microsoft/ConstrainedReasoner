I go there to study and their coffee is good and food is decent! But due to covid19, there drive thru is only open and the last 2 times I have gone to get a breakfast bagel and croissant, they totally burned my order ! The first time, I thought maybe they're just busy (2 cars infront ) but it happened a second time and im not impressed! Their breakfast items are pricey and to be handed a clearly burnt breakfast even where the egg is overcooked. Probably should go over how long they warm things up!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2020-04-30 18:53:38", "review_text": "Coffee was bitter, chocolate croissant was too hard wouldn't go there again if I were would be only for the Mexican mocha!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-02-09 19:07:40", "review_text": "I stopped by Zizzo's this morning for a cup of coffee and the experience exceeded my expectations. The gentleman who greeted me at the window was friendly and engaging and even offered my dog a treat! He also called me by my name (since he noticed it on my company car). This attention to detail to make an experience more personal is what customer service is all about. I was pleasantly surprised and I will definitely think of Zizzo's when I need a coffee or a ham & cheese croissant out in Goleta."}]}
