{"question": "how to change bulb in commercial landscape light", "passages": "passage 1:Depending on the type of bulb and its wattage, you can expect to shell out anywhere from $20 to nearly $100 per bulb. If you choose LED lights to use in your landscape lighting, it is recommended that you place their fixtures higher up in a place that is difficult to reach.\n\npassage 2:LED Landscape Lighting Pros. Although LED lights are more expensive to buy, in the long run, they are worth it. This is because they have a much longer life than halogen bulbs at anywhere from 30,000 to 50,000 hours. You can rest assured that your landscape lighting will burn bright for much longer than one year.\n\npassage 3:If your landscape lights seem to burn out faster than ever before, it may not be the fault of cheaper materials or shoddy workmanship; the fault may be in the method you use to change the bulb. Many modern landscape lights use halogen bulbs, both for inexpensive use and for the brighter light they give. If you touch a halogen bulb with your bare hands, the oils from your skin can transfer to the bulb. These oils will heat up and burn on the surface of the bulb, creating a thin spot in the glass that will cause it to burn through much more quickly than usual. Take precautions when changing halogen bulbs, and your landscape lights should last through the season.\n\n"}
