{"question": "how do i eject flash drives", "passages": "passage 1:When you do so, you'll see that the Trash icon changes to an Eject icon (same symbol that's on an Eject key). By doing that the drive will be dismounted, and its icon will disappear from the desktop; once that's done you can safely unplug it. The reason to use an Eject command or drag it to the Trash is to make sure the drive has been dismounted before disconnecting it.\n\npassage 2:Safely Removing a Flash Drive. When you insert a flash drive into a computer running Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, an icon reading Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media displays on the system tray. To unplug your flash drive, right-click that icon, and select Eject USB Flash Drive. If it's safe to eject, a notification displays Safe to Remove Hardware. If instead, the utility notifies you that the flash drive is in use, close any files or applications that you are running off the flash drive, and then try again.\n\npassage 3:There is one more type of device you should never eject and that is a device you have booted an OS from. By \u201cnever eject\u201d we mean don\u2019t ever pull the drive out of the system unless the computer is turned off or the entire operating system is loaded into RAM like winPE.\n\n"}
