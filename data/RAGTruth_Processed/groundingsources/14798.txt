The strami is thin cut and piled high.  My first bite screamed overly salted. Second bite screamed no flavor and I mean zero flavor. The \"dip\" [au jus] was NOT real flavored but from bullion and tasted chemically. And it too was salty. Came with a small one inch high cup of pickles which were olive green in color yet crunchy. These pickles were the most salted of all. \n\nOh yeah, $13.68 for the strami and diet Coke. Really?\n\nWon't be back unless I want to jack up my blood pressure."}]}
