We ordered a Blue Bowl, Green Bowl, and a Coconut Bowl.  All came with blueberries, bananas, strawberries, and gluten free granola on top. Coconut and honey are optional, and you can add other stuff for extra cost (e.g. nut butter, bee pollen, etc.).  The bowls are quite large and were delicious. Would definitely stop in again for more!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-03 15:48:55", "review_text": "This is a wine-lovers secret garden! Fantastic selection of local and European wines - pairs well with the fresh bread, too! We LOVE being part of the wine club and getting the lowdown from Amy each month. A great local market - from deli, to staff, to goods - love PHF."}]}
