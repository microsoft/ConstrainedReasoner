I tried this place twice and the chicken is super over cook and dry. I gave them a second chance because I thought maybe there having an off day ! They don't serve the amount that OXNARD does. I also asked for extra beans and the guy said yes yes . But he never told the cook in the back. So I didn't get extra beans and the rice is hard ! Under cooked ! Please do not eat here ! Try another location! I love el pollo loco but not this location! \n\nYou will get hard rice and over over over cooked chicken ! That's hard and taste a little weird .\n\n\nI would do zero stars if I could ! \nBad bad bad bad bad bad !"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2018-05-24 05:05:11", "review_text": "Normally, I LOVE El Pollo Loco. But this location? No. \n\nPlace looked like it was ready to close, and extremely unwelcoming at 9pm (closes at 11pm) \n\nAsked for extra dressing for both of my two salads, gave me NO dressing on either (not even what it come with normally)\n\nSalsas were not in their normal silver cooler on ice, but were instead laid out on the counter. Little fruit flies were hovering around them. When I got home to try them, the green salsa was RANCID. Normally my favorite salsa ever, and this was disgusting.\n\nWait time took forever, and nobody was given a receipt but they kept calling out \"order #whatever\". How tf are we supposed to know our order without receipts???"}]}
