It was a busy day, so it was understandable there was a wait! I wasn't complaining! The man taking my order was very nice and service oriented, even offering me a free fountain drink while I wait for my orange chicken to be done. He told me to tell the cashier he offered me a free drink when I check out, which I did and got a undesired response. The cashier snapped at me pretty much accusing me of thinking I thought I \"deserved\" a free compensation more than all the other people waiting. The attitude was ridiculous. I totally understand If he wasn't allowed to offer me a drink, but at least say it politely without attacking my character? And even after that, I open the box of the food I patiently waited for to see and unfortunately taste that both my orange chicken and Beijing beef have been not only cooked in bad/old oil, but also the protein itself was old. With the health concerns going around campus I think it's in the UCens best interest to be serving FRESH well prepared food. I'm curious to see the sanitary conditions in the back of that kitchen. Anyways other than the nice man who offered me a drink, my overall experience here lacks even one star. Should've gone to subway."}]}
