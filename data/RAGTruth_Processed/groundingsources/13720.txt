Stopped in for lunch because I've virtually run out of places to eat around my work.  Got recommended this place in passing conversation and I thought \"why not\".  Definitely will not return as: \n\n1) Food quality was poor.  I could care less about the frills and decorations of a place and base my opinion of a restaurant almost entirely on the food quality.  Definitely the thing that stuck out the most.\n2) Very expensive for what you get.  The portions for price were about on par with a more upscale place, yet with half the quality.  If you're going to charge that much, at least fill me up.\n3) Did I mention the food isn't very good?\n\nThe people were all very nice, so I feel somewhat bad about the rating.  Like I said, my opinion of a restaurant is almost all based on food, so that's the reason why.  The place looked clean and well decorated, so I don't know what the past reviews were talking about."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2013-11-16 23:38:50", "review_text": "Please spread the word -- Takenoya has PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN.
