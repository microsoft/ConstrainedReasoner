Tragedy Strikes as Missouri Man's High-Speed Drive to Pumpkin Patch Ends in Fatal Crash
A trip to the pumpkin patch took a horrific turn when a 25-year-old man allegedly drove at speeds exceeding 90 mph, resulting in a catastrophic collision that claimed the lives of his girlfriend and their 2-year-old daughter. Derrius Tolson now faces two counts of first-degree involuntary manslaughter as the details of the deadly crash come to light.
The incident unfolded on a fateful Saturday, October 14th, when Tolson sped through a red light at the exit ramp for southbound I-435. A patrolling Kansas City Police officer had noticed that Tolson's Jeep was in a reckless chase or race with another vehicle, leading to this tragedy.
Tolson's Jeep was hurtling at an estimated speed of 92 to 94 mph within a 40 mph zone when it collided with a Honda Accord, sending the Jeep tumbling multiple times. While Tolson survived the crash with minor injuries, his girlfriend, identified as Deja Perkins, was tragically pronounced dead at the scene. The couple's 2-year-old daughter, who was ejected from the vehicle, was found lifeless in the grass nearby.
Remarkably, the driver of the Honda emerged without apparent injuries. She recounted hearing a deafening crash and seeing a vehicle overturning to her right just before the impact.
Another witness, driving a Penske Ford 350 van, confirmed that the blue Dodge Challenger, linked to the fatal race, collided with the van before the disaster. It became evident that the vehicles were racing against each other.
Tolson disclosed that he had been driving his family to the pumpkin patch. Just an hour before the accident, he had dropped off his stepdaughter. The fatal encounter with the racing vehicles took place when they encountered a mysterious Chrysler 300 with no license plate and tinted windows.
Tolson recounted that the driver of the Chrysler seemed to challenge him at a traffic intersection. Feeling threatened and surrounded by the Chrysler, he accelerated in an attempt to distance himself. Unfortunately, the risky move led to the tragic flip-over of his Jeep. Tolson admitted to running a red light before the collision.
The authorities also discovered a loaded firearm and a backpack containing marijuana and scales near the crash site. Tolson confessed that these items belonged to him, and he had been using marijuana recreationally.
Tolson currently remains in custody on a $500,000 bond. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and additional charges could follow as the tragic consequences of his high-speed drive continue to be revealed.
