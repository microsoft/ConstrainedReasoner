I ordered a pizza and it was the worst I've ever had. My friend and I both tried a slice and then left it untouched. The bartender (Christine) wasn't very friendly and charged me for two drinks instead of one and added an \"entertainment district fee\". The total for my bill was $50 when all I ordered was a cocktail ($12) and pizza($14)... overall I'm very disappointed. The security was nice enough to help me get the second drink off of the bill, however the tip was not adjusted and neither was the \"entertainment district fee\"."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-14 05:10:08", "review_text": "Worst service :-) I get that Saturday nights are busy but all 3!! bartenders passed my boyfriend and I too many times in a 25-minute window and not one person helped us. We literally made eye contact too and they'd just look away or at each other.

Unbearable has got you covered! Also I LOVE the food here! The portobello burger is one of my FAVORITES! The staff is so kind and warm. They treat you like a friend and call you by the first name. This is my football go to bar! #graceydogofthemonth"}]}
