Packed with dry chicken and steak that could have been sitting for days. At least simmer in juices so it's softer. This puppy is as dry as the Mexican desert. The shrimp was ok and it was nice the rice was light. Definitely needed drowning from the salsa bar to help it down.\n\nNothing impressed me and I don't know what kind of repeat business Rubys gets. It wont be from me."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2008-09-04 16:03:53", "review_text": "It's a diner.  Our hotel gave us a map with restaurants and things to see and do in Santa Barbara.  I read about this diner.  The map said it was a 1940's diner.  SO OF COURSE WE HAD TO GO!  But, it was not. \n\nIt's one of those chain diners with new but vintage looking decor. \n\nI had a cheeseburger, Gary had a tuna melt.  The food was average diner food.  Not bad, not fantastic. \n\nGary knew I was sad that it wasn't a 1940's diner and he pointed out a sign that said Independently Operated. That made me feel a little better."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2008-07-24 21:58:55", "review_text": "It's a diner.  Come for a burger, fries, and a shake.  Food isn't too greasy and it's always satisfying.  The place is clean and service isn't bad.  Kind of expensive, but my stomach doesn't complain."}]}
