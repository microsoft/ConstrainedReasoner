{"question": "describe the brewing process of beer", "passages": "passage 1:If brewing an ale, which account for the majority of beers by style, the brewer will pitch ale yeast and let the temperature of the fermenting beer rise to a toasty 65-76 degrees \u2013 perfect for ale yeast.Also called top-fermenting yeast, ale yeast forms a thick layer pillowy foam at the top of the fermentation vessel.autering. The next step in the brewing process is the take the mash, and separate out the spent grain from the sugary liquid known as wort (pronounced wert). This process is called lautering. To begin the lautering process, the mash is transfered to vessel with a false-bottom called a lauter tun.\n\npassage 2:The Brewing Process. The brewing process consists of eight key components: malting, milling, mashing, brewing, cooling, fermentation, racking and finishing. Malting: The grain is added to a vat along with water and allowed to soak for about 40 hours.he Brewing Process.

The next step in the beer brewing process is called the boil. At the end of the boil we will have a finished wort (pronounced wert). To start, the liquid from the mash is put into a huge brew kettle.The one used at the Carolina Brewery holds more than 600 gallons (2,270 L).It is a steam jacketed brew kettle.n order for each batch of beer to taste the same, exactly the same amount of the same type of hops must be added at exactly the same time during each boil. In the next section, we'll see the next step in the brewing process.\n\n"}
