{"question": "what is the difference between cfm and scfm", "passages": "passage 1:SCFM and ACFM. The term standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) is usually used as a standard reference. condition for flow rate performance for atmospheric pressure at sea level, as opposed to. actual cubic feet per minute (ACFM) is typically used to rate flow rate performance of. compressor systems for actual pressure and temperature.\n\npassage 2:CFM, or cubic feet per minute, denotes the unit of compressed airflow for air conditioning units. SCFM stands for standard cubic feet per minute, a measurement that takes into account standard conditions. Cubic feet per minute indicates how much air flows through air conditioning as the machinery pushes air through ducts of a building. An air conditioner produces roughly 400 cubic feet per minute per ton of cooling capacity. Keep Learning.\n\npassage 3:Answers.com\u00ae is making the world better one answer at a time. SCFM is the amount (volume) of air that would happen if your air were at room temperature, and atmospheric pressure (0ft above sea level, 14.7psi). CFM (cubic feet per minute) is the amount (volume) of air that happens at the specific temperature and pressure.\n\n"}
