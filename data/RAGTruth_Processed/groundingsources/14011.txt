The black sheep is the first (and sadly last) place I revisited in town, because I got food poisoned. Me and my boyfriend shared the risotto at night. Then I started vomiting at 3 am. It was really scary. My boyfriend didn't feel the nausea by then so I thought it might be Covid or anything else. But then he started feeling sick too and eventually vomited in the afternoon. We didn't had anything in between. Excuse my words, but it's clearly the not digested risotto..\nReally hope I could enjoy the lovely side of the town next time."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 17:32:43", "review_text": "Service was substandard.\nFood was over salted...really over salted. \nThere was plenty of tables available but we were seated in a crowded section of the patio very close (like a guy behind me would tilt his head back and hit my head)."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-15 06:44:32", "review_text": "My favorite restaurant in the world. Incredible food and managed with class and care. Genuine people doing great work. I've been maybe half a dozen times as I don't live in the area, but I would ride 70 miles on a unicycle to have cold 3 day old leftovers from this place. The place feels like home, with better food."}]}
