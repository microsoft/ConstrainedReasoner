Prince William Disturbed by Meghan's Missing Engagement Ring
Meghan Markle Continues to Don Princess Diana's Treasured Artifacts
In a recent public appearance, Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, was seen wearing the late Princess Diana's Cartier watch.
This event came amidst concerns from Prince William about the absence of Meghan's engagement ring, which holds gems from his mother's collection.
The Duchess donned the watch in a video with the Fisher House Foundation, following the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf, Germany, where she was noticeably not wearing her engagement ring.
The absence of the ring has reportedly caused unease within the palace, with Prince William expressing his concerns through mutual friends. "Not knowing where they are is disturbing for William," an anonymous source revealed.
Recent information from royal insiders suggests that a loose setting on the ring, which required servicing, might be the reason for its absence during the Invictus Games. Despite this, Meghan was seen wearing her wedding ring and an eternity band, a gift from Prince Harry in 2019.
The Cartier Tank Louis Cartier watch, worn by Meghan, was a gift from Princess Diana's father, the 8th Earl Spencer.
The princess began wearing it more frequently after her divorce in 1996. The watch was passed down to Prince Harry after Princess Diana's death, and is now worn by his wife, Meghan.
Meghan's engagement ring, given to her by Prince Harry in 2017, features two smaller stones from Princess Diana's collection and a larger, ethically sourced stone from Botswana.
Following the birth of their first child, Prince Archie, in 2019, the ring was reset on a thin micro-pav√© band.
