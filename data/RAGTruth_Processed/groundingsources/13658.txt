Waffles were perfectly prepped and the chicken was the nice mix of crispy yet moist. It did come with honey which was unexpected for me since I'm from the East Coast and would normally have some delish Canadian Maple syrup.\n\nService was quick and friendly. Very efficient. Loved having brunch on the outside patio. Cute little location with great ambiance.\n\nThe only thing I'd recommend is to work on the cold brew coffee I got. Not sure if it was how it was prepped but the coffee was off (tasted very light)."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-08-18 23:32:30", "review_text": "This was the best brunch experience we had in Santa Barbara during this weekend. Grace was fantastic and beautifully described all of the dishes we asked about. Service is on point and OMG get the smoked pork shoulder- to die for. Also, maybe the best Bloody Mary I've ever had.

This wine bar goes beyond a tasting room and is as good as it gets if you're looking for one stop offering of impeccable service, knowledgable staff, gracious hospitality, outdoor patio, and a wine list that represents the California footprint with expertise.  \n\nFood pairings are a delight when reading up on their menu, you'll be excited to read the names of many hard to find, stunning wines from local family owned, small production vitners as a common offering at this wine bar, i.e. Bryan Babcock's \"Ocean's Ghost\" Pinot Noir (a 92 point effort on the 2016 bottling).  \n\nThe only crime is that I live so far away and can only enjoy when I return home to California!"}]}
