Started with the pea soup it was the best I ever had,  can't wait to go back to have more. The best ever Veal, I've had veal in French restaurants before it didn't even compare to this. So delicious. The desserts are so good. Then it ended with chocolate truffles. It couldn't get better. I'm looking forward to going back. I already know what I'm trying next, the duck.\nIt's easy to pass by, but don't, best food experience ever. \nCan not leave out the service, they are so attentive and made you feel special. \nEverything top notch."}]}
