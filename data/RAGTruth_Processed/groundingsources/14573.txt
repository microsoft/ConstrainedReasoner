I got a veggie burrito with guacamole and the flavors were really good. My main complaint is that all the ingredients weren't strained enough when being placed in the burrito, resulting in a soggy filling. It was very difficult to eat - just imagine a tortilla wrapped around liquids lol. Also I prefer my fajitas grilled much more, but that is my personal preference. Other than those things, I absolutely loved the Mexican rice and guacamole flavors. I can see why it's a staple of college students around Santa Barbara!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-08 02:27:02", "review_text": "Got their burrito and horchata...it was so tasty. The flavors on the pulled beef was amazing and overall everything tasted fresh. Defiantly would go again, it's the perfect place for Mexican food cravings."}]}
