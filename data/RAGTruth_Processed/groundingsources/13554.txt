Texas Woman Sentenced to Over Five Years for Multi-State Bank Fraud Scheme
Cristina Michelle Husbands, a 48-year-old woman from Dallas, Texas, has been sentenced to over five years in prison for her role in a bank fraud conspiracy. This scheme led to the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks across multiple states including Mississippi, Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas.
Husbands pled guilty to bank fraud after stealing $108,000 from Regions Bank customer accounts in various cities in Mississippi. In her defense, she claimed to have been coerced into committing these crimes during a period when she was homeless and struggling with drug addiction and an abusive relationship. Her attorney, Merrill K. Nordstrom, emphasized her vulnerability and desperation at the time, noting that the true masterminds of the fraud often prey on individuals in precarious situations like hers.
The court learned that Husbands was targeted by recruiters at homeless shelters and outside clinics that provide treatment for opiate addiction. She was then used to carry out fraudulent activities, including creating false identification documents to access and withdraw funds from bank accounts. The transactions took place between November 2021 and April 2022, involving at least four known victims and various amounts of money withdrawn in the form of cashier's checks and cash from Regions Bank branches.
At the time of her federal arrest in Mississippi, Husbands was already incarcerated in Texas on charges including fraud, forgery, and identity theft. U.S. District Judge Sul Ozerden sentenced her to 64 months in prison, followed by five years of supervised release. She was also ordered to pay $481,140 in restitution. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie prosecuted the case, while Husbands expressed regret for her actions and apologized to her victims. Despite her guilty plea, she still faces pending cases for similar crimes in other states.
