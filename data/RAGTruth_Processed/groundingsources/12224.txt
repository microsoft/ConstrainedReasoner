{"question": "what is the difference between inbreeding and selective breeding", "passages": "passage 1:Selective breeding is a method of breeding that allows only those individual organisms with desired characteristics to produce the next generation. Humans use selective breeding, which takes advantage of naturally occurring genetic variation, to pass desired traits on to the next generation of organisms.\n\npassage 2:Selective breeding is a method of breeding that allows only those individual organisms with desired characteristics to produce the next generation. Humans use selective breedi \u2026 ng, which takes advantage of naturally occurring genetic variation, to pass desired traits on to the next generation of organisms.\n\npassage 3:New varieties. Natural selection and selective breeding can both cause changes in animals and plants. The difference between the two is that natural selection happens naturally, but selective breeding only occurs when humans intervene. For this reason selective breeding is sometimes called artificial selection.\n\n"}
