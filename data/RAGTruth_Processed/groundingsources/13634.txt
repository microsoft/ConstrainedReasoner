My boyfriend and I came to Bree'osh for a day trip to Santa Barbara from LA and this was our first stop. It was everything we wanted and more! We got a croissant, the Bree'Osh Breakfast Sandwich, and a Three Egg Omelette with mushrooms, gruyere, and spinach. The croissant was delicate, crispy on the outside, and airy on the inside with just enough softness and chew - simple done right! The omelette was also done very well; they were extremely generous with the mushrooms and it was well flavored. The egg was soft and buttery. The bree'osh breakfast sandwich was my favorite!! As someone who loves burgers, this was exactly what I wanted for brunch. It was so tasty and very filling, and the brioche bread was amazing! I wish the egg was a little bit saltier, but it was not hard to add salt myself. \n\nOverall, 5 stars for sure! We can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-16 17:47:12", "review_text": "Great staff. Kiersten and Kathy do it again with a smile behind that mask\n\nAs you can see from the mushroom croissant that my friend had they are very generous with the mushrooms. Even though sometimes there a fair amount of people when you when we regularly find an outdoor seat\n\nI bring my own sea salt.  It's particularly good on the mushroom cheese croissant"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-10 17:09:04", "review_text": "Absolutely heavenly baked goods! Like, unreal how good they are. I also got a grilled cheese, which was divine and came with a nice side salad, making it a complete meal for a decent price, which I totally appreciated. I also got a chai latte which was windy and not overly sweet."}]}
