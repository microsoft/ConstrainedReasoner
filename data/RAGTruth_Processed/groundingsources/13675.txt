The server we had was genuine and friendly. We sat on the patio with our dog and despite it being chilly she made sure to check on is often. All of the food was exceptional. I ordered the brisket which is amazing. It falls apart in your mouth and has a fantastic flavor thanks to the 15 hours of slow cooking. My boyfriend got a half rack of ribs which were equally tender and delicious. The owner came out and spoke to us several times and even treated our dog to some of the fabulous brisket. \n\nIf you are looking for exceptional BBQ at a place with a down-to-earth staff this is it. We live in Ventura buy we will definitely be back."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-01-01 00:15:12", "review_text": "Love this place! Always loved the food as they truly due have Killer BBQ. From pulled pork sandwiches to tri-tip the food is always a win. Now with the new location with the huge dog friendly patio, I think I just found my new favorite spot to watch a game, have a beer or a great meal. Looking forward to going there again and again!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-12-19 18:37:48", "review_text": "Killer B's IS OPEN - 731 De La Guerra Plaza!  It quietly reopened earlier in December and is well worth searching out at its new location inside De La Guerra Plaza across from City Hall.  Entrance is through the brightly-lit, large patio with plenty of tables (each complete with a full paper towel dispenser - they don't mess around) and heaters for cooler evenings.  For the sports fans there are flatscreen TVs on the exterior walls with volume off or very low for the dinner-conversation fans.  The inside dining area looked warm and inviting.  My two friends and I sat outside and witnessed the BBQ items being removed from the gigantic smoker in the corner of the patio; proof positive this is REAL, slow-cooked BBQ, not baked, as previously mentioned by a person with a wooden \"pallet.\"  We were told the menu selection will expand once they get their rhythm and flow going with the new kitchen, a wise strategy to keep quality of food and service high.  The juicy pulled-pork sandwich was loaded and stacked tall, and got a big thumbs up.  The baby back ribs were meaty, tender, and moist, with knock-out flavor.  Those last remaining, tasty crisp bits clinging to the bone make one want to pick off every last morsel, so give yourself time to really work those ribs.  The rub and smoke flavors are well balanced with just the right amount of sweetness, tang, and rich carmelized goodness in the sauce.  My buddy, who is very particular about his beans, said the baked beans were delicious.  My side of green beans and corn was cooked just enough to leave a little crunch with nice roasted flavor.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Two of us were allowed to split a full rack of ribs and our 1-free-entree Axxess card deal was honored with a smile - gotta love that!  The owner, Will, visited with us for a while and told us of his plans for the new location and future events, all of which sound great. My dinner mates and I are slow-cook BBQ fans and are so happy to have a place in Santa Barbara that does it right.  Next time there is live music in De La Guerra plaza, I will find a table there and enjoy what the full bar has to offer.  We hope Killer B's kills it in the new location so we can continue to enjoy local BBQ that is the real deal."}]}
