They serve wine, I guess if that makes them a wine bar ... great? But they are actually more into their cocktails and drinks. This place is next door to a theater so you will find a theme of theaters and plays in their drink names and descriptions.\n\nThe bartenders are fun, but catch them early since they get a little messy as the night wears on. We were wrongly charged, quite a few times, and despite sitting at the bar it was hard to get service or our orders. They're fun people to hang out with though ... I suppose?\n\nThe wines here are ok, so don't come here if you want wine, but it's a great place for a cozy date on State St."}]}
