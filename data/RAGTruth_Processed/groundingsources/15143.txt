{"question": "differences between elements compounds and mixtures", "passages": "passage 1:Another difference between compounds and mixtures of elements is the ease with which the elements can be separated. Mixtures, such as the atmosphere, contain two or more substances that are relatively easy to separate.The individual components of a mixture can be physically separated from each other.nother difference between compounds and mixtures of elements is the ease with which the elements can be separated. Mixtures, such as the atmosphere, contain two or more substances that are relatively easy to separate.\n\npassage 2:Best Answer: mixtures 1) elements and compounds just mix together to form a mixture and no new compound is formed. 2)A mixture has a variable composition. 3)A mixture shows the properties of constituent substances 4)The constiuents can be seperated easily byphysical method.est Answer: mixtures 1) elements and compounds just mix together to form a mixture and no new compound is formed. 2)A mixture has a variable composition. 3)A mixture shows the properties of constituent substances 4)The constiuents can be seperated easily byphysical method.\n\npassage 3:Compounds are substances composed of two or more different elements. Compounds are also pure substances. A mixture is a physical combination of elements or compunds where the parts of the mixture are not chemically bonded and so retain their own identity.These elements and compounds can be separated by physical means.Answer #2). We are looking at the difference between elements, compounds, and mixtures. Elements are the purest form of a chemical substance and are composed of only one type of atom. In other words, all of the atoms in an element will have the same number of protons.\n\n"}
