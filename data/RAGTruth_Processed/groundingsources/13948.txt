Californians Still Moving to Texas - 102K in 2022
AP News recently released Californians are still moving to Texas, but not as high as previous years. Despite the decrease, over 100,000 people from California moved to Texas in 2022.
As mentioned in early summer, over 100,000 people from California moved to Texas to escape the high cost of living according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
AP News compared the recent arrival of Californians and noticed a decrease from 107,000 in 2021 to 102,000 in 2022. They cited the cost of living is going up in big cities in Texas.
Manuel Pastor, a professor of sociology and American Studies & Ethnicity at the University of Southern California said according to NBC Dallas:
"We are losing younger folks, and I think we will see people continuing to migrate where housing costs are lower. There are good jobs in California, but housing is incredibly expensive. It hurts young families, and it hurts immigrant families."
Other states are seeing an increase in Californians arriving.
Florida saw an increase of 13,000 more people in 2022. In 2022, 50,000 people arrived as compared to 37,000 in 2021.
Arizona was another location that saw an increase in people from California. The state saw a 5,000 increase from 2022 to 2021 as 74,000 Californians made Arizona their new home.
