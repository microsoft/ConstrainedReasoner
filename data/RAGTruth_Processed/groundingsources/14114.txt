Great staff, salad bar, full bar, cozy atmosphere.  And, we will come back.\n\nWe have been sampling lobster around town.  To date, the Tee-Off has the best in this area, though I have yet to try it at Reunion (the new East Beach grill).  Every restaurant has its charms and distractions. \n\nI knew I was taking a chance with Chuck's char broiled lobster, but at $48 I figured they would be careful.  It did not come out well (dry & blackened around edges...overcooked it seemed) , but the waitress, whom was very nice, disappeared after serving it.  I kept trying to get her attention but she was gone.  She did not even stop to chat when dropping off the check.  I honestly felt she knew there were questions about the lobster that she was not interested in entertaining...visually it was overcooked...did she even look at it?  We did not want to return the lobster--paid in full and left a 12% cash tip, normally we are 25% at this place.   \n\nAs foodies, we wanted to learn more.  Food is one of our great interests, and even a bad meal can turn into something special if you learn something new.  I really wanted to ask \"Was this a good example of the best lobster you can get with char broil?\"  Regardless of the answer (yes or no), I would have learned something interesting.  In my case, I learnt nothing, except to avoid that waitress."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-15 01:38:11", "review_text": "It's a decent restaurant but not worth their prices at all. I've been here about 4 or 5 times not by choice, and every time I am even more disappointed. All of the fish tastes pretty much the same and I was greatly disappointed with the salmon. Don't spend too much time deciding what steak you want either because it doesn't matter. They pretty much don't season any of their food Inspite of the slightest bit of salt that they put on. The side is always undercooked hard rice with a lemon slice. The salad bar is very good but that's about all they have going for them. Spend your money elsewhere and get better food."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-11 07:20:25", "review_text": "We had reservations for 7:15 and the restaurant was full of people! This was my third time at Chuck's and it did not disappoint. I ordered the halibut ($38) and it was amazing. It comes with teriyaki rice and the salad bar. The wait staff was wonderful. Thank you!"}]}
