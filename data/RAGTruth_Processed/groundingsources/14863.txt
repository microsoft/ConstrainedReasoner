There was a large amount of cars waiting. They took the car in front of us order and then turned off the lights. We drive up to the window and they tell us they're closed. The store hours online said they close at 10. It was 7:45. They were rude and dismissive."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-14 15:29:17", "review_text": "This place has the worse customer service.  The only reason ppl go here because it's one of the only drive thru. Employees ignore the drive thru when you pull ip. Waiting for 30mins to take my order so I just left. Also the lady who is working the morning drive thru has the worse attitude, I feel like I'm interrupting  her movie when ever I pull up. Just need a whole new staff or sell it to another restaurant. We don't want you there anymore Jack in the box."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-10 19:00:41", "review_text": "Rude drive thru employee my receipt stated a Etzel was the employee helped me and the attitude she carries when taking orders, handing out condiments, or even handing you your food is beyond rude. Will never come here again. I hope this particular restraunt either trains her on her customer service skills because she will not go far with that attitude or find someone that will run the drive thru and window better to bring customers back."}]}
