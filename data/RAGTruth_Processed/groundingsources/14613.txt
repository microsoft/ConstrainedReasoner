However, the quality is unfortunately not the same. Our online order was ready late even though the restaurant wasn't busy. Our go-to crispy tofu was mushy. We had to cook it for an additional 10 minutes in the air fryer at home and still was dripping with oil and doughy coating. The pad tai and curry were fine. The steamed veggies at the state location are a favorite with the mushrooms - Goleta location uses different veggies. The staff was very young and probably new here and probably doing their best. However, we will take the extra time to use the State location in the future."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-04 03:55:04", "review_text": "This is one of my go to favorite Thai restaurants in SB at the moment. The only items I have ordered are the eggplant salad and the drunken noodles, both amazing! \n\nThe eggplant salad is very large and a meal on its own, with eggplant, crispy fried onions, fresh tomato slices, cilantro and a hint of spiciness and lots of lemon. I usually order this with fried tofu which is placed on top of the colorful  salad and holds its crispiness as you eat your salad.\n\nI have ordered with a side of sticky rice in the past, but the sticky rice gets hard right away if you don't eat it so I pass on the sticky rice now.\n\nThe drunken noodles are full of flavor, and one of my favorite dishes to order if I come with someone that is very hungry and I can share my meal with.\n\nI ordered a Thai iced tea today and it was delicious! And the size was super large, unlike the other Thai restaurants in town. \n\nWill definitely continue to come here and enjoy other menu items!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-30 23:51:11", "review_text": "Amazing great food and service will be back soon.
