Had that The Counter/Hookburger/Smashburger look and taste. Quality meat and bun; The hot dog was deep fried and a little disappointing because it was a bit overcooked and shriveled, but for a restaurant at a zoo, this place deserves 6 stars."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-07-19 00:34:41", "review_text": "There was nobody in line, but the two employees behind the counter refused to take my order.  They insisted that I order online.  I eventually got the online menu to open on my phone, but it would not accept my order.  I gave up and bought water from the vending machine.  No prices are posted on the machine...I guess I'll find out how much when I get my Visa bill.   Boo on the Zoo!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-10-09 00:24:30", "review_text": "I love the new smash burgers and the online ordering is so easy to use, my 4 year old could do it.  And those zoo brew beers are super freakin delicious. Great prices for being a \"zoo/amusement park\". Feeding animals isnt cheap so i feel like im doing my part in conservation."}]}
