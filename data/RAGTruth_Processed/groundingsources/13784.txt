Been overlooking this spot for far too long. We were there on a particularly busy morning and you could tell they were a little stressed but nevertheless the food was great prices were reasonable and the service was friendly. Something about sitting having breakfast at the counter in a bustling diner that is a nice reminder to slow down and enjoy the world around you."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-02 21:37:59", "review_text": "Lots of food.

The service was friendly and fast, and everyone was pleased with their food. Blueberry pancakes were delicious and got 5 star ratings by grown ups and kids alike. The French toast and breakfast burrito were also winners."}]}
