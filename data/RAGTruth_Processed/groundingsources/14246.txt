We had the poke app which came out more like lettuce cups. It was fine. The calamari tasted like it could have come from an Olive Garden, and the Mac n cheese lacked flavor and had way too many bread crumbs on top. Beneath the top layer, they were soggy and flavorless."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-06-24 17:56:25", "review_text": "Our family of five had a great time eating dinner on the patio. Everyone, even the kids, enjoyed their meal. Five entrees and six beverages did not break the bank. Laid back atmosphere with really good food. Highly recommend the fish tacos and hard setter."}]}
