It's all humdrum standard food, heavy on the meat, with little innovation. The great lunch specials, still listed on the website, are gone. The bread on my BLT seemed old and just pulled from the whole wheat wonderbread bag. There was only one choice for soup and it was done for the day. Really, no reason ever to come here again."}]}
