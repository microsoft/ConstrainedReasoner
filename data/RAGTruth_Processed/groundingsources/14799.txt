The bartenders were nice enough, but I asked for 2 stickers, and on my bill, they were $3 a piece. Whenever I go to a brewery, they are usually free or $1. I was thinking, the bartender should have said, they are $3 a piece, which one do you want, or \"Here are are free ones, and here are the $3 ones.\" I realize I am a rube from Minneapolis, but please don't play me like a rube. I mean, for free, if I put this sticker up or post it on my social media page, isn't that worth $3? As I say to my wife, \"Just sayin'!\"\n\nAnyways, good little patio and pretty good beer. Looks like people liked their food too."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-18 19:22:34", "review_text": "Super cute, super friendly place!  We are planning an event there, so we went to check it out.  The person we were supposed to meet with wasn't available, but a young lady named Oli jumped right it and handled our visit.  Oli is delightful and a great ambassador for the business!  She gave us a tour, let us know what areas could be reserved for us, gave us various options for food/drinks and more.  We had lunch there to try out the food and it was awesome.  (Watch out for the chipotle sauce on the shrimp.  It is definitely spicy, but so flavorful you can't stop eating it.)  The \"backyard\" sitting area is very nice and cozy. Great place to enjoy some sun while you eat and drink.  They also have relaxing shady spots and firepits for nighttime pleasure.  The area is pet and child friendly.  As we were eating someone came to us with the person we were to meet with on the phone.  She said they had forgot that was her one Saturday off, but she had a wonderful attitude and took all the time we needed to answer our questions.  \n\nWe are not local to this venue, so I had to do most of the planning for this event via phone and email.  Seth has been my primary contact and he has been great to work with.  He is very responsive (which I love!) and detailed the various options they offer.  All-in-all I can say they have been very accommodating and we are looking forward to our event there May 2022!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-06 23:36:48", "review_text": "Good beer. Could do without the self referential photo story around the place. Happy you found yourselves on a trip - really. \n\nI wouldn't plaster those obnoxious smiles in my own living room."}]}
