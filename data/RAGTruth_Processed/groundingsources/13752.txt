Their food is good. There aren't a whole lot of Mediterranean places around and this place is a decent price. The problem is, I've tried to come here 4 times and the always seem to be out of rice. The first time I went, they told me there probably wasn't enough left, then they were able to give me some, so I guess I got the bottom of the barrel. The next 3 times they said they were out. What kind of Mediterranean place runs out of rice? It's insane. There's never even anyone there, are they only making enough for like 3 portions? As good as it was the first time, I don't think I'm going to try coming here again"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-11-04 01:17:44", "review_text": "Great food, you order your food and they make it for you, it's not bought or pre made, it's fresh. I love Mediterranean food and finding it in Isla Vista is even better. Make sure to try the cheese bourak and zaatar manaesh! The chicken shawerma is also very good :)"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-10-13 20:21:15", "review_text": "I had passed this place over in the past because they don't have shish kebab. But a friend recommended it and I gave it a try yesterday.\n\nMy choice was the beef shawarma plate which came with a salad, hummus, pita bread and some pickles.\n\nThe beef was excellent quality without the usual fat and gristle too many shawarma places give you. It had been marinated in a delicious sauce. The hummus was also flavorful. I was recently in the middle east and this definitely had the authentic flavors.\n\nThe $9 price was also a good deal for someone like me who does not need huge portions.\n\nIf they added lamb shish kebab to the menu I would happily give it five stars! In Isla Vista a bicycle rack would also be nice! Please give this place a try!"}]}
