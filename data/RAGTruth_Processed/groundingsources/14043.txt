This time is a Pad Thai from Pattaya Thai, and despite the chicken and shrimp being cooked very well and not overcooked, I unfortunately found this Pad Thai to be a bit bland. Now I have high standards for Pad Thai, but I know Pattaya is able to deliver better results. The flavors were all there, but with Pad Thai it is easy for there to be not enough flavor, which makes the dish taste terrible. This was alright.\n\nAveraged from my last review, this is 4 stars."}]}
