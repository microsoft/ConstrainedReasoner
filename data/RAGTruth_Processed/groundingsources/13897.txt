Texas Wins vs Biden on Border Security
Texas has won a preliminary victory in a court battle against the Biden Administration over the removal of barbed wire the state has installed to deter illegal immigrants along the banks of the Rio Grande.
After the state filed suit last week over Border Patrol agents snipping the barbed along the Rio Grande by hand - the state says federal agents doubled down against their objections by using heavy machinery to remove even more of its barbed wire:
"Federal agents used hydraulic-powered pallet forks to rip Texas’s fence—concertina wire, fencing posts, clamps, and all—out of the ground, holding it suspended in the air in order to wave more than 300 migrants illegally into Texas." -Office of The Texas Attorney General (State of Texas vs U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security)
So the state sought - and won -an Emergency Order preventing the federal government from cutting or removing any more of its barbed wire barriers through November 13, 2023. A hearing on the State's original lawsuit is set for November 7, 2023.
"Another win for Texas & our historic border mission. Biden created this crisis & has tried to block us at every turn. Attorney General Paxton & I are pushing back." -Texas Governor Greg Abbott (October 30, 2023)
