Even though I slightly dread the experience because I'd rather go to a one of a kind Santa Barbara local restaurant, this Chili's wasn't so bad. \n\nThis time we decided to bring some friends who'd never been to a Chili's. The boys had burgers and both really liked them, but the highlight was the drink for them. The chicken tacos were a little watery and not much flavor in the beans and rice.\nOur chip appetizer didn't have enough salt either, so maybe that's what was missing from the food as well.\n\nIt's the typical Chili's atmosphere, dark and cold, but very clean. It's in a great location. The waiter we had was nice and on top of it. The restaurant was not very busy so it wasn't very loud\n\nThe best part of the experience was the company, but would have much rather been to a local joint."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-07 16:00:27", "review_text": "I got curbside to-go from here last night, and it was pretty good! We got a sirloin steak and the ancho salmon, served with steamed broccoli, Mexican rice, and awesome blossom petals. We also ordered some fried pickles and the molten chocolate cake. We both liked the fried petals and pickles - nice and crispy, and each battered differently. The broccoli was also pretty good, and a much-needed break from the saltiness of everything else. The salmon was surprisingly not too overcooked, and the steak was alright too. We really couldn't finish everything and it was very rich, so we are looking forward to eating the chocolate lava cake later today. Thankfully, they packaged the ice cream separately from the cake so it should come together well. \n\nThe takeout experience was good, although they ran out of designated curbside to-go parking spaces. It's a popular option during the covid spike I'm sure. Staff was very nice and helpful. We don't eat at chains too often but we got a gift card here, and it was a fun sort of treat!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-11 08:05:37", "review_text": "I went here with my friends. I ordered chili on the side, but my server told me last minute that she did not want to serve me chili because it was bad and she even mentioned that I might get salmonella. This made me feel very comfortable that my server was looking out for me-- she was practically my guardian angel despite the fact that I had a little bit of the chili on my plate and I was still charged for my chili. Overall very fun, highly recommend. Rip my toilet after too."}]}
