Me & my mom usually do Chinese food for New Year's Eve & a co-workers of hers told her about China Palace & how it was her favorite place to go to. Ordering was very easy & super quick service. They were very organized & had my order ready for me when I walked in even though I was there a little earlier then the estimated time they gave me. Food was absolutely delicious & not over powered by the vegetables like I've been use to at other Chinese restaurants I've been to. Will for sure be back again and again! Super yummy delicious food!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-04 21:13:48", "review_text": "some of the worst service i have ever had. I had to stand in the restaurant for five minutes before the waitress even noticed me to take my credit card to pay. It's too bad because the food is actually very good. The waitress was sitting in a corner on her cell phone inside unmasked while I stood waiting to pay. She also did not bring me water and was unbelievably unattentive."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 04:08:34", "review_text": "Mixed up our order. Forgot one of the items. Gave us chicken by accident when we ordered beef. Mystery meat in the beef. They seemed disorganized with online orders. On the positive side, the fish was pretty good."}]}
