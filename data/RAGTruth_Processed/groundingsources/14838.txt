Not to mention the food was a total disappointment. Ants on the wall, rude waiter, and dirty to go boxes. OH! And I wasn't served my complimentary chips. I ordered a bean and cheese (wet burrito) and it was served warm borderline cold. The beans and enchilada sauce were probably canned... at least that's what it tasted like. The tortilla was chewy (and not in a good way) . If you're not from carp and want Mexican food I suggest walk past this place."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-09-14 04:41:08", "review_text": "The wife and I have frequented this restaurant a few times before, so we're familiar with the food, or so we thought. We ate at this restaurant on Friday, September 10th. \n\nMy wife will only eat chicken breast. Boneless and skinless. She doesn't eat thighs, drumsticks,  or wings. Nope. Ain't happening. \n\nShe ordered the hard shell tacos with chicken breast. I  ordered the mole negro, one of my favorite dishes. It was a dish my mom used to make for me.\n\nAs we started to eat I could see my wife's face. She didn't seem to be enjoying her meal.  I asked her what was wrong. The tacos were made with thigh meat. Ruined her meal, which ended up being rice & beans, chips and salsa.\n\nAs I  continued to eat my mole I noticed that the chicken didn't taste right. Mole has a strong flavor but I noticed that the chicken squares tasted a little \"tangy\". \n\nI ate about half of it but ended doing the same as the wife and only ate the rice and beans with chips and salsa. \n\nWe walked to the restaurant and not even halfway to our place my body started to let me know it wasn't happy. I ended up being sick until this afternoon  (buuuuurrrpp!!). Excuse me. *cue sour, gross aftertaste*\n\nThanks for ruining my vacation."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-08-29 20:50:43", "review_text": "Very slow service and lots of mistakes. Not much organization. They bring out the wrong food, two waiters keep asking us for drinks or for our order not knowing them at the other person just did. The food is so-so also."}]}
