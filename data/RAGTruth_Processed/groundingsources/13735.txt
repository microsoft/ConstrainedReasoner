Unfortunately, our evening was almost ruined by the rude hostess. We were waiting for ten minutes in front after a waiter told us he would seat us in a minute. We asked the hostess if there was a wait since since we had been there waiting for so long (with tables visibly open) and she began to berate us for some reason. We dealt with her mistreatment and allowed her to seat us. She sought to seat us away from the heaters on a winter evening but we quickly moved. Our actual waiter was very nice, fortunately. Again, the food was great but service needs to improve to meet basic standards!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-02 20:58:28", "review_text": "The food here is pretty good. Although the last time we ordered the beet salad and the beets came out with the imprint of a can. Obviously not fresh.\n\nWe have actually been here multiple times and one thing that stands out is the place is freezing. No attempt to keep it warm. Your plates come out of the kitchen warm but soon are very cold which makes for cold food. Disappointing in that respect"}]}
