They have both indoor and outdoor dining. The restaurant is connected to Phresh Tea (located on the right), and both use the same kitchen, so you can order Boba or anything on Phresh Tea menu while dining at Uniboil. \n\nUniboil are known for their hotpots. They also have other dishes on the menu if you're not into that. The prices are reasonable, and the hotpot portion is huge; you could probably share it with another person if you aren't too hungry. \n\nI really enjoyed the Beef Thai Tom Yum Hotpot. I've also had the Korean Army Stew the first time my family and I went, and it was good; I do prefer the Thai one better though. I've tried the sizzling beef dish (forgot what is called), popcorn chicken, and beef noodle soup. Sizzling beef and popcorn chicken were fantastic. I didn't like the beef noodle soup. The broth tasted fine, but the meats were terrible. I didn't have any meats in my bowl actually; it was like just fatty parts. \n\nCustomer service has been inconsistent; sometimes they're slow, and other times they're quick. Staffs are friendly though. They checked up on us all the time."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-20 04:45:18", "review_text": "Their boba drink is surprisedly good, I have a high standard for boba, their boba is definitely above average. Try their kumquat drink, or milk drink with less sweet ( it could be really sweet ). As for their food, I ordered a noodle soup for my son, the soup is good but not the round noodle they use. Order their drink if you visit."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-16 05:36:18", "review_text": "Felt weird vibes here. Was confused that it was also attached to the tea place next door and all the workers were more situated there. Thus it was a while and took effort to get a table at the restaurant side. Even tho there was only one other party there... \n\nWe came for the beef noodle soup and coffee. The soup Is the first picture on Yelp and looked delicious. But upon ordering the waitress said they didn't have it. They had run out. Plus they didn't have coffee either. At the end we decided not to stay"}]}
