Everything is absolutely delicious, they could add more seasoning to their breakfast potatoes, and avocado to their breakfast sandwiches, not going to lie. They're closed for remodeling, but I can't wait until they open back up!!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-11 18:40:02", "review_text": "* Nothing beats a beautiful and decadent warm cup of hot cocoa after a stressful week! I love that this cup is on the less sweet side, which pairs very well with their sweet pastries. Their latte art is beautifully done as well, which makes up for their $5.50 price point.\n\n* The lemon tart was textbook: had a beautiful shortbread crust with a lemon custard topped with a scorched meringue. It was flawless and I don't think I can point out any flaws. \n\n* The cake, however, had way too much cream and chocolate go the rest of the cake ratio which made it unsettling to eat and way too sweet. I think the flavor combination sounded good but unfortunately didn't deliver. \n\nWhat's unique is that I believe all the desserts are gluten free, which is incredible, and inclusive of our gluten free friends."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-08 04:43:21", "review_text": "Fantastic decadent chocolate cake. Friendly staff. The cake didn't taste gluten free at all. Blueberry lemon tarte was fantastic."}]}
