Decided to try Barbieri Kempe in the La Arcada. The three stars are for the location. La Arcada probably one of the most delightful places to sit in downtown Santa Barbara. Beautiful and quiet to average noise with soothing music. However Barbieri was a disappointment. The young lady acted as if we were bothering her. Maybe she was having an off day? She did not seem very knowledgeable about their wine and it seemed an effort for her to answer my questions. We choose a glass of Syrah from apparently the Beullton area, no more information was offered. Enjoyed sitting outside and sipping our wine but it would have been far better in an actual wine glass. Who serves a sixteen dollar glass of wine in plastic? Sat by the fountain and really enjoyed the ambiance, but won't be rushing back to Barbieri. Next time. We'll just have a glass of wine at one of the outdoor restaurants in the La Arcada"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-26 05:53:39", "review_text": "On a rare rainy Monday in downtown Santa Barbara, and after a tasty lunch at Satellite Wine Bar, I discovered Barbieri & Kempe, a delightful tasting room tucked nicely in the La Arcada Plaza.\n\nI hadn't heard much about this wine or winemaker, but walking by their big window and looking onto their comfy lounge and bright wall-of-wines, I knew I needed to enter and learn more.\n\nUpon entering we met Ra Ra who was behind the bar area and offered a warm and welcoming smile and greeting. She made us feel right at home and was able to answer every question we had about Barbieri & Kempe. It's always refreshing to meet someone like Ra Ra who knows so much about the varietals, vineyards, and wine styles. \n\nOnce we were hearing all about the various tasting options and looking at the tasting list, the one blend that caught my eye was something I had never seen or tasted before, and I was excited to learn more. Ra Ra was gracious in offering us a taste of the 2017 Barbieri Romanvs, Syrah and Viognier blend. Two of my favorite varietals, and all in one bottle. And it is delicious. I think I have found my new favorite SB County wine. \n\nDidn't get to experience a full tasting, but did buy a bottle of Romanvs and am excited to go back and spend more quality time with Ra Ra and Barbieri & Kempe."}]}
