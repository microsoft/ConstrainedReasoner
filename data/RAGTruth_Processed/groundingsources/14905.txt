When I first walked in, there was nobody in sight. I noticed that all of the food (especially meat and cheese) seemed old, and crusted over on the edges like it had been sitting for a while. Then I was \"greeted\" by a younger lady who did not say hi and wasn't the most friendly person. There was also an older lady at the register and after I said hello, she replied \"for here or to go\".  Both of the employees did not seem happy and should consider selling the franchise. I didn't get a chance to look at how clean the actual store was, so I can't comment on this. I can say that I won't come back to this location under this ownership and I will instead go to the one over by Trader Joe's on Calle Real."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-02-10 20:55:00", "review_text": "I walked in there, they were almost all out of veggies.
