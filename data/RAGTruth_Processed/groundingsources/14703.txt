It's packed with everything but meat(weak portion of meat) and I didn't think it was all that flavorful. It was ok, but not that great. I'm giving it 4 stars because the 2 German guys that I know love this place and would give it 5 stars. One of my friends said it was as good as anything that he'd have back home. So maybe it's just me."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-09-11 22:45:49", "review_text": "Sehr sch\u00f6nes Lokal und der D\u00f6ner war mehr als lecker! \nFalls man in Santa Barbara ist, sollte man auf jeden Fall dort hin."}]}
