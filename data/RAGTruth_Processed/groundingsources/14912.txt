Miramar Beach Bar, located on the upstairs deck at the Rosewood Miramar provided glorious views at all times of the day with great finger food. My girlfriends and I came here for lunch this morning prior to checking out from Rosewood. We ordered the following: \n\nTwo orders of the tortilla chips, guac, and salsa. (One order is good to share as an app for two people). Two people ordered the fried chicken sandwich and rated it a 4/5. One ordered the cheeseburger and rated it a 4/5, and I ordered the Italian sandwich (recommended to me by the waitress), 5/5. Overall, great lunch spot overlooking the beach if you want quick finger food. I also recommend the cute coffee truck parked out front to get any drinks (I recommend the iced oat vanilla latte)."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-09 17:47:38", "review_text": "My mom and I spent the holiday weekend in Montecito at this resort,  was exactly what I expected ..just a  wonderful get a way.
