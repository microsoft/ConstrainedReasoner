Racetrack mystery: CA exercise rider killed during horse training; Officials unsure how he died
The racing community is mourning the loss of Alfredo Luevano, a 53-year-old exercise rider, who tragically lost his life during a training incident at Los Alamitos Race Course early Saturday morning, the track announced.
Luevano was riding a filly on the backstretch when the incident occurred, and despite immediate assistance, he did not survive his injuries.
The track is located in Cypress, Calif. in Orange County.
The filly, named Fly From The Fire, emerged unscathed.
Details surrounding the incident remain unclear, with no eyewitness accounts providing precise information on what transpired, according to the racetrack.
Luevano was quickly transported to Long Beach Memorial, where he was pronounced dead.
The 2-year-old filly, Fly From The Fire, had previously made five starts this year under the guidance of trainer Mike Casselman.
Scheduled to participate in the seventh race on Saturday night, track management has decided to scratch her from the race as a precautionary measure.
Los Alamitos Race Course spokesperson Orlando Gutierrez expressed condolences on behalf of the racing facility, saying, "On behalf of the Los Alamitos Race Course family, we express our deepest condolences to Mr. Luevano's family members and friends."
Alfredo Luevano, born in the city of Luis Moya in Zacatecas, Mexico, had a distinguished professional riding career that included 33 mounts, with most of his rides taking place in Mexico and Colorado.
Earlier this year, he was issued an exercise rider license by the California Horse Racing Board.
Alfredo Luevano is survived by his wife, Marisela Martinez, and their children: Lisbet, Alfredo Jr., Alex, Aldo, and Camila.
He also leaves behind six grandchildren and his father, Augustine.
