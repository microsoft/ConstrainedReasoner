Israeli forces increased their assault into Gaza on Sunday, expanding the number of air strikes and the number of heavy armored vehicles employed in the combat.
At the same time, President Joe Biden repeated that while Israel had a right to “protect itself,” it also has a responsibility to increase “immediately and significant” humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Hamas’ attacks on Israel killed over 1,400 people; the death count in Gaza of Palestinians is put at over 8,000. United Nations relief operations is taking care of over 600,000 people fleeing the violence.
Rams corralled by Cowboys
The Los Angeles Rams suffered their second consecutive loss on Sunday, falling to the Dallas Cowboys 43-20 in Arlington.
Led by Dak Prescott, who passed for 304 yards and four touchdowns, the Cowboys built a 33-9 halftime lead and were never challenged after that. Perhaps more painful was the injury to quarterback Matthew Stafford’s thumb on his throwing hand.
Before he left the game, Stafford was 13-for-22 for 162 yards with one score and one interception.
The Rams will be next in action on Sunday, Nov. 11 visiting the Packers in Green Bay.
