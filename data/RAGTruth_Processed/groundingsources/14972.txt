What a cool spot!  Just across the water and friendly staff are awaiting you.  Decent menu for the morning crowd as well.  Pretty busy even on a weekday.  Food and service was great.  Killer spot to take in an enjoyable meal to an adventure in Santa Barbara"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-01-08 23:38:08", "review_text": "Please note: this restaurant is no longer open for business. The phone goes to voice mail and requests you to make a reservation and leave contact info\n\nThey will NOT be returning your call. Kind of irresponsible on their part to not honestly let patrons know that they are no longer open \n\nThe website still lists their hours and indicates that they are active and open \n\nTHEY ARE NEITHER ACTIVE OR OPEN, BUT THEY SURE ARE DISHONEST AND DECEPTIVE!!!!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-12-31 03:34:20", "review_text": "Food and service is solid 5 stars - the pastas were each delicious and compared with some of the best Italian restaurants in NY / SF / LA etc. They clearly care about quality and crafting flavorful dishes. Please keep up that standard. Looking forward to being back any time I'm in the area!!"}]}
