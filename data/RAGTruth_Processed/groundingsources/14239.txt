His crew did an amazing job. We got the tri tip and smoked turkey, garlic mashed potatoes, asparagus, salad with bread, and people won't stop telling me how good the food was. He also served appetizers during cocktail hour. He was super easy going, service was great from beginning to end, made sure everything clicked and was taken care of and looked great. He and his staff were so friendly. He was so organized, professional and completely reliable. Steph will make sure you get exactly what you want. His prices are fair and if you like bbq I totally recommend him in a heart beat. He makes bbq look like fine dining. He's the bbq man!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-09-18 03:28:25", "review_text": "At fairly short notice, we decided on a small family-and-friends celebration for our golden anniversary. Simply Marvelous BBQ, and others, were already booked for the weekend. But reviews indicated Simply Marvelous would also do drop off. They did and they were fabulous. Stephan was a delight to work with. Drop off included setup in our kitchen, they provided serving dishes, utensils and everything promised. They were on time, totally professional and discrete as guests had already arrived. The food was absolutely delicious and generous. We were more than happy and looking for the next excuse to use Simply Marvelous BBQ again. Because they were."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-02-18 04:58:53", "review_text": "I just want to say the Stephan Franklin is just amazing at catering, he just recently catered my daughters wedding at my home and I still hear the raves about his wonderful food and staff, Stephan and his team were such a god send to my family and his food omg is sooo delicious.
