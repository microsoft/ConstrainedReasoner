And I'm super shy and quiet, so that should say a lot about the customer service. Their food was my favorite until I experienced the worst customer service from a girl who worked their. So I was sad because ofc I wouldn't support them again after that.

Also, the last 3 times they didn't have any ribs. I also think that the quality of food you get depends on who's working. I will try again but if they give me stories and crappy food I will not go back ever again."}]}
