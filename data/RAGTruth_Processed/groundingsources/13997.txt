First, I love the concept - chicken strips, cheese fries, even a box that mimics fast-food fried chicken. The main issue is the chicken - which is a big problem since it's the main focus of the restaurant. I don't know who their supplier is but the chicken was definitely suffering from Woody breast. Look this up if you're not familiar. It was chewy and stringy and tough. You can even tell when you tear it apart with your fingers that something was wrong. The coating didn't adhere and the pieces were so thick and the coating was so thin (and flaky) that there was not much flavor. You had to dunk the strips in sauce to get any flavor. My partner and I both requested 1 sauce with our meals and we got none. My favorite part was probably the cheese sauce. I love cheese fries so it was nice to find a place that serves them. But even they were not great. You get so little fries in a combo (equivalent to a McDonald's small) and the cheese sauce was lukewarm. If they can't pull off this one item, maybe this location should switch back to a Kyle's Kitchen and serve burgers and salads."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-13 03:34:13", "review_text": "I really don't like giving out reviews and normally don't do so. But this was just crazy, I got into the store and just ordered a Nashville hot chicken meal. Was probably waiting a good 15 minutes and saw people after people go get there food. I finally go up to the counter to ask what's happening and get told sorry and that they were working on the order now.   5 minutes later I see a bag on the counter and go up again to finally get my food. Not only did it take a long time but when it was ready, nothing was said about it."}]}
