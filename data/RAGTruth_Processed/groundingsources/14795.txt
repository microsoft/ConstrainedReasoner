It's obvious the quality of food isn't too great, especially the meats because it tends to be weirdly chewy and full of fats. It doesn't help that the portions are small and the dishes are expensive. It's a quick fill for authentic Asian food in IV if you are craving Asian food but to be honest, the food isn't worth the price."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2017-06-10 20:30:08", "review_text": "I came here listening to the reviews saying this is authentic Chinese.  Well I got what I wanted, a real third-world country style service and food I couldn't bring myself to finish.  I've been to China and this compares to the worst restaurants I tried while there.  Guaranteed authentic Chinese diarrhea"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2017-05-23 01:17:30", "review_text": "They always take tooooooo long.
