{"question": "how to make hot water heater circulate", "passages": "passage 1:For a modest sized pump, this might be 400 to 800 KWH a year if the pump runs all the time. Heat loss from the pipe. Whenever the two pipes are hot, they will be losing heat. This heat comes from the hot water tank, and the water heater must use more fuel to provide the heat.\n\npassage 2:When a homeowner turns on a faucet, the cooled water sitting in the pipes circulates to the faucet first, so the homeowner has to wait for hot water. A hot water circulation pump sends cool water in the pipes back to the water heater through a return line. A pump circulates this water through the water heater as needed to keep it hot. This continuous loop of water through the water heater ensures that hot water is always available.\n\npassage 3:Instead, recirculating pumps rapidly pull hot water from a water heater, while simultanously send cool water from the hot water lines back to the water heater to be reheated and reused. Demand systems can be controlled by the push of a button, a timer, or motion sensor.\n\n"}
