The shop seem clean/sleek but borderline cold/not homey. The atmosphere seems very study worthy. \n\nThe dirty chai was not my preferred sweetness level but my be good for those who like a more spicy chai. The hazelnut latte was refreshing but I couldn't taste the hazelnut all the much. The chocolate chunk cookie was decent, more of a subtle sweet, nothing special."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-13 22:12:26", "review_text": "This shop is super clean and well organized. Great atmosphere for studying due to it being extremely quiet. The iced hazelnut latte lacked the hazelnut flavoring which was disappointing, but still not bad. I asked the cashier for her personal recommendation and she did not disappoint! She recommended an iced coconut/vanilla coffee with oat milk and it was so good! You could really taste the coconut. By far my favorite drink I tasted today. The dirty chai was good but it was very strong and kinda of bitter. Overall it's a cute coffee shop with very nice staff and a cute atmosphere"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-13 17:50:47", "review_text": "My go to coffee shop in Goleta! I've tried a few different flavors of their latte with oat milk and thought they were all delicious, including their Lori's Vietnamese iced coffee. The coffee shop is super spacious with lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The staff is always so friendly and helpful - highly recommend Dean for your next coffee craving."}]}
