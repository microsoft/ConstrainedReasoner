I came here for a quick drink for lunch and got a large Jasmine milk tea with boba. The staff there hooked up a good amount of boba without any extra charge. I was sooo surprised! I didn't have to worry about running out of boba before finishing the tea. \n\nThe jasmine milk tea was amazing. It had just the right amount of sweetness and tea flavor. It did not taste watered down whatsoever. I am definitely coming back here for some more milk tea boba soon."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2019-09-30 06:19:14", "review_text": "Well the milk tea is nice, but it cost us some time to get our drinks.
