The workers here are always welcoming and they are also very fast! \n\nI ordered adobada, cachete, and veggie tacos. I've tried the chicken fajita, asada, and lengua tacos in the past as well. ALL of their tacos are super yummy! \n\nI love ordering my tacos with a side of grilled onions. They're really tasty, and are amazing with the tacos. \n\nThe salsa bar is great, and I love that it is always stocked with limes, cilantro, and everything else that is essential for tacos. \n\nI love Lilly's!!!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-10 03:46:07", "review_text": "You can never go wrong coming here! It is my favorite taco spot in Santa Barbara hands down: great prices, great flavor, and super quick. My favorites are the beef cheek, adobada and tongue, but theres no wrong choice here and even a vegetarian option! I always leave wishing I had more room for one more taco. \n\nI take all of my friends visiting SB here and everyone loves it. I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't been."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-06 18:53:59", "review_text": "Lily's tacos is by far one of the best cheap tacos here in Santa Barbara!
