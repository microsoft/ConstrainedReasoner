I'm not that picky with my service, but this was honestly terrible. Our server took 15 minutes to get us water, another 10 to take our order. And maybe 30 minutes to actually receive our food. Our waiter forgot to grab the correct drinks and didn't take down our orders right. The waiter didn't put down one of the pizzas on our order, so we had to remind him once all the other members got their food. By the time we finished our meals, that pizza was still not at the table. We also found hair baked into our bread, and another in one of our pastas. He also never grabbed our check, he just stared at it and then left. We had to call him back over to take it. The waiter was extremely unapologetic and almost seemed completely lost at what he was supposed to be doing. The only reason there is 2 stars is because the manager was extremely sweet and apologetic, she comped the late pizza, gave us a second, and comped the pasta with the hair in it. Overall, good food, bad service."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-12 01:39:14", "review_text": "Service was excellent and I got a free pizza for being a veteran.
