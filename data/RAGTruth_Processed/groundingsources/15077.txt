If they don't have drivers they should make a note or put a wait time. 30 min on prep and out for delivery now and still says in quality check. I went to the store to possibly pick it up but it was already out for delivery. I came back home and the pizza is still not here!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-05-22 03:11:42", "review_text": "Terrible, just terrible. I know it's fast food, but this location just doesn't care. Food is not cooked, it arrives late and they lie through the tracker. Just skip this location."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-01-18 01:11:34", "review_text": "I enjoy Domino's Pizza but this is not the location to order from. The last couple times I've ordered from the Patterson location there have been mistakes in my orders e.g. giving me a smaller pizza than I ordered (and paid for), not giving me sauces that I paid for, etc. Funny how these mistakes are always in the direction of ripping off the customer.\n\nI recommend you order from somewhere else."}]}
