I thought the decor was pleasing, minimalist with soft lighting.\nWe were the only table for almost 1/2 hour, but then a few more small parties arrived and made the place feel almost full. \nCocktails we were expecting up arrived on the rocks (guess that's our bad for assuming, but who defaults to rocks these days?). Still, delicious and creative. On the downside, for a place that is striving for \"gastropub\" the beer offerings are dismal, dismal, dismal. The once spectacular wine list is a shadow of its former self.\nThe \"avocado fries\" which were said to have a \"tempura\" batter were much heavier and fewer than we were hoping for. Liked the \"ketchup\" and overall flavor, but if you're expecting anything like fries you'll be a little let down.\nI had a similar experience as another reviewer re: the sea bass. Seemed like frozen poorly defrosted, or else cooked poorly with a tough, almost jerky-like crust that might have been a sear.  The gnocchi was delicious but needed something else on the plate to cut the weight of it.\nWe liked our server.\nEven with the Axxess deal, we spent a lot for the meal we got."}]}
