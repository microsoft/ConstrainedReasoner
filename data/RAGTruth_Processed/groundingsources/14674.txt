My favorites were the chocolate croissant and the salted chocolate chip cookie. The croissant was crispy on the outside and the inside as so much chocolate swirling and oozing it was definitely different from the others. The cookie also had a well amount of chocolate and crispy edge. I'll definitely come back and try some more goodies and do the sit-down brunch maybe when there isn't a pandemic. Everyone coming in was asking for the ham and cheese croissant and it was sold out early on the weekend, I'll have to try that next time!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-19 17:15:16", "review_text": "Alessia's Patisserie is one of a kind. She has done an outstanding job at putting together the dream cafe she has been preparing for YEARS! It is everything she's spoken of and more. I may be a bit biased, but friends or not, the food, pastries, and atmosphere is incredible! \n\nI've been searching for my go to breakfast/lunch spot since my favorite place closed a few years ago. I have found it!! I live an hour way and make special trips just to eat some of this delicious food And I wouldn't do that for \"ok\" food. It's worth the trip!! I also couldn't be happier to be in support of one of my best friends life dreams. \n\nAlessia is an inspiration and living proof that if you put your mind to something, stay at it even when it's hard, dreams really do come true! I could not be more proud of her and accomplishing her goal. You did it girl!\n\nTo everyone out there, be in support of people who have a dream, set a goal, achieve it, and work their butt off it every darn day! Alessia's Patisserie is worth the stop, even if you just need a nice little treat for you're self, you deserve it!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-19 16:20:45", "review_text": "Alessia is an amazing pastry chef!
