We were just trying to finish a pool game. I work at a restaurant and we could NEVER tell people to leave before closing like that. I understand it is a bar in IV, but we should have been able to have at least 10 more minutes to enjoy our time there. We were not being disruptive or rude. I get wanting to close and go home but your job is to close at 12, not kick people out early for convenience. Unprofessional."}]}
