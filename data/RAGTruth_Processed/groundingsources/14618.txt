I'd say the bourbon one was my favorite. I wasn't a huge fan of the Thai peanut or the Parmesan wings, but the rest that I tried were decent like the chipotle lime, lemon pepper, and cali bbq. I ordered a raspberry coco mead but i guess that didn't have it in stock so the guy behind the counter brought out two different raspberry flavored beers for me to choose from. They also didn't have the chili watermelon boochcraft so we ended up choosing a different flavor. It was pretty cold out, and we asked if the overhead heater could be turned on and the response was that the heaters weren't ready, not sure what that meant, but we just ate our meal without the heater turned on."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 02:11:47", "review_text": "Hidden gem on Milpas! Love coming to this place especially for happy hour. Great outdoor patio seating and nice ambiance. I haven't tried their wings but I really like the sandwiches and tenders.  Great flavor and good crunch to the chicken !"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-11 03:33:31", "review_text": "Sorry... how did person say that it was good?  Paid $41 for 7 chicken wing pieces, 1 honey Thai burrito and fries and 2- 8ozs. Cokes.  Wings were dry . Burrito was overfilled with dry white meat and little slaw.. off balanced. I have 1/2 left of burrito and will give to the homeless."}]}
