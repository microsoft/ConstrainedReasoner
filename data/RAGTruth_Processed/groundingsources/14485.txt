{"question": "home remedies for ear wax removal", "passages": "passage 1:Place a few drops of olive oil on the ear before bedtime. Wait for a few minutes and let the excess oil drop out. Repeat this process in a span of a week sometimes less to help the ear wax go out. Once the ear wax goes out, take it out with the use of clean cotton. Salt Water.\n\npassage 2:3. Baby Oil/Glycerin. Soften the ear wax by putting a few drops of baby oil or mineral oil with the help of a dropper. Let the oil settle in for some time by placing a cotton ball at the ear opening. This prevents oil from oozing out before reaching the ear wax. Take out the cotton ball after some time in order to drain out the extra oil from the ear. Oil helps to soften the impacted ear wax while facilitating the removal of ear wax.\n\npassage 3:To remove excess earwax, warm a small amount of mineral oil, and then lie down so that you can apply a few drops into the ear canal. The warmth of the oil will help soften the wax. Tilt your head to one side to release the mineral oil. You can then use warm water to flush out the oil and softened wax.\n\n"}
