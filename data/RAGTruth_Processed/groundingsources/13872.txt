The Processing Of Work Permits For Migrants Will Continue Even If The Federal Government Shuts Down
Even if the federal government shuts down this weekend, the federal agency in charge of handling work permits and other applications from asylum seekers will continue its work.
The Biden administration declared last week that Venezuelan nationals who entered the US by July 31 will now be included in the pool of migrants eligible for Temporary Protected Status. For thousands of asylum seekers in New York City, this may hasten the process of obtaining work permits.
Jaddou visited the city on Friday to observe how local, state, and federal organizations are handling the influx of migrants there.
She went to the migrant reception center, where federal employees are assisting with outreach to the migrants by handing out fliers and responding to inquiries regarding the application for a work permit. A work authorization support center and an American Red Cross location were also visible to her.
Steps To Speed Up The Work Permits
According to a USCIS representative, the organization has taken steps to speed up the work permit application process, is providing education sessions for immigrants at libraries, and has issued email and SMS alerts to migrants about their eligibility for work permission. Additionally, the organization provides mobile biometric services including fingerprinting.
Jaddou asserts that USCIS is "committed" to completing work permit applications in a 30-day window on average.
More Funds Will Be Required
While USCIS will be able to function during a shutdown thanks to the filing fees involved with various immigration forms, Jaddou claimed Congress should give the organization more funding so it can process more work permits and TPS applications.
We only have a certain amount of money because of the money that individuals give us. It can occasionally be restrictive, Jaddou stated. To be honest, we could accomplish a lot more if Congress supported us.
