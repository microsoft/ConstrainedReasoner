Governor Abbott Bussed Nearly 60,000 Migrants to Sanctuary Cities
Texas continues to bus migrants to sanctuary cities. According to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, he has bussed nearly 60,000 migrants out of border cities that are overwhelmed with the migrants who cross the border.
Governor Abbott said according to a press release on October 20, Texas has bussed the following migrants to sanctuary cities since 2022:
Over 12,500 migrants to Washington, D.C. since April 2022
Over 21,100 migrants to New York City since August 2022
Over 16,500 migrants to Chicago since August 2022
Over 3,200 migrants to Philadelphia since November 2022
Over 4,600 migrants to Denver since May 18
Over 1,000 migrants to Los Angeles since June 14
According to these numbers, Governor Abbott has bussed over 58,900 migrants to sanctuary cities.
At the end of September, Governor Abbott called for a third special session in October for Texas lawmakers.
According to a message on X which is formerly Twitter, Governor Abbott said:
“Texas will use every tool and strategy at our disposal to respond to Biden’s border crisis – including building our own border wall. I added additional border wall funding to the agenda for Special Session #3 to continue our efforts to protect Texans – and Americans.”
In addition, Governor Abbott continues to work on the construction of the border wall. In a recent press release, Governor Abbott said:
“While President Biden refuses to secure the border, Texas has stepped up as the only state in U.S. history to build our own border wall.”
Despite the increase in migrants and fentanyl crossing the southern border, U.S. Congress has done very little.
Then President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are trying to work internationally to support Latin American countries to reduce the number of migrants arriving.
Do you think Texas will bus 100,000 migrants by the end of the year?
