{"question": "how to peel potatoes fast", "passages": "passage 1:Place washed whole, unpeeled potatoes into a pot and cover with cold water. The \u201cshocking\u201d process of going from the hot boiling water to the cold ice water helps release the skin from the flesh and makes the potato quite easy to peel.\n\npassage 2:True the skin comes off fairly easy but it takes so freakin long! Especially if you are peeling a crap load of potatoes. Here is the easiest way (or at least the easiest way I\u2019ve discovered) to peel a cooked potato. Step 1.) Bring a pot of water to a boil. Step 2.) With a knife, score your potatoes all the way around the center. Step 3.) Place your potatoes in the pot and boil for about 15 minutes or so. Step 4.) Prepare a bowl of ice water and place your potatoes in the water. Step 5.) Swish it around for a few seconds just enough so that it\u2019s cool enough to handle. Step 6.) Remove your potatoe from the water and remove the skin.\n\npassage 3:You will need. Step 1 Cut the potato skin Make a cut all around the potato, lengthwise. Try to slice only the skin, not the actual potato. Step 2 Boil it Put the potato in a pot of boiling water. Step 3 Cool it off Plunge the potato in ice water for 10 seconds. The surface of the potato will shrink, while the center remains hot. Step 4 Remove the skin Rub the potato with both hands and watch the skin fall right off.\n\n"}
