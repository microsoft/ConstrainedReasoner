My current room is cramped and dirty--the TV and telephone don't work. They emailed me a request for mini bar items-none are present. The mattress is broken and the rugs are dirty. Not very Belmond.

Front Desk wanted to send an engineer to \"fix the roof\" instead of finding a new room. This place is a disaster."}]}
