In a couple of occasions I've gone there and the person that rings is up has this type of attitude like he is bugged that were there doesn't want to help us with our scan code and gets bothered if I ask if we ask for ranch or anything else. So definitely I need some improvement they need really need to work on their customer service they need to be a little bit more humble and maybe not everyone that goes there gets treated that way but definitely all customers should be treated with kindness and respect."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-11-13 21:52:43", "review_text": "The first time we ordered from here it was really good. Now, not so much. The toppings tasted good but the cheese was barely there. What is pizza without cheese? The gf crust was rolled as thin as a tortilla. I had to roll the slices like a tortilla to eat them as they would not hold the toppings. It was sad pizza."}]}
