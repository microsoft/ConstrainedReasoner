Next time I went to Smart and final and the King Arthur flour is $3.99 regular price. I live in Goleta so next time I went back to Haggens to compare and they had the King Arthur flour for $6.49 with 20% off which is still $5.15. I have been shopping in the same store since the Safeway opened in the 60's but I am done now with this kind of price increase."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-10-26 10:12:53", "review_text": "I decided to give this Haggen location a chance. I walked into an mostly empty store. I notice some items that have been marked down in the deli due to product expiring the same day. I take it up to the register. The store manager was at the register. She refused to honor the discount on the packaging and said it was a mistake. Haggen, you can keep your expired food!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-10-22 07:50:28", "review_text": "Really? I know you're going out of business Haggen but you expect me to pack my own groceries now? \n\nNow, even though I am an educated professional on a 6+ figure salary, I am not above stuffing some groceries in a shopping bag. It's obviously not difficult. However, if you want me to do your job for you, you've got to be nice to me. Last time I was in the store the portly middle aged man just threw my groceries onto the conveyer belt and left them to pile up at the end. He never acknowledged my existence except to grunt the total to me. \n\nYou can either pack my damn groceries or I walk out next time. Not sorry you'll soon be out of a job if that's the level of \"service\" you provide. Pfft."}]}
