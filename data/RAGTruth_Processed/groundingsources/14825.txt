I am not sure how it is at dinner, but for lunch there was no line so it was fast to get a table. The waiter was very thorough and accommodating. Both my friend and I had the blood orange margarita, which was so good because it had a jalape\u00f1o kick! But, don't worry it's not too spicy for anyone that is sensitive to spice, it was just right. \n\nWe both ended up going with the combination plate; me the taco and enchilada and her the taco and tamale. To be honest the only reason why I didn't go with the mahi mahi taco was because it was singular (taco) versus the other tacos were plural in the name (tacos) and so I was expecting to get at least two tacos in the combo. However, only one came so I would ask that the menu be more clear. But, the food was delicious and we even had enough for leftovers. Both plates came with rice and beans too. \n\nThere is an axxess deal for BOGO entree for lunch or dinner as well. So with all the food and drinks we had my friend and I were able to split it evenly for about $24 per person, which I think is a great deal for such a quality food."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-03-08 15:09:08", "review_text": "Delicious food and drinks! Really fast service. Nice location with a nice scenic patio. They have heaters so you don't have to worry about getting cold. I ordered the burrito and my husband got the fajitas, both were delicious! I also got the margarita flight, which I highly recommend. If you're close to Amtrak on state, I would recommend stopping by!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-03-01 05:02:35", "review_text": "Ate at the bar tonight for my friends birthday.
