We grabbed lunch here while working remotely nearby and looking for something healthy we could eat (everything else that turned up in my search with greater than 4 stars was Mexican - not a surprise!). I had a half turkey sandwich with soup, and the half was a generous size. While they have some trendy drink options, the rest of the place is kind of old school vs trendy (in a good way). Great lunch spot!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-30 03:36:57", "review_text": "Love this place! Great sandwiches. The little mart is really cute. The lady taking the orders kinda rushed me. Never toasted the bread but they got everything else right. The pb and j was crazy drippy.

I have avoided coming here because I witnessed an unprovoked PitBull attack on the patio, where the PitBull literally took a huge chunk out of a man's leg. We were all confused, and I'm left traumatized by that experience, with a bloody leg imprinted on my mind every time I see this place. Be forewarned: this is a dog place. Big dog, mean dog, and itty bitty dogs come here with their owners. This spot is very popular around lunch time. The food is slow, so you'll have a lot of folks waiting around for carry out during lunchtime. \n\nIf you order here, you will order at the counter and then they give you a number and will bring out your food. I ordered the OMG sandwich which had grilled chicken chunks on a soft roll, along with a chicken salad. You can do half and half! Which is great to be able to order a balanced meal. \n\nOverall, I'm still scared of the big aggressive dogs that come here but with a little bit of exposure therapy, I can see putting this place into my lunchtime rotation. \n\nThe food is pretty fresh and tasty. The food is affordable. It was worth the wait and....possibly worth the exposure to scary dogs."}]}
