{"question": "meaning of each types of topology network", "passages": "passage 1:1 Linear Bus: If all network nodes are connected to a combine transmission medium that has two endpoints the Bus is Linear. 2  Distributed Bus: If all network nodes are connected to a combine transmission medium that has more than two endpoints created by branching the main section of the transmitting medium.\n\npassage 2:This type of network is also difficult to troubleshoot. For these reasons, this type of topology is not used for large networks, such as those covering an entire building. Star. In star topology, each computer is connected to a central hub using a point-to-point connection\n\npassage 3:Mesh topology introduces the concept of routes. Unlike each of the previous topologies, messages sent on a mesh network can take any of several possible paths from source to destination. (Recall that even in a ring, although two cable paths exist, messages can only travel in one direction.) Some WANs, most notably the Internet, employ mesh routing.\n\n"}
