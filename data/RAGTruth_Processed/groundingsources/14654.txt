Visited this taco place recently and the quality of the food remains excellent. I value this restaurant's consistency to freshness and flavor. They make your food upon order. I had the chorizo and egg burrito and 3 tacos: grilled fish, asada and marinated pork. They came with a side of fresh chopped cilantro, onions, tomatoes and limes. Everything was perfectly delicious with the red and green salsas. By far the best place for tacos in the Carpinteria/Santa Barbara/Goleta area!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-09-04 21:21:53", "review_text": "Tacos Don Roge is fast and relatively inexpensive. With that said the food is less than memorable.  I ordered Tacos and they were the smallest tacos you've ever seen and were just meet and tortilla... Nothing else.  We also ordered a chicken quesadilla that was just ok, the chicken didn't taste fresh."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-08-31 23:50:38", "review_text": "We ordered a few burritos for lunch and although they weren't the best burritos as they were lacking flavor, they filled up our group and the ingredients were fresh. The beans are fresh and not from a can, the guacamole is legit, so no trace without and order."}]}
