Interior atmosphere is run-of-the-mill, but window tables have great views of the pier and waterfront. Ordered crab cakes for app and thought they were excellent. Ordered ahi salad with the mango relish for main and was expecting the usual light ahi tuna salad, but it was big (I did ordered extra tuna, was worth it) and had SO many flavors that mixed really well together without tasting over-seasoned. Loved it. Well priced too."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2017-10-18 02:24:55", "review_text": "Die Auswahl auf der Karte, das Essen selbst, Service und Ambiente waren allesamt gut. \n\nBesonders ansprechend sind individuelle Rezepturen (z.B. Olivenscheiben im Patty des Garden Burgers) und Verwendung von wertigem Geschirr / Besteck / Servietten, was ich in den USA sonst oft sehr vermisse."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-10-16 04:05:03", "review_text": "I was super impressed. We were just wandering tourists and found this gem! Walked in about 4pm Sunday and not much going on and the staff welcomed us like locals. We wanted to see the games and they opened the bar for us. JP was so friendly and suggested their happy hour menu which was perfect and tasty!! Best happy hour ever! Highly recommend this place! Can't wait to come back."}]}
