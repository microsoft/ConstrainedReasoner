TWO LEAGUES ended up with more than one champion (Shutterstock).
The 2023 regular season for area high school football finally drew to a close on Friday. Most teams will put away their helmets but some can look forward to a “second season” of playoffs.
CIF-SS will be posting its brackets and first round matchups on Sunday at 10 a.m. at http://www.cifss.org .
Here’s how it all (mostly) wound up.
Sunset League: Los Alamitos defeated Edison 21-10 to finish – 8-2 overall and champions of the SL. The Chargers are second.
Garden Grove League: A tie for the GGL crown emerged on Friday after Bolsa Grande beat La Quinta 42-35. Rancho Alamitos and Los Amigos each finished in a deadlock for first at 4-1 while Bolsa and La Quinta tied for third at 3-2. Six-team leagues usually get three playoff spots, but there could be an at-large slot for this bunch after an unusually strong season.
Big 4 League: Marina is the champion after beating Segerstrom 21-19. Garden Grove (3-7) snapped a five-game losing streak and finished 2023 on a high note by slamming Katella 42-7.
Pac 4 League: Laguna Beach defeated Westminster 42-7, but the Lions will make the playoffs as the second-place team.
Orange League: We don’t have a final score at our deadline of the Western-Anaheim game. A Pioneer win makes them champs, but a Colonist upset would create a tie for the title.
Empire League: Tustin grabbed the crown here with a 49-17 win over Cypress. Pacifica defeated Valencia 19-14 to finish 3-7 overall and 2-3 in league, good for fourth place.
Orange Coast League: In a clash of two school teams that began playing each other in 1916, Orange prevailed over Santa Ana 14-0 and created a three-way tie for first among the Panthers, Saints and St. Margaret’s, all 5-1 in OCL action.
First round games will be played on Friday, Nov. 3. Second round games are Friday, Nov. 10, semifinals on Friday, Nov. 17 and the finals on Nov. 24 or 25 depending on division.
