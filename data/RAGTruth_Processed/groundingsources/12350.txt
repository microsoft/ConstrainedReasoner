{"question": "how to relieve tight calf muscles", "passages": "passage 1:Treatment for Tight Calf Muscles: If a calf cramp or tightness strikes in the middle of a run, stretching the muscle is the best immediate fix. Find a curb and rest the forefoot of the leg that's cramping on the curb. Slowly lower your heel off the curb and hold for 30 seconds. If your calf really starts seizing up, you may need to gently massage the area. After runs, one of the best ways to treat tight calf muscles is to see a sports massage therapist or physical therapist for a deep tissue massage. If you don't have the money or time for professional massages, you can also do self-massage at home using a massage tool such as a massage ball or foam roller.\n\npassage 2:Perform calf raises by first standing with your hands holding the back of a chair or table.
