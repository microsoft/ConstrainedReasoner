Food and service are always on point!\n\nMy husband would eat here every day if we lived there. The enchiladas are amazing, make sure to ask for extra sauce as it's good to dip the chips in.\n\nNice to enjoy there outdoor seating and people watching. \n\nHave a margarita and enchilada and you will be thankful."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-03 17:19:58", "review_text": "Rose caf\u00e9 is one of my favorite spots in town.
