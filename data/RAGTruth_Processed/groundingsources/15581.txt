{"question": "how to make a clay boat buoyant", "passages": "passage 1:1 Repeat step one (you will have to fish out the clay, dry off the tray and refill the bowl), and this time, ask your child to notice how much water drips onto the tray (very little if any). 2  Collect this little bit of water in a clear glass and set it aside. Make sure your tray is once again dry and your bowl is filled up to the brim with water. 2  Have your child place the clay in the water and observe together how much water now drips onto the tray (it should be more this time).\n\npassage 2:A solid chunk of clay, just like a chunk of steel, fiberglass, aluminum or cement, will sink in water. In order to make clay float, you have to shape it into something wide enough and roughly bowl-shaped so that it can displace enough water to compensate for its mass, just like a real boat.at the clay into an even, rectangular flat sheet. The thinner it is, the more buoyant your boat will be. Fold the ends of the boat together to make an enclosed box. It could be rectangular or shaped like a canoe, as long as it has sides that are higher than the bottom. Pinch the ends together to get a tight seal.\n\npassage 3:Buoyant force is the upward force that keeps things afloat. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water the boat displaces. To review buoyancy, have the students explore Buoyancy Basics, on the NOVA Online website.Discuss the diagrams and make sure students understand that the weight of water displaced equals the weight of the wood.ow, distribute the student page Buoyant Boats and the materials listed on that page. Make sure the students understand that they only get one piece of aluminum foil to build the boat. If it tears or gets a hole, they must find a way to repair it.\n\n"}
