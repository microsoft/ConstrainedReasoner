What an incredibly luxurious experience it turned out to be! We are vegetarians and were very pleasantly surprised to find excellent, well thought out options, e.g. black truffle tagliatelle. We are picky eaters, and have sampled the finest vegetarian restaurants in many foodie cities - London, Berlin, Vancouver, etc., so the fact that we loved every course at the Miro says a lot. The service was indulgent and the view unbeatable. Yes, it was expensive, but worth every penny. I would recommend this place for a special occasion because a meal here is very special."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-08-19 22:21:40", "review_text": "Haven't been in a few years but this was memorable.  The wine list here is staggeringly good.  The prices are even reasonable (hopefully still are) given the vintages I had.  \nCame with a few food/wine buddies and went through multiple bottles and several plates during truffle season.  \nGiven that so many places underwhelm in SB this is a major standout."}]}
