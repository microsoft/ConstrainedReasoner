We were the only ones there. Walk in, the guy at the counter asks what we want before we even pick up a menu. First thing I notice is the prices have already been raised from the menu pictures here on yelp by about $2 per sandwich. That's not a good sign considering they've only been opened about 7 weeks. Anyway, I ordered the Santa Maria and my boyfriend ordered the barbecue. We take a seat outside because it was stuffy inside and the tables all needed to be cleaned. We waited a good 20 minutes for our sandwiches to come out... And like I said we were the only ones there. After waiting 20 mins for a sandwich, you're expecting something pretty great. Well we were seriously let down. Thin sliced Tri tip with very little flavor, bread that could have been toasted another full minute, potato chips, and finally some bean liquid with a few beans floating around. Please, please, please, if you're going to specialize in one thing and name your restaurant after it, make sure you have it perfected. Sadly the Tri tip company does not."}]}
