The courtyard is beyond romantic, dining under hundred year old olive trees. Service is superb. Cocktails are beautiful and so good. Food is unbelievably yum, especially the yellowtail tostadas! Can't wait to go back for lunch! A perfect spot for a big party or a romantic date."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-01-31 03:02:23", "review_text": "La Cocina is all the things you look for in a Santa Barbara Mexican restaurant: harnessing the city's natural beauty, Latin elegance, gorgeous local produce behind each dish, outdoor dining in a twinkling light courtyard, unpretentious staff, stiff drinks and a nice wine list. From the minute the salsa comes to the table, you know this is a different experience.  The salsa is fresh, made just moments before, out of ingredients you can't quite pin down because it's nowhere in the ballpark of regular Mexican restaurant salsa. Then the guacamole makes you weep. We ordered the Padron chilies -- blistered and soft and petite which are sprinkled in a creamy poblano sauce. Honestly I can't say enough about the cuisine here.  I even had  a roasted romaine salad who he could have been just pedestrian but in the hands of La Cocina it was elevated with nuts, pepitas, corn and a creamy dressing, became a fantastic entree. I will come back just for that salad. And the peppers. My husband got the ducks de Leche and was blown away. This is my new favorite spot in downtown SB for a chic date night."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-01-28 04:42:51", "review_text": "Met friends and had an exceptional experience.
