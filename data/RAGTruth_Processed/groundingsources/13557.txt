77-Year-Old's Hidden Stash: The Underground Trade of Erectile Drugs in Florida
Illegal Stash Uncovered
In an unexpected revelation, Reginald Kincer, a resident of The Villages in Florida, has been charged with a peculiar crime: stockpiling erectile dysfunction medications with the intent to distribute. At the age of 77, Kincer finds himself under the scrutiny of federal prosecutors who allege that he acquired over $1,800 worth of these drugs without a doctor's prescription.
This rather unusual case came into the limelight after the Department of Homeland Security stumbled upon Kincer's stash during a search of his residence in 2018. While the incident itself occurred a few years ago, the rationale behind Kincer currently facing the charges remains undisclosed.
A Pattern of Drug-related Offenses?
This isn't Kincer's maiden voyage into drug-related offenses. Diving into the past, one can trace a record of a similar arrest in 2020, where he was charged with possessing an assortment of drugs - marijuana, MDMA, and the hallucinogenic psilocybin, to name a few. His previous encounter with the legal system culminated in a guilty verdict in 2021, leading to a three-year probation sentence, as stated in the Sumter County court archives.
Awaiting Trial
As November approaches, so does Kincer's date in court. If the court finds him guilty of his alleged misdemeanors, he could be staring down the barrel of a year-long federal prison sentence, accompanied by a hefty fine of up to $10,000.
This case serves as a stark reminder of the unexpected turns the illicit drug trade can take, shedding light on the lesser-known aspects of the black market and its far-reaching tentacles in communities like The Villages.
