First of all, pasta is one of the cheapest foods for a restaurant to prepare fresh. But at Pasta House, everything is frozen. Can't tell you how many times I've taken home a baked ziti that was rock hard and cold in the middle. And because it isn't fresh, the pasta doesn't really seem to hold up as leftovers in the fridge, usually getting soggy and inedible. \n\nBut wait, there's more! The pricing is just unacceptable, $8-$10 (or more) for one medium-sized serving of pasta which is never a notch above barely mediocre. You are seriously better off buying the ingredients and making it yourself  - it'll cost roughly the same and it'll be fresh, and the cashier won't shamelessly hit on you in an attempt to haggle for tips.\n\nAlso, did I mention that they take forever? That's because they put their frozen iced pasta blocks in the oven to give the impression that it's being cooked fresh. Pasta House, you ain't foolin' nobody. Put it in the damn microwave and save us the dramatics. Or better yet, just make it fresh."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2011-11-15 17:37:42", "review_text": "Pasta House disappointed--long wait 20-30 minutes & very sub par food--very spicy marinara, & bland veggies. A decent portion for the price, but i'd rather get a small amount of good than a large amount of mediocre bordering on bad..let's just say I could have done better myself. But I did like the garlic bread."}]}
