Last night my husband and I went back to Santa Barbara to celebrate New Year's eve. We of course went to Madison's for their amazing happy hour specials, but just to remember the good old days of living in Santa Barbara. We enjoyed our beverages, and then before leaving discovered I lost my id somewhere, I mentioned to the waitress that I might have lost it here, gave her my number if by some miracle they found it and went onto our next location. I never thought I would hear from them, as more than likely I dropped it in one of a million places. This morning at 9 am, I got a call from Heather the manager to let me know they have it and will send it my way. Wow!! Great food, great deals and people that actually care about their customers enough to call them the next morning. We will happily be going there again!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2011-12-29 06:02:49", "review_text": "food was nothing special, hard to hear any of the  tvs over the noise, bartenders in my opinion were some of the worst i ever had( to worried about the girls coming in and not the patrons !!) . i had to wait 30 mins!! thats right !! for one of the bartenders to ask me if i wanted  another beer.. hey i understand the girls here are HOTT but dude im spending MONEY!! i think their boss would agree..only went once here and will not go back when im in town.. sorry"}]}
