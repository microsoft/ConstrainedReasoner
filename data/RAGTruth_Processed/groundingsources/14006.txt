Food was great -- salad, pizza, and gelato. All great. \n\nThey warned us that it would be hard to get pizzas out for that large a crowd, and they were right. But they did the best they could in the situation and everyone was happy. Their chefs worked hard to please and did a great job. \n\nOnly negatives were: underestimated salad, so we ran out a little early. And Email response was a little slow. That said, a pleasure to work with and tasty food!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-07-25 22:35:25", "review_text": "California Wood-Fired Catering is delicious and perfect for a casual, fun event! I have had the pleasure of working with them many times for events at the private event venue that I manage. While I have heard from a few clients that the owner can be sometimes difficult to get a hold of, I myself have never had a problem reaching him by calling the number listed on their website. Either way they always come through with the events that they book and the guests always rave about how fun it is having a wood-fired burning oven popping out fresh pizzas as well as how delicious the food is."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2013-07-06 04:21:37", "review_text": "This year for 4th of July we checked out the Stow House old fashioned 4th of July:) What a pleasant surprise.
