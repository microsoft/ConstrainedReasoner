I have tried lobster roll from several places, but this place was the best of the best! The taste was just spot on and the lobster was so fresh! Absolutely a must-try when you got a chance to pass by Santa Barbara. It was quite a hassle to find a table since this place is crowded all the time, but well, nothing can stand between me and that absolutely delightful lobster roll"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-11-19 23:57:52", "review_text": "The meal that I had at Broad Street was amazing! The place was a little hard to find because it was crammed in the middle of two stores but WOW. This restaurant had so much love from the employees and chefs I knew that the food was gonna be good. We ordered the lobster roll with potato chips on the side, when our food came we couldn't have enough of it. First off the bread had so many flavors coming in at once like the butter made the bread soft every time you would take a bit your teeth would sink into soft buttery goodness. The lobster was so good to mix with the bread as well with its soft texture in every bite I couldn't get enough of it the lobster had the right seasonings on and everything. When I tried the chips I thought to myself that the chefs know what they where doing. I loved the chips it had a crunch in every bite with the seasoning it added even more flavor than I could handle. This place was the best restaurant to go to that you can't stop eating it I really recommend if you want lobster."}]}
