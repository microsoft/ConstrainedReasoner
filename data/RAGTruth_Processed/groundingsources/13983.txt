MAHANOY CITY â€“ Mahanoy Area and Tri-Valley exchanged the lead at least four times before a winner was decided Friday on Homecoming night in Mahanoy City.
A 52-yard run by senior running back Colm McGroarty put Mahanoy Area on the board first early in the 1st quarter.

Senior quarterback Blake Schwartz found Hunter Troutman for a go-ahead touchdown with about two minutes left in the half, followed by a successful two point conversion.
A Trey Porter interception for Tri-Valley ended a Mahanoy drive at the very end of the half to give Tri-Valley the 14-7 advantage into the halftime break.
McGroarty would find paydirt again early in the third quarter with a 26-yard run, but a failed point-after kept Tri-Valley ahead 14-13.
He would put Mahanoy ahead a few minutes later with an explosive 61-yard score, and a failed two-point conversion put Mahanoy ahead 19-14.
Standout sophomore Cole Gemberling scored on a 9-yard run for Tri-Valley to put the Dawgs back in front, 20-19.
With 7:25 left to play, Mahanoy junior quarterback Levi Terry connected with senior wideout Ethan Manley to retake the lead for good at 27-20.
The Bears held of the Bulldogs for the remainder of the game, including a hail mary attempt with 1.5 seconds left.
Mahanoy improves to 2-6 with the victory while Tri-Valley falls to 4-4.
