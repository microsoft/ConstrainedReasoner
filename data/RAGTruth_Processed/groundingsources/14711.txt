She has her good days and she certainly had her bad days. I will give them this though, their brunch on the weekends was top tier. During my CHI-5 freshman year my friends and I would commute to Carrillo for Sunday brunch (we were very late risers so it was that serious). Nothing in all of the UCSB dining halls outbeats the egg station. Chefs kiss. Anyway I appreciated their multicultural days once a quarter. Furthermore, their fruit selection was always better than Ortega and DLG. The froyo is either a hit or miss. Once they had red bean and black sesame and me and all the intl girls were here for it, but sometimes they had REDBULL flavor during midterm season...yikes...but all said, Carrillo is pretty standard."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-10-13 04:30:15", "review_text": "The food is alright.\n\nThe staff is another story. The ones who act up are sad losers with nothing else to look forward to in life but harass others for no reason. I personally had a bad experience with the staff, I do not think I am the only one who had this issue. I was walking back to the water bottle station at around the end of operating hours (no students in the building). My hands were full with empty paper plates that they make us throw away on the other side of the building and i had just finished eating, so my mask was off. Instantly after getting up and walking to the water station, two workers started yelling at me and cornered me (1-2 feet apart) into the side of the water bottle filling station. Keep in mind no one was around me besides my two other friends, they left their workstations, went across the room to yell at me.\n\nThey called me demented (while i was filling up my water bottle) said that we were in a pandemic for 18 months and that I didn't care, all the while ironically not enforcing their own rules (i have seen them without their masks multiple times). If they truly cared about the pandemic they would certainly wash the self serve handles after every use, maintain 6 feet social distance and enforce people to use hand sanitizers and wash hands. The reality is that they enjoy going out of their way to yell at students because they have sad depressing lives and have no sense of politeness or moral decency. Who calls a student demented. This isn't an isolated incident, something needs to be done about this issue."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-04-26 20:38:42", "review_text": "great burgers at the grill , and the cream cheese brownies are delicious ! also the employee at salad, the girl wearing glasses named Alex, was great at helping me , super nice, and overall made me feel welcome my first year at UCSB. i will be visiting salad again because i am vegan! glad to have that employee always helping me. the other employees are also nice but not as helpful. salad is my favorite!!"}]}
