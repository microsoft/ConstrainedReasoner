A: Metals containing iron, such as most kinds of steel, will rust when exposed to air and water. Rust is just iron oxide, usually with water molecules incorporated in it too. It usually takes the form of an orange powder on the surface of the metal.Other metals oxidize or form other compounds in a similar way, although we usually say they corrode. Rusting is a specific kind of corrosion which applies to iron-containing metals. Rusting has a number of effects on metal objects.It makes them look orange and rough. It makes them weaker, by replacing the strong iron or steel with flaky powder.ust ask someone who has tried to get a rusty nut unstuck from a rusty bolt. Rust can make holes in sheet metal. Rusty car mufflers sometimes develop holes in them, and the sheet steel making the outer bodies of cars will often rust through, making holes. Rust is a lot less magnetic than iron.\n\n"}
