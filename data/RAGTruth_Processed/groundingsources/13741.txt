The foie gras was the best I've ever eaten! And the steak with chantrells was heavenly!  Kudos to this new chef, Chef Moissin!!!  Thanks for making our Thanksgiving dinner so awesome!

From the greeting at the door, to the service, the cocktails, the meals, it was excellent. Can't wait to go back for dinner on a non holiday. FYI the picky eater ate every single bit of his Turkey dinner... the lobster risotto was flawless with the fish course."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-11-11 03:48:11", "review_text": "I got the Pecan crusted halibut and it was amazingly scrumptious delicious awesomeness.   Whatever the buttery sauce was that comes with it literally made fireworks go off inside of me when I ate it.  \n\nMy wife had the Kansas City strip steak and it also was really good.  Her sauce was a red wine reduction and it was also incredible.  \n\nWe had the Parker station Pino Noir red wine and it was smooth and delicious."}]}
