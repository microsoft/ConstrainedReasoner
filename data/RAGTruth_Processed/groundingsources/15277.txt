{"question": "how does a pressure tank work", "passages": "passage 1:How Does a Well Tank Work? There are various designs of well tanks, but the basic principle is quite simple: there is pressurized air on the top of the tank and a reservoir of water on the bottom. As the water pump fills the reservoir with water, it compresses the air on the top. When the pressure gets to around 50psi, a switch turns the pump off. Then, as the water is used, the compressed air pushes the water out of the tank. When the pressure drops to around 30psi, the pump switches back on and the cycle repeats itself.\n\npassage 2:Your well tank is under a lot of pressure to perform. There are various designs of well tanks, but the basic principle is quite simple: there is pressurized air on the top of the tank and a reservoir of water on the bottom. As the water pump fills the reservoir with water, it compresses the air on the top.\n\npassage 3:This is where air is pumped into the tank. The air valve on some tanks is in a different place, so you may have to look for it. In older Amtrol tanks, the air valve is located inconveniently on the bottom of the tank. When the RO tank is empty of water, it should have a pressure of five to 10 psi air. As water is forced into the tank by operation of the RO unit, pressure inside the tank increases.\n\n"}
