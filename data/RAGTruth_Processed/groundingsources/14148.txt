I think he is refusing to give me another drink refill. Not even if I pay for it. I thought I was minding my business after eating lunch. I guess he is too busy with his other duties of standing around the drink machine doing nothing. \n\nFortunately, McDonald's is a couple of blocks north and Habit (which is actually pretty good) is a couple of blocks south, so it is not hard to find a place where people want to work."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-01-14 06:09:11", "review_text": "This is one of the best Carl's jrs I've been to.
