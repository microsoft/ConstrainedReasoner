The first couple experiences were great. The food was tasty and left me craving more! But last night I ate the pastor nachos and my boyfriend had the pastor burrito, and unfortunately we are both trying to recover from food poisoning. We both had pleasant experiences the first couple times, but now I don't think I can look at this food truck the same way again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-21 23:07:36", "review_text": "My coworkers and I stopped by here for lunch only to find the truck window closed. However, as we were leaving the owner walked up and offered to cook us something despite being closed for the day. We all ended up ordering a variety of mulitas - it was my first time trying them and they were delicious (a bit like a quesadilla but with small tortillas sandwiching the fillings); the meats and salsas were all on point. Mostly I appreciated the kindness and hospitality we received here!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-03-20 20:51:18", "review_text": "This food is amazing! We stopped 2 days in a row and ordered different items... Everything we ordered from tacos to the burgers was excellent!! BBQ burger & birria tacos!!!"}]}
