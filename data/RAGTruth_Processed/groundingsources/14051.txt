The bouncers were incredibly rude and saying disturbing things to me. I left the bar and had come back for them to give me a hard time about coming in again. I asked for their names and they responded \"I don't have to tell you shit\". Worst night of my life. I went home crying after the horrible stuff that was said to me.  I will never be coming here again or recommending this place to anyone. If you enjoy bouncers taking advantage of you and their job then this is the place to go. Sharkeez right next door was way more accommodating, if your looking for a safe bar with friendly people, I would recommended Sharkeez."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-15 17:44:26", "review_text": "My son was a groomsman at a wedding in Santa Barbara on October 10, 2021, a Sunday night.  After the reception, around 11:30 pm, a couple of the guests went to O'Malleys for a drink.  My son's bar bill was $40 and he added a $15 tip.  O'Malleys' added $400 to his credit card for a total of a $455 charge.  This is FRAUD and THEFT.  I called OMalleys' numerous times, leaving a name and phone number since they don't answer their telephone - with no reply.  I am shocked and dismayed by this outright theft.  DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS BAR, their employees are dishonest and thieves."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-11 23:42:10", "review_text": "I know, I know.... People might be shocked to see that O'Malley's gets a five star rating from me.   More on that later.  \n\nO'Malley's is hard to categorize which I believe is the reason it is not carrying a higher Yelp rating.   I would describe it as a \"neighborhood bar located at ground zero of tourist central\".  Some would call it a dive bar, it isn't.   I am a bit of a dive bar connoisseur and O'Malley's falls short or more accurately elevates above the standard of dive bar.   Mostly for the lack of bar flys sitting at the counter at 11:00am.  \n\nThey have an amazing team, many who have worked here for years and are loved by SB locals.   Duane and Katie are fabulous and today as I write this Haley is working!   She just made me an amazing margarita.  \n\nNow, why five stars? Because I come here so freakin' much.   How could I ever knock off a star for a place I frequent many times in a month.  SB falls short in the sports bar department and O'Malleys has TV's in abundance!  Inside, on the patio and now out front on State Street.   Whether you love football, Dodger games or European Soccer they have it on.   If you are visiting SB you might have noticed it is not uncommon to pay $16 for a drink, not O'Malley's, I don't know how many times I got my bill and said \"we ordered five drinks\" and heard them respond \"yes, they are all on there\".  As a tourist you might find O'Malley's to be a little unkept for the fancy SB vibe you are used to, but come back on your next visit, and then your next.   I'm sure you will embrace it as I do."}]}
