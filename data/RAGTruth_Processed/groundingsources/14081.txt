When I was a kid we'd often come here for family dinners. We always had a great time and the food was tasty. We call their chicken soup \"sick soup\" and request it every time we have a cold or flu. It used to be delicious. (Even though they've always used frozen veggies and the chicken is terribly dry). This place has gone so far downhill in the past years. There is no flavor. It's about as Americanized as it can be, maybe dumbed down for SB's growing intolerance for spice. This is as close to Mexican food as the $2 tacos from Jack in the box."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-28 01:37:48", "review_text": "So so so good. Traveling from Austin, TX and naturally wanted some Mexican food with my family. Service was amazing, very kind employees. I did not catch her name but the employees was helpful & always made sure our chips were refilled. It was very good! Throughout the whole meal my family and I kept commenting on how good the food was. Thank you!!!"}]}
