No wonder it closed the owner has no knowledge of how to run a food business.

Another plus point is the type of food. You can get kebab (lamb, beef, chicken) at very reasonable price. \n\nThey can improve their professionalism. You might face a significant waiting time. But the guys who own the place are very nice and welcoming!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2017-08-16 04:25:27", "review_text": "Have to disagree with rave reviews on this one. We were shown a menu and then told they only had about half of the items. Then picked something and were told they didn't have that either. Ended up ordering chicken, lamb, and beef. It took about twenty or twenty five minutes. We ate outside because the interior is so dreary and stuffy. Our order was correct. Food was acceptable but not anything I'll go back for."}]}
