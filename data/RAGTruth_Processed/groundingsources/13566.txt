'Bold and the Beautiful' Spoilers: Lauren Visits LA, Will She Finally Learn Sheila Carter Is Alive?
The Bold and the Beautiful (B&B) spoilers tease that Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E Bregman) will stop by Los Angeles for a visit on Friday, October 27. Soap Opera Digest reports Lauren will only be in LA for one episode and head back to Genoa City.
Lauren plans to attend the fashion showdown between Eric Forrester (John McCook) and Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye). Being a fashion designer based in Genoa City, she wants to support her friends in the battle for the best designs.
With Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) alive and well, surely someone will mention Lauren's former nemesis to her. Until now, no one has called Lauren to deliver the crushing news that Sheila was never attacked by a bear and is alive. Not only that, Lauren could learn Deacon is in a relationship with the monster. Considering all the years Sheila was obsessed with Lauren and her then-husband, Scott, you would think someone would give her the heads up.
It's possible that the whole purpose of Lauren's crossover to The Bold and the Beautiful is to learn the scoop about Sheila. Perhaps she can talk some sense into Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) and get him to leave her in the dust.
The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say Lauren's crossover to B&B will be action-packed, ending in the designer learning shocking news. It points to Lauren learning Sheila is alive. It's possible the upsetting news could be related to Eric's health crisis.
