Prince William's "Outrage" Against Prince Harry over Netflix's Exploitation of the Royals
Prince Harry's Media Deals: A Thorn in the Royal Family's Side
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is reportedly incensed over his brother Prince Harry's ongoing association with Netflix, the platform accused of "ruthlessly exploiting" the Royal Family.
This information comes from a close friend of the Prince of Wales, who spoke to The Daily Beast under the condition of anonymity.
The tension between the brothers has been exacerbated by the upcoming release of the sixth and final season of The Crown, a highly successful Netflix drama that chronicles the lives of the British Royal Family.
The series, set to be released in two parts on November 16 and December 14, has been a source of contention for its depiction of sensitive royal events.
The forthcoming season is expected to portray the tragic death of Princess Diana, their mother, in a car crash in Paris. William reportedly finds the repeated exploitation of his mother's memory by Netflix "incredibly hurtful".
Adding to the complexity of the situation, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle have been forging their own path in the entertainment industry since their dramatic departure from the Royal Family in 2020.
Their portfolio includes a number of lucrative deals, notably with Netflix and Spotify. Their work for Netflix includes the controversial documentary Harry & Meghan, which broke streaming records despite the personal allegations made against Harry's relatives.
Their most recent project, Heart of Invictus, follows competitors in the Invictus Games 2022 and their challenges during the Paralympic-style sporting event. However, the couple's ventures into the entertainment world have not been without controversy, as their Spotify partnership ended after just one series of Meghan's podcast Archetypes.
The Crown's final season will cover events up until 2005, meaning Harry and Meghan's relationship, which began in 2016, will not be depicted.
Nevertheless, the show's portrayal of the Royal Family continues to stir up strong emotions, especially in the wake of Harry and Meghan's departure and subsequent media deals.
