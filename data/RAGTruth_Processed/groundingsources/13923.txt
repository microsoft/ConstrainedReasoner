Disney World To Hike Prices, Bring Back All-Day Park Hopping
Walt Disney World is upping its ticket and parking prices again, but will soften the blow a bit by bringing back the popular All-Day Park Hooping to its vast resort.
The annual pass prices at Walt Disney World skyrocketed in every pass category, even for Florida residents. That pass, the Disney Pixie Dust Pass, will now cost Sunshine State residents $439 ($21.88 per month excluding taxes), a $40 increase. Meanwhile, for park goers who want a more inclusive experience in the parks, the Disney Incredi-Pass, their highest-tiered pass, went up by $50, from $1,449 to $1,449 (or $111.52 per month).
Parking at the House of the Mouse will also be a little more expensive. Prices at Walt Disney World will increase $5, to $30, which, according to UPI News, will bring its parking prices more in line with Orlando’s other giant theme park resorts. To make up for the increase in ticket prices, the company is bringing back All Day Park Hopper Access to annual pass holders.
According to its Disney Parks blog, starting on January 9th, annual pass holders will now be able to visit any of Disney World’s parks at any time of the day during operating hours. Currently, Park Hopper Access is only available after 2 p.m. Other changes being made for annual passholders include a return to complimentary self-parking at all Disney World Resort hotels, and the return of parking trams, which were halted during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The raise in ticket and parking prices comes as The Walt Disney Company is preparing to spend over $60 billion in its parks over the next 10 years, which also includes the company’s overseas theme parks and the Disney Cruise Line.
