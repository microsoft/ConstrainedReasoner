Has both indoor and outdoor seating - we sat in the front patio!\nCame in on a Monday as a first timer. I got recommended by a fellow Yelp Elite to try the place out after expressing interest in good appetizers at Finney's. I would say you'll miss out if you don't get the buffalo cauliflowers here, and I'm not even a big fan of the buffalo flavor itself. Crunchy, flavorful, with the perfect steam inside. \nFor entree I ordered the grilled fish tacos with French fries (should have gotten their potato chips instead I ended up stealing a bunch off my friend's plates!) Fish tasted fresh, but there was no flavor. I immediately ate a buffalo cauliflower to make sure I didn't have a sudden onset of covid that could have taken my taste away haha. This order was underwhelming, maybe I should have gotten battered fish instead of grilled?\nThe best part was dessert. Get the flan! It was delicious, I mean it's flan. Can't go wrong here. \nOverall, GOOD place for American eats."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 03:47:10", "review_text": "Food is good and service is okay. We like the fish tacos and recommend today's special Halibut. The Ahi Poke Nachos is a good appetizer too."}]}
