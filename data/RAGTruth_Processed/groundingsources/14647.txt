I am giving it 4 stars for the food taste. I will not dock any points for how long it takes for the food to actually be done and served as I think the taste makes up for it. I had a lasagna there before and it was absolutely delicious (think it took about 1/2 hour or so to make which I think is a typical amount of time to make lasagna but for a lunch time where I have to return to work, it is a bit long compared to some other places but as I said, the taste makes up for it). I also had a couple of pizzas there on a separate occassion and they were done quite well. There's not much space in there so if you have a party of like 10+ people, you will potentially have to combine some tables assuming they are not already taken. I would say this is a hidden gem as the spot is a bit hidden away between santa barbara chicken ranch and panda express, both where the food can be obtained at a significantly faster speed. In any case, I would surely come back again (when I am not in a rush)."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2013-06-21 22:57:00", "review_text": "This place is hidden down an alley, which seems to keep the crowds out. Very tasty and unique pizzas and a few good beers on tap. Solid place for a reasonable priced meal."}]}
