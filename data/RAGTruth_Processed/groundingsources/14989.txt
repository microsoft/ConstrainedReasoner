I bet everyone else was at crowded breakfast/brunch locations that had a wait. Don't sleep on going to a sports bar for a meal and fun. \nThey have TVs galore featuring all of your favorite teams, Food, and an excellent selection of drinks.\nIt has a sugar skull theme and I simply adore sugar skulls.\nThey serve Mexican food and other type of American food. Plenty of choices for everyone.\nI had shrimp tacos with my favorite \"black beans\".\nMy hubby had boneless chicken wings and a carne asada burrito.\nOur friends had tacos and nachos. Overall all the food was good but the chicken nachos were so bomb especially the presentation.\nAll in all we had a great time and once again I totally love the sugar skull decor/theme. I'm not even a fan of sports but I enjoyed myself immensely. I also saw families with young children and everyone was chill so I do recommend it for families. Feel free to come here and chill and dress up in your favorite team attire.\nSo long till next time"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-28 02:42:21", "review_text": "For the 3rd time that I order from Sharkeez and either my dam order the messed up orrrrrr my dam order doesn't come. So now I have to seat here and order from somewhere else and wait another hour to eat. That is ridiculous, & I'm tired of it. Get it together!!!! I'm tired of wasting my money on this restaurant. Never again!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-10-27 05:37:59", "review_text": "Not what we expected. The hot wings were below standard, too much batter and not cooked to standard. 4 wings were fused together making a \"wing cluster.\" The flavor was ok. Never again."}]}
