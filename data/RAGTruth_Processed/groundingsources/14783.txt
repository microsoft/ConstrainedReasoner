My recent visit: My bowl was practically half full which it usually is not because I order the same thing every time. I pay more for extra steak and there was BARELY any. For all chipotle lovers like myself, I HIGHLY recommend that you dodge this location. They are extremely stingy with their servings. However, the chips were fine, the bowl was devastating."}]}
