The bread is amazing. Love the pickled pinions. All the food is amazing. Cute little shop with awesome Hugh quality items. I bought a Frama shampoo and conditioner and love them.  Great stop on a drive up the 101 as well. Seating outside as well. Highly recommend."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-06-20 22:05:50", "review_text": "Stopped by on our way to Solvang from Glendora, needed a pick me up after 3 hours on the road with our 7 and 3 year old. We got 2 warm freshly baked chocolate chip cookies which were eaten immediately by the kids, and two Cowboy cookies which were very satisfying!\n\nWorst! Coffee! EVER!!!!\n\nYOU GUYS NEED TO CALL KLATCH COFFEE and ask them how to make coffee. My husband, who is NOT AT ALL picky about coffee even said it was one of the worst hes ever had. He prefers the mochas, which tasted like nestle syrup. I had a regular latte and it didnt taste anything like espresso. Im so bummed."}]}
