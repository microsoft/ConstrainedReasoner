Even with the steady decline of the American shopping mall, Paseo Nuevo sure can hold its own. \n\nThe mall received a high-budget refresh and looks great. I feel that although the before version was just fine, a fresh coat of paint and new paver pathways (among other enhancements) really brought this place into the current decade. \n\nNo matter which corner of Paseo Nuevo you happen to be at, you're sure to be in for a treat. The mall is adorned with beautiful plants and ornate ironwork, and I feel that most every shop is occupied which is a welcome change to vacant State Street. You'll find all types of small boutiques and little cafes here for your enjoyment. While the two anchor retail stores no longer occupy the mall, there's talk that one of them will be transitioning to a roller rink which I look forward to seeing. \n\nA great plaza overall. The American mall is not dead!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-09 03:33:11", "review_text": "Everything closes at 7pm?! Everyday. Even weekends.
