{"question": "which organs are in which quadrants", "passages": "passage 1:Right Lower Quadrant. The right lower quadrant contains the large and small intestines, the appendix and in female patients, the ovaries. Physicians listen for the normal sounds of the bowel; any increased or decreased sounds may indicate bowel abnormalities including infection or obstruction.\n\npassage 2:The right upper quadrant (RUQ in the illustration) contains very significant organs, or at least portions of them. Within this quadrant you'll find the right portion of the liver, the gallbladder, right kidney, a small section of the stomach, part of the colon, and sections of small intestine.\n\npassage 3:The left upper quadrant (LUQ) contains similar organs to the RUQ. In the LUQ you'll find the left portion of the liver, the majority of the stomach, pancreas, left kidney, spleen, portions of the colon, and (again) parts of the small intestine.\n\n"}
