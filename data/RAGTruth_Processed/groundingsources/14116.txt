The place was hopping on a Saturday evening with Karaoke for the Goleta locals. I brought my daughter and she was able to sing, too. Brian has a great selection of music and it was fun to be out on the patio enjoying a beer while watching people get up and sing. The patio has heaters and good seating. Karaoke was very popular so we had to leave before our next shot at the mic.  I will come back for more!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-01-28 03:05:38", "review_text": "Most authentic Mexican food I've had in SB! The tortillas were handmade & the salsa was to die for. The food was super delicious, and the venue itself was cozy. Definitely coming back and taking my family when they come to visit me. Definitely recommend!"}]}
