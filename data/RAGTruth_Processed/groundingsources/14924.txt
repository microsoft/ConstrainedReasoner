I ordered a 10 piece spicy nuggets and watched the guy literally touch every persons order with no gloves on. Bare hands on every food. My boyfriend asked the cashier multiple times if she can tell him to put on gloves in which she said she would tell him and never did. After asking again she claimed she told him when I was looking at her the whole time and she never once walked back there. There is no excuse for unsanitary conditions. The FDA needs to get involved with this McDonalds. Especially during a time of Covid. I am highly upset and would love to talk to a manager about these unacceptable conditions."}]}
