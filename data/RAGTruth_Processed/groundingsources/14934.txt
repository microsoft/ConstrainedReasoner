The staff was judgmental, cold, and passive aggressive.\n\nWe decided to pop in for some beignets and counter the sweetness, waters were ordered. This seemed to to be what unlocked the floodgates within our waitress as she gave us a judgmental glance as she walked away. Upon returning back with our waters, we weren't quite ready on what type of beignets we wanted to order, so we asked for a little more time. This must have added fuel to her fire because she purposely didn't bother returning to our table even when we made it obvious we were ready. We even locked eyes with her several times and this still didn't register.\nMy mother had to get up, walk towards the bar where the woman was sitting and chatting away with another waitress, just to put in our orders. Fortunately my mom doesn't take crap or sass from anyone so she did let her have it, in a respectable tone as there were other diners eating.\nThe beignets were, surprisingly, really good but we just vowed to never come back due to the shifty service and I'm not shocked that this place is now closed. It's 2015, no one has time for that type of behavior."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-07-03 15:23:07", "review_text": "Always a great meal at any of the Cajun Kitchen locations.
