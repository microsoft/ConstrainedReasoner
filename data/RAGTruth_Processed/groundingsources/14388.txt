{"question": "what are properties of gold", "passages": "passage 1:Like other transition metals gold's valence electrons, or the electrons it uses to combine with other elements, are present in more than one shell. Unusually for a metal, gold can also form compounds (aurides) in which its oxidation number is negative (-1).\n\npassage 2:Gold is a heavy metal (density 19.3 g cm -3) and one gram of gold can be hammered out into a thin sheet of gold a metre in area, and just 230 atoms or so thick. Gold leaf is translucent and the transmitted light is greenish blue (gold metal reflects yellow and red, leaving the greenish blue colour.\n\npassage 3:Gold is metallic, with a yellow colour when in a mass, but when finely divided it may be black, ruby, or purple. It is the most malleable and ductile metal; 1 ounce (28 g) of gold can be beaten out to 300 square feet. It is a soft metal and is usually alloyed to give it more strength.\n\n"}
