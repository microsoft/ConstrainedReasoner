It was recently beautifully refurbished into an oasis of an artisan strip mall and offers surprises both inside and out. \n\nThe venue is wonderfully landscaped and offers great curb appeal, with ambient lighting and drought tolerant vegetation. The parking area is small but there are reserved spaces in a lot across the street where Low Pigeon Coffee is located. \n\nThe exterior retains its original \"mill\" charm with natural wood siding and large industrial windows. You'd have no idea it housed several businesses from the front and that is what I appreciate. The facade was kept to look like how it always has, so it remains in tune with the neighborhood rather than sticking out like a sore thumb. \n\nYou'll find the coolest courtyard just beyond the entrance which is shared by all businesses. It is well lit and offers ample seating and a few clean restrooms. I've been when there is live music and it's the ideal place to enjoy a beverage under the evening sky. \n\nThere are a handful of small businesses occupying The Mill. I love the vibe of Potek Wine, the interior is intimate and the exposed barrels make for a nice backdrop. I'd say the star of the show is the Third Window Brewing which offers a large main room along with a secondary private patio and a rotating restaurant which varies from their in-house menu to nightly popup dining. A great vibe overall."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2018-04-09 02:51:12", "review_text": "I'm not a fan of racism. These owners were super rude to another table at the establishment. We saw a table asked to leave after spending over a $100 on drinks. Unpleasant and unreasonable, there are better places to enjoy craft drinks in Santa B\u00e1rbara."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-06-09 23:36:06", "review_text": "I absolutely love this spot! I like taking friends here when they come to town. The vibe is super chill. I highly recommend trying their beer flight. The servings are extremely generous and super tasty. I'm not even a beer drinker."}]}
