There is a sign that warns you might find bugs in the lettuce. Beware!\n\nThere are typical salad toppings, some pasta salads, etc. Some examples: egg, turkey, tuna, olives, tofu, cheeses, and so on. \n\nIt's $0.50/oz, so don't get more than you can eat!\n\nTheir soups are ok. I like the Cauliflower Soup. The chicken \"Pozole\" is more like chile verde (not very good). Their breadsticks are ok. Their cake-loaf slices are tasty. I have yet to try their cookies.\n\nOverall, because you can customize your meal, it's a good choice when you're hungry."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2014-06-19 19:54:35", "review_text": "The butternut squash soup blew my mind and I was very tempted my their spanakopitas.
