The best deal is their bento lunch combinations."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2009-02-11 08:17:05", "review_text": "Had a craving for salmon, and was thrilled to find this place. Came in and ordered 2 orders of salmon sushi. The waiter gave me one of those faces where you're pretty sure he didn't understand, but it'd be kind of awkward to ask if he didn't understand. So he returned a while later with spicy salmon rolls. When I explained that wasn't really what I had ordered, he returned to the kitchen, then came back a minute later to explain they'd used up all the salmon on the spicy rolls. \n\nFuck those guys. Two stars!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2008-10-06 19:49:44", "review_text": "OK - let me preface this review by saying this: the term \"all-you-can-eat\" and sushi should NEVER EVER be in the same sentence.  The point of sushi is that it's fresh, prepared to order and any place that has \"all-you-can-eat\" amounts of it, is certainly not giving you anything quality.  Now I can't comment on this sushi in particular because I didn't have any (nor would I ever, anywhere) - but the Thai we had here was fine.  I had the Japanese curry which was way too soupy (not like mom's) and tasted the coconut.  Bot were so-so.  We were headed over to the Arlington Theatre to see David Byrne so were in sort of a rush but this place didn't do much to impress.  From the slow service to the waitstaff basically tripping over themselves, it was just an average experience at-best.  Cheap but not so good."}]}
