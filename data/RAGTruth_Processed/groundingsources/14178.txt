This year will surely see me at Anna's quite a few more times. When a friend told me that a bakery close to where I live offers vegan donuts, I was psyched--I'm vegan and it's oddly difficult to find good vegan food, sweets, and drinks in this area. Checking out Anna's Bakery a few days later, I wasn't let down. \n\nI've sampled both the vegan glazed donut and the apple fritter, as well as the house coffee, and all were great. The donut is puffy and airy and sweet. The fritter has glorious crunchy, oily edges and a surprisingly doughy interior, complete with apple pieces and a glossy, sugary varnish. (Did you know some 'apple fritters' elsewhere don't even contain apple?) The coffee is hot and black and perfectly balances the candy-like sweetness of the baked goods. \n\nThere's always a long line and seating is limited so be prepared. This shop also offers non-vegan donuts (the majority contain milk products, though I'm crossing my fingers for a vegan cake donut in 2022). There is also a menu of savory food. Breads and donuts and cookies are also available to go. That pink box, unmistakably brimming with tasty treats, is sure to being smiles to any gathering... especially if you have vegan friends who are so used to being left out when sweet baked goods appear."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-27 05:28:12", "review_text": "SO friendly and donuts are always amazing. All staff, from the cashier to the owner. All lovely people. They always greet with by my name. I love to see how they interact with all customers. I am always happy to give them business as it is very well deserved. Keep up the wonderful work! Anna's has been around for a long time and has always been one of my favorites."}]}
