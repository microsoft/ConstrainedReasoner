My friends and I were visiting UCSB from out of town for the weekend and we were looking for a breakfast place before the long trip back home. This place has a cozy atmosphere and I was surprised that there was a live band playing. I ordered the crab omelette and my sister ordered the Loco Moco that they had as one of the day's specials. Both dishes were tasty and hearty, plus reasonably priced. I love how filled the omelette was and how the cheese from inside the omelette would stretch from every forkful! Even the food that my friends ordered looked delicious. The service was also pretty good. Definitely would come again when we come back to visit UCSB."}]}
