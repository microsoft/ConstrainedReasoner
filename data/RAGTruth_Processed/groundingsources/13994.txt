She is English and we were relieved that she enjoyed the food.  The food was hearty and we were very full.  It's a very spacious and clean pub.  They also had outdoor dining.  We had very good service."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-22 18:43:40", "review_text": "Finally, an Irish pub that can actually pour a proper pint of Guinness in southern California.  It is nice to see they actually have a legit nitro system, comparable to the ones from Ireland.  \n\nThis is a good place to grab a bite away from the hustle and bustle of state street.  There were plenty of available tables and no wait for dinner. \nThis fish and chips were solid along with the steak pie.  Also had chicken tenders off the kids menu and my daughter had no complaints. \n\n4 stars."}]}
