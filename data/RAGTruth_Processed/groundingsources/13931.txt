US deports 100+ Migrants to Venezuela
The Biden administration conducted its first deportation flight to Venezuela in years, sending over 100 Venezuelans back to their home country. The Department of Homeland Security made the decision to resume direct repatriations in an effort to discourage illegal border crossings, following an agreement with Venezuelan authorities to accept the return of their nationals. Corey Price, an acting executive associate director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, stated that there would be several more flights in the coming days and weeks.
The migrants on the flight had illegally entered the US between ports of entry and were prioritized based on recent arrivals and criminal history. Since President Biden took office, nearly half a million Venezuelans have illegally crossed the southwest border, with a peak of over 34,000 arrests in April. To address this, Biden extended temporary protected status to around 472,000 Venezuelan migrants, allowing them to live and work legally in the US. However, those who have not applied for TPS and have deportation orders could still face removal. Immigration attorneys are advising eligible Venezuelans to apply for TPS promptly to avoid deportation.
