{"question": "how to bbq corn on the cob?", "passages": "passage 1:Ingredients. 1  4 ears corn-on-the-cob, husked. 2  1/4 cup butter, softened or olive oil. 3  2 tablespoons KRAFT\u00ae Grated Parmesan Cheese.  1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves, 1  crushed. 1/2 teaspoon salt.  1/8 teaspoon 1  pepper. 2 ice  cubes.\n\npassage 2:If you want a bit of char on your corn, peel off a few of the outer layers of the corn husks first, before grilling. Place the corn in their husks on the hot grill. Cover the grill. Turn the corn occasionally, until the husks are completely blackened and charred on all sides, about 15 to 20 minutes. 3 Remove the corn from the grill. Let them sit for 5 minutes or until cool enough to handle.\n\npassage 3:2Soak in water 1 hour or more. With the husks still on, soak the corn in ice water. 2 to 3 hours is best, but an hour will do. Fully submerge the corn in the water. 1Grill 'em. Grill the corn over medium heat with the lid closed. Cook each side until the husk is a crispy brown to slightly black. The insides are protected by the layers of husk and the ice water they soaked in, so don't worry if they over cook too much. Rotate a quarter turn after about 5 minutes, when the husks are brown.\n\n"}
