They're also open late which is always great when you're in a college town. I love that they have a menu that offers every style of meat veganized (including soy pastor!) \n\nI'd love to try the vegan fries with meat (asada fries) and the breakfast burritos on my next visit. The portions are huge so I would recommend splitting or saving for 2 meals."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-02 17:48:00", "review_text": "Literally experienced the worst costumer service.

Super disappointing when we pick up food then get home and realize they gave us the completely wrong thing, especially when it's covered in cheese and my boyfriend can't eat dairy!!!! Not the best customer service either"}]}
