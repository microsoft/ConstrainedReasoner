When you walk in this establishment, the employees are very nice and accommodating.  Seems like a nice, quiet environment to sit and work in.  I like the variety of items on the menu as far as coffees/drinks go.  The caramel latte was very good, the drinks are all very unique and are presented very well.  I have never had the food items so I can not say if I would recommend them but according to others reviews, I will have to try the avocado toast on my next visit--as well as one of the specialty drinks."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-06 18:25:41", "review_text": "Discovered this little coffee shop while visiting Santa Barbara. So cute inside and they have outside seating. Cappuccinos and bagels were great!"}]}
