It was good and hit the spot.  Gentleman working was very nice.  Food cam out quickly.  Had the P3 Pho Tai, Chin and A1 Goi Cuon Tom Thit Heo.  Both good and flavorful.   Pho was hot temperature.  Took it to go.  Total with tax and tip about $24.  I would recommend"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-06 20:13:04", "review_text": "The best pho, bun, and banh mi you can get in SB! Delicious pho broth (all of the varieties are good from the classic beef pho to chicken to veggie) and great service."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-08 02:50:21", "review_text": "Winter time is perfect to have a warm and comforting bowl of pho! My favorite meat combination is simply fatty brisket, tendon, and tripe, which provides rich flavors and a great contrast in textures. Crunchy bean sprout, some chili, and a squeeze of lime bring out the flavorful bone broth too! And if you're running hot, cool down with a classic thai tea! Their thai tea was on the bland side, I think due to too much milk compared to the actual tea. Definitely the pho place to go in town."}]}
