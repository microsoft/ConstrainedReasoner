{"question": "how to change appearance ins sims 4", "passages": "passage 1:Change Appearance also allows the player to do anything that can be done in the Makeup, Facial Hair & Glasses area of CAS. Unlike the CAS controls, Change Appearance allows the player to change the color of a Sim's eyebrows, stubble, and facial hair independently of the Sim's hair color.\n\npassage 2:The Change Appearance dialog can also be accessed through vanities and the Ug-No-More Makeover Station. In The Sims 3, this interaction opens a limited Create A Sim room, which allows the player to edit the Sim's hair and makeup.\n\npassage 3:For this, you can use any mirror in the game (Maxis or custom). With the sim you want to change selected, click on the mirror and choose Change Appearance. Your sim will walk to the mirror, and you'll get a window that will allow you to change their makeup, accessories, facial hair, and eyebrows.\n\n"}
