Once inside, one's temperature is taken to ensure the safety of customers and staff. \n\nWhen dining late mid day, we were immediately seated in a nicely appointed, well-lit environment near a lovely cascading wall fountain. Our \"human\" server was very friendly & congenial. The menu is available by scanning a QR code on the table, or a paper copy is available. The printed menu is written in English and Chinese. \n\nUpon being seated, an individual bottle of water was placed on our table for each of us. After giving us adequate time to study the menu, our order was taken promptly.\n\nIn short order, our meal began to arrive from the kitchen via a talking robot server. Upon arriving at our table, the robot asked us to remove our dishes and tap her hand, so she could \"get back to work\". How cool is that?! The robot is a nice & fun addition to this family run establishment. \n\nWe were quite pleased with the dishes we ordered. The selections of each dish were beautifully presented, and were generous in portion size. Everything was delicious.\n\nMeet Up Chinese Cuisine is good for groups, and offers live music on Fridays & Saturdays evenings according to the male greeter. \n\nCome and enjoy!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-25 04:34:59", "review_text": "They accepted our order and cancelled it 2 hours later.

You'll see a robot waitress meandering around with a tray of food, but also a small stage with some old school videos projected on the wall. The vibe in general is quite funky and eclectic which I didn't expect. \n\nThere are a good number of Sichuan dishes - we tried the toothpick lamb (my favorite of the night), twice cooked pork (decent/a little salty, and I'm probably a tough judge because I grew up eating this), mapo tofu (glad to report that they don't hold back with the mala), and dan dan noodles (a generous serving!). It was so nice to find a restaurant that offers authentic Chinese food in Santa Barbara of all places. \n\nWe also tried the desserts (sesame balls and fried rice cake) which were alright, although I would not recommend (unless you're with non-Asian friends who otherwise wouldn't be able to try) because they're really overpriced for what they are."}]}
