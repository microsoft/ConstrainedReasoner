I finally went up to the front and asked what the hold up was and only then did they mention the bus was having problems and they were sending us a new one, 30\nMinutes after being trapped in a hot sweaty bus. I had to pull the lever to open the doors to let people out myself because people were so hot to the point of panicking. Giving one star because they did send another bus to get us but I'm just pissed me and all my friends were trapped in a sauna for 30 minutes with no update on why we were stuck for so long."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-01-19 23:04:16", "review_text": "Simply put, Bill's Bus was a fantastic choice for our wedding transportation.

Craig was respectful, honest, and on top of everything from the moment we called him for our wedding. \nCraig and his team safely shuttled our closest family and friends from the hotel to our wedding venue in Goleta. The buses were great - clean and most importantly, on time! Not to mention he might be the last vendor in the Santa Barbara area not gouging his customers. He offers a reliable service with great staff and at an affordable price. I highly recommend them!"}]}
