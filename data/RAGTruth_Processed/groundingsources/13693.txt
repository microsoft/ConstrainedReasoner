Fairly priced in contrast with other similar restaurants. People who work there are friendly and accommodating. I especially appreciate Juan who always prepares my Burrito in the way that I like it. He smiles when I arrive and remembers how I like my Chicken Burrito prepared!  He's the best burrito chef and a nice guy at that! Thank you Juan!"}]}
