{"question": "how to clean tarnished jewelry at home", "passages": "passage 1:1. Shine silver. Tarnish is the enemy, and here are your weapons: For items that are merely dull, filmy or starting to discolor, mix a few drops of mild dish soap with warm water and dip in a soft cloth. Rub the jewelry, then rinse in cool water and buff with a cloth until dry. For heavier tarnish, mix a paste of three parts baking soda to one part water. Wet the silver and apply the cleaner with a soft, lint-free cloth (not paper towels, which can scratch).\n\npassage 2:The best way to clean a diamond is with warm soapy water and a soft-bristle brush or old toothbrush, says Loretta Castoro, vice president and international jewelry buyer for Jewelry Television. Pat it dry with a soft cloth.\n\npassage 3:Pour two cups of hot water into a bowl. You just need enough to cover the jewelry you're cleaning. This method works as a gentle cleanser that removes tarnish without abrading the silver. If your silver is lightly tarnished, the salt bath should take the tarnish right off. If you're cleaning a lot of jewelry at once, you can use more water. For just one piece of jewelry, use less water. If your jewelry has gemstones, make sure they won't be affected by being submerged in a saltwater solution.\n\n"}
