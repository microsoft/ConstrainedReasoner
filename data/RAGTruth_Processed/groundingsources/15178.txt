{"question": "how to boil a lobster at home", "passages": "passage 1:Procedures for how to boil lobsters. 1. Fill the pot about one half to two thirds full of water, so that after you put in the lobsters, they'll be completely covered. If you use sea water, you don't need to add more salt. But if you used regular water, add about 1/4 cup. Some people like to add a few lemon slices, or a cup or two of wine or beer, or even herbs such as thyme or bay leaves to the cooking water to add flavor to the lobster meat.\n\npassage 2:Preheat the broiler. Place lobster tails on a baking sheet. With a sharp knife or kitchen shears, carefully cut top side of lobster shells lengthwise. Pull apart shells slightly, and season meat with equal amounts butter, paprika, salt, and white pepper. Broil lobster tails until lightly browned and lobster meat is opaque, about 5 to 10 minutes.\n\npassage 3:Pour about 1 inch of water in the bottom of a large pot and bring to a boil. Add the salt and place a steamer insert inside the pot so that it is just above the water level. Put the lobster tails on the rack and cover the pot. Cover and steam for 8 minutes. And don't peek! Serve with melted butter.\n\n"}
