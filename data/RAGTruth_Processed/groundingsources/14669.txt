It's pasta (you can choose cream sauce or marinara sauce), gross--i mean, garlic cheese bread, and a salad for 3.95 and you get the free bread, too. That's a good deal and it's a filling meal, too bad the bread tastes like cardboard, the pasta is mushy and overcooked and the caesar salad is bland and is way too mayonnaisey. Actually, the entire meal is bland, minus the bread which tastes like a kick in the face--that's not a good thing. I thought that cheese + garlic + butter always meant a good time, apparently not.\n\nEven when this place used to be Pascuccis it was pretty effing disgusting. The free bread is pretty gross too since it's either soggy or way too hard. \n\nAlso, the service I had the four times I came was absolutely terrible. One of our meals didn't even come out until everyone had finished eating because they forgot to put the order in (this was when it used to be Zaffiro). On the three occasions I've been to the Monday Happy Hour (definitely three times too many), we've had to wait at least an hour and a half before we got our food, even though the place was completely empty.  \n\nFreaking waste of time and money. I spit at you, Zaffiro."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2007-11-16 19:05:14", "review_text": "please see my previous review for when this place was called- Pascucci's\n\ni stand by that review, single word\n\npoop"}]}
