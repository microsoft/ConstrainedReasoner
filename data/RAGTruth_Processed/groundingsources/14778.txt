As a matter of fact, this experience was so disappointing it caused me to take time out of my very busy life to write my first review ever. \n\nI'm someone who is happy when there is quantity. So I spend $60 here thinking that should do a good job filling me up (I order the 25$ sashimi bowl and 2 rolls) and I did not get filled up. The sashimi itself disappointed me as well due to the low quantity of cuts compared to kyoto's 25$ bowl. In addition, the fish itself I thought was less fresh. The 2 rolls were also small in comparison to Kyoto's. I'm never coming here again. Man I could have gotten 10 chipotle burrito's with those $60...."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-04-23 19:18:42", "review_text": "This is the best sushi in Santa Barbara, aside from maybe Arigato, which is absolutely not worth the money.

The ambiance is *totally* different. It's become a big business. They're still getting the hang of how to serve so many people, and seem always to be apologizing for slow service, when it's actually about the same as other places. \n\nThe food was not great the first few times I went, but the last time...yum...they were back on their game. It's worth a try!"}]}
