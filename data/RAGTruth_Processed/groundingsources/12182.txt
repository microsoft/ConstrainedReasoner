{"question": "what do i do if i got my sperrys wet", "passages": "passage 1:1 Using a leather conditioner is especially important if you wash your Sperry shoes with detergent. 2  Detergent has a tendency to dry the leather out, and conditioner will help to revitalize the leather, infusing moisture back into it. 3  Reassemble the shoes when done.\n\npassage 2:Best Answer: Sure you can get your topsiders wet-its no big deal. If you've got the regular, dark brown ones I wouldn't think twice about it. If you've got the light tan ones, water might stain them, but I doubt it.\n\npassage 3:Pick up a suede bar & leather brush (a cleaning toothbrush will also work). They are between $5-$10. I always get annoyed when shoe stores try to sell me the associated accoutrements with my shoes but in this case I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it. You can\u2019t handle a stain on these shoes otherwise and they really do work.\n\n"}
