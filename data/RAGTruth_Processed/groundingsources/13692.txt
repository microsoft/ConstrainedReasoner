I live around the corner as always try to give this family shop The benefit of the doubt. But the truth is this food fucking sucks. Sorry excuse for anyone trying to reach Mexican food and don't need their call themselves authentic. Horrible anyone who truly enjoys his spot a has never been south of the border and B must have the tongue amputated because I can't take the damn thing every time I've eaten here"}]}
