The customer service is worst than a McDonald's. They are rude, they take their time making sandwiches. The simplest order they mess up. I've dealt with everyone that works at this location and I have never had a good experience. So disappointed"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-04-07 20:16:32", "review_text": "This is by far the worst subway I have ever been to, and unfortunately it has to be the only one in my town. I just spent a bunch of time ordering on the app and placing the order, only to be told that I could not pick up my sandwiches. I had proof of payment, a receipt that matched the store, along with exact descriptions of my items. Rather than working with me and offering to make the sandwiches, I was told to call 1-800 subway, to voice a complaint, which is not even a real phone number. I was then told to call the phone number on the door, which is just a phone number for the actual store that I was already standing in. Once there was no one else in the store, Only then did Irene offered to call the owner of this franchise, I waited for 15 minutes while she was on the phone with the owner looking at an iPad at which point I decided to leave with no food, having paid the restaurant for literally nothing. Now I get to go battle with subway corporate, who doesn't even have a non-automated phone system anymore."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-05-25 21:30:37", "review_text": "Terrible online and pickup service. 30 min after receiving order confirmation they haven't even started yet. Subway said they have not received any online order."}]}
