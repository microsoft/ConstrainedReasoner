Illinois Senate President Backed by Nursing Home Industry Amid Tax Break Controversy
Campaign contributions raise questions about influence on tax legislation
Illinois Senate President Don Harmon finds himself at the center of a controversy as he supports legislation that could provide substantial property tax breaks to nursing homes in Cook County. The issue arises as it's revealed that he has accepted nearly $2 million in campaign contributions from the industry trade group representing nursing homes, with over $700,000 received in the past year.
The political action committee for the Health Care Council of Illinois has been one of Harmon's significant campaign contributors, advocating for the tax relief measure that would benefit nursing homes. Recent contributions from the group include $10,000 on October 19, $100,000 on September 30, and $5,000 on August 23. This support coincided with the General Assembly's passage of legislation backed by Harmon, which aimed to change the property tax assessment of private, for-profit nursing homes in Cook County.
The legislation would reclassify these nursing homes as residential property, lowering their property taxes by millions. In contrast, they are currently classified as commercial property in Chicago and inner-ring suburbs, subjecting them to higher real estate taxes.
Harmon has not provided a statement regarding the contributions or his stance on the legislation. However, his spokesman, John Patterson, emphasized that legislative decisions are made in the best interests of the public and to ensure fairness for all organizations.
Ron Nunziato, the senior director of policy and regulatory affairs at the Health Care Council, defended Harmon, noting his long-standing support for nursing homes. He claimed there was no direct link between the campaign contributions and Harmon's position on the legislation.
The controversy emerged in May when State Sen. Celina Villanueva filed an amendment that included the tax reclassification for Cook County nursing homes. While Patterson stated that Harmon's legislative staff was involved in drafting the provision, Villanueva didn't return calls.
Despite the controversy, the legislation passed the General Assembly and was sent to Governor J.B. Pritzker, who used an amendatory veto to remove the nursing home provision. Pritzker argued that the tax break would shift the financial burden onto suburban Cook County homeowners and small businesses, potentially causing financial hardships and foreclosure.
The Health Care Council and nursing homes in Cook County are now seeking legislative support for an override of the governor's veto. While it's unclear whether Harmon supports this move, a source familiar with the process indicated strong support from his Senate chief of staff, Jacob Butcher.
