After an hour+ they told me it was being delivered. And after 2 hours I called back and they said it was never a delivery order. Guy would NOT even apologize for screwing up when we first called. The he threw the pizza across the counter at me and was a completely rude, pretentious, arrogant ass. And he called me crazy for even being upset. Told me to just get out with my 2 hour old cold and slimy pizza. \n\nI blame myself for ordering from there anyhow it's tasteless, cheap, cardboard tasting poor quality ingredient pizza. And yet I still (unfortunately) ordered from there. (I'm from Nyc. We know pizza). \n\nDon't bother with this place. And don't give your business to rude, mean, super sexist jerks who are too cocky to say \"sorry, we screwed up.\"  Your money is better spent on other places that value your business in this community town. \n\nI'd give this place 0 stars if I could."}]}
