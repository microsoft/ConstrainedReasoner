Didn't think much of it at first but our bartender Alice made our experience impeccable. Not only is she a great mixologist, she is down to earth and stole our hearts with her charm.

Best bartender ever!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-09 00:03:34", "review_text": "My husband Matt B. and I visited the Sportsman a couple weeks ago for a round of beers after dinner on State Street. We'd been to the Riviera the night before, which took over the Sportsman's old location, and were curious about this place, as it was apparently a Santa Barbara spot that had been around for ages. We stopped by around 10:30 on a Sunday night and it was pretty calm, with an unassuming dive bar atmosphere. There weren't a lot of people and we talked to the bartender for a while, a woman who's been with the bar for quite a long time.\n\nWe got a couple of draft beers--two IPAs on tap, I think Figueroa Mountain and Firestone--and played a couple rounds of pool. It's a good thing there weren't a lot of people around because we (and me especially) are absolutely dog shit terrible at pool. I was embarrassed that my own husband was there to witness my astounding lack of coordination. Like if someone wanted to blackmail me with the footage, I would probably be willing to pay. We should never do that in public.\n\nEven so, it was fun, and the beer was good and refreshing. We enjoyed our visit to the Sportsman and would be happy to go back for more beer and maybe pool, as long as no one else is watching."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-27 18:51:52", "review_text": "We love dive bars, especially when the bartender makes bloody Mary's from scratch! No premix crap! It was a Monday morning and the bloody mary really hit the spot. Very small place but clean. Locals spot, friendly people"}]}
