I'm not sure what I served was ever a living creature at any point in time. My friend took one bite out of it and spit it out. By far the worst dining experience I've ever had. The patty was pink, falling apart and soggy. The most unfortunate part was that the bun was honestly not that bad, but the patty soaked through it after about 30 seconds. Please make sure the food they serve you is edible before you take a bite #regrets #throwingupinthebathroom\n\nMuch love JSB cafe a"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-03-15 03:32:25", "review_text": "These gals and lads work hard. Their food is great and they practice a lot and it shows. My only real negative feedback is that the food can SOMETIMES be a hit or miss. But hey, you're at a college and it's a place of learning. The fries really need to go however. Same fries given in the regular cafeteria, those are really not so good. But that's not their fault, that falls on faculty/staff."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-11-14 19:05:55", "review_text": "Very good, prices are mid range but not unreasonable.  All of the food is made fresh, daily I'm pretty sure.  The selection is huge, I'm surprised to see this high quality of food on a college campus.  There are lots of things to choose from and they all look great."}]}
