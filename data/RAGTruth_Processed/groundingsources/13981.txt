Volleyball loses nail-biter to D-Y 3-2
( Oct. 17, 2023 ) The volleyball team battled back from losing the first two sets Monday against Dennis-Yarmouth to force a tiebreaker but fell apart in the fifth set and dropped it 15-1 to take a 3-2 loss.
“All in all the match in and of itself, phenomenal. I couldn't be happier,” coach Andrew Viselli said. “They fought, they played against a really good team and their coach thinks they're going to win a state championship.”
The match started on a high note for Nantucket as captain Vicky Todorova earned the 1,000th kill of her varsity career early in the opening set. The Whalers took 6-1 leads to begin the first two sets but couldn’t hold on to the momentum in either set and dropped them 25-20 and 26-24.
Alice O’Banion stepped up with several key blocks in the middle and Bianca Santos had a string of strong serves to help Nantucket get back in the match and win sets three and four 25-21 and 26-24 before the wheels came off for the Whalers in the final set.
“15-1, that’s just a drubbing,” Viselli said. “That’s indicative of the mindset of teams. (D-Y coach Dru Sisson) has played three or four five-setters already where they’ve lost the first two sets and come back and won the remaining three. It just speaks to where both teams are. They’re tested against big time teams over and over and over again because she puts them in that situation.”
The Whalers are now 9-5 on the season and will be back at home Thursday to host Sturgis East for the first of two matches with the Navigators this season.
