The hotel opened its doors in 1936 & primarily catered to fisherman, railroad workers, locals & travelers. Seventy-five years later new life was brought to the building and Bay Roadhouse Bar & Grill has made a commitment to serving delicious, high quality food at fair prices to hungry locals and travelers alike ever since.  \n \nCentrally located right on State St. in the popular area known as The Funk Zone, and just a couple blocks from the beach, we are easily reached from anywhere in town.  Surrounded by local wineries and just across from the historic Santa Barbara train station we are perfectly placed for those in town just for the day, or for those who have been here for years.  Enjoy a varied selection of food and drink served with a great attitude.  And with indoor and outdoor seating,  fireplaces, TV's, a kid's menu, free corkage, and PARKING!!-there is something for everyone.\n\nSTATS:\nOpen 11 a.m. - 10 p.m.\nIndoor & outdoor seating\nLive music\nThe About page of the website needs some work\n\nEXPERIENCE:\nAfter saying farewell to The Crew at the train station across the street, a friend and local invited me to hang out for a while. We started out here at Bay Roadhouse where we met up with a couple mutual friends. Sitting outside enjoying the perfect warm with a slightly cool ocean breeze we enjoyed some brew and live music.\n\nThey don't have a wide selection of adult beverages, but they are reasonably priced and we all found something that satisfied our palate. Our server was tentative  and kept our water and other glasses full. \n\nThis is a perfect spot for track travelers to stop after a train ride from where ever it is they came from, as well as waiting for their ride out of town Not to mention, it's beach and pier adjacent. Also, it marks the start or end of the infamous State Street."}]}
