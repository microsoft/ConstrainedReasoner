This is more like a bar than a restaurant. Food was not what I thought it will be, but was good, tasty, did I say finger licking tasty?... Drinks were good, but more like a splash over ice than a full on drink. As my company was explaining, this is how it goes nowadays, I guess?... as far as service, there is no host to greet you, nor inform you no one will take your order at the table. Nor to tell you have to go in the back to order your food nor to tell you have to order the drinks at the bar. Once you get past that, service is good and friendly. enjoy your food! ( this was not a complaint just mere info for the ones like me, just passing through and not knowing the \"basics\" :) thank you!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-09-08 19:55:44", "review_text": "We ordered takeout and ate in front of the fire pit at our hotel. The chicken Plato mixto had everything I like (rice, beans, yucca, plantains). The chicken tasted fine, the sides were better. The croquettes are tasty, but would benefit from another flavor inside (guava, apricot, chilis) to break up the goat cheese, which can be a little overwhelming."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-24 18:20:41", "review_text": "I am in town for work and was having trouble finding a kitchen that was open past 10pm and my uber driver suggested Cubaneo and we absolutely loved it! Food was great, service was even better and the restaurant is beautifully decorated, you truly feel like you're in a cute restaurant in Havana."}]}
