China's Military Continues Expansion With New Nuclear-Powered Guided Missile Submarines
China has officially launched its first nuclear-powered guided missile submarines according to the Pentagon. In the short term, the Pentagon has indicated that this means that the Chinese navy "...will have the ability to conduct long-range precision strikes against land targets from its submarine and surface combatants using land-attack cruise missiles..." which in turn will enhance China's power projection capabilities wherever China deploys these submarines.
The significance of these new submarines goes back to the Cold War, when the Soviet Union itself engaged in the development of similarly armed submarines to specifically target the aircraft carriers of the United States. Given widespread concerns that China might well be considering an invasion of Taiwan given the preoccupation of the United States with the war ongoing between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the potential for the outbreak of a regional war in the Middle East as the result of the conflict continuing to unfold between Israel and Hamas, the fact that these submarines are coming into service in the Chinese navy now is something the military of the United States is likely observing closely.
Unfortunately, the recent report by the Pentagon regarding developments in the Chinese military offer additional causes of concern beyond the additional of these new submarines to the Chinese navy. Other things mentioned include a projection of nearly 1000 nuclear warheads being operation by 2030, up from a count of 500, as well as the construction of new silo fields that could host more than 300 new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos. There was even commentary on how China might well be exploring the possibility of developing conventionally armed intercontinental-range missile systems that would allow strikes against the United States. With all these developments occuring simultaneously with the continued expansion of the Chinese navy, already the largets in the world by number of ships and submarines at 370, to an estimated 435 by 2030, the simulated attack operations and rhetoric coming from China aginst Taiwan should be taken seriously going forward.
