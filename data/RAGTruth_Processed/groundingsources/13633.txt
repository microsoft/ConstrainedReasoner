We rented the upstairs space for the evening and had 30 guests for the rehearsal dinner and then the rest of the guests (about 75 people) joined after for drinks. The taco buffet was delicious!!! And the space was exactly what we wanted for our group.  Dina, the Events Coordinator, was incredibly helpful throughout our planning process, starting in January and right through the event itself. All of the staff here were amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to host a similar event, or even for dinner - the food was amazing!!"}]}
