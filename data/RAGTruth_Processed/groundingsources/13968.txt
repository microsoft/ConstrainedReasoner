Governor Gavin Newsom, accompanied by First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom, is embarking on a weeklong trip to China, focusing on climate action and fostering partnerships between two of the world's largest economies, his office announced Wednesday.
The trip aims to advance climate initiatives, promote economic development, boost tourism, and encourage cultural exchange, according to the Governor's Office.
