Volleyball battles Barnstable in 3-0 loss
( Oct. 23, 2023 ) The volleyball team lost its second-straight match Monday, but the Whalers battled against Barnstable, one of the top teams in Div. 1, in the 3-0 loss.
“I'm not disheartened,” coach Andrew Viselli said. That is the preeminent program to be able to say that you battled against, so I feel good about that. Obviously I want the win, however, when you put a team like that against the ropes, that's a win in and of itself.”
Nantucket hung right with the Red Hawks in the first two sets. Set one was tied 15-15 and then 20-20, but Barnstable finished with a 5-1 run to take the set 25-21.
Late in set two, the Whalers won five out of six points to pull with 23-21, forcing a Red Hawks timeout. The team would trade the final three points and Barnstable won the set 25-22 before closing out the match with a 25-15 third set.
Despite sharing the same final score, Viselli said Monday’s match was a big step up for Nantucket from its first match against the Red Hawks earlier this season.
“It was night and day,” Viselli said. “We went into their gym and we were afraid, we were tense. You can’t even say that we played when we went to Barnstable. The aura, the mystique, the fans, everything, they just played scared. This time they were like ‘we're here to play’ and they played and they just came up short.”
Now 10-7 on the year, Nantucket will wrap up the regular season this week with matches Wednesday at Sturgis East and Friday at home against St. John Paul II.
