Mark & Melissa were delightful, professional, and very easy to work with.  The selection of pizzas and salads is amazing and truly delicious.  Their staff was so nice and very efficient.  We never waited for food -- the pizzas kept coming!  The truck really sets the tone for the party and enhances the experience.  We added their mini s'mores for dessert at the last minute, which was a great call!  This is how to throw a party!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-12 03:17:39", "review_text": "We attended a wedding rehearsal dinner this evening on the beach with Lucca providing the pizza and salad. It was delicious!  The various pizzas were incredible as was the salad and the awesome mini s'mores for dessert which were also made in the pizza oven.  The Lucca staff was friendly and efficient with keeping hot pizza always available. \n\nIf I lived in Santa Barbara I would definitely use this food truck for parties!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-07-03 04:24:44", "review_text": "I tried Lucca pizza at an event a while back and it was really good pizza and the staff was very friendly.
