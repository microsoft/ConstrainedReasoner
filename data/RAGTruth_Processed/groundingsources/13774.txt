To start of, De La Guerra or \"DLG\" for short, has an expansive variety of food options for those eating there. Walking into DLG you are greeted with a list of all the wonderful, edible food they have prepared for that meal. Let's start with the burgers. Burgers are offered at almost every meal: breakfast lunch and dinner. Although you think that burgers are pretty hard to mess up, they are often undercooked, sometimes even frozen. Now let move on to the Mexican. It gives you diarrhea. In edition to these two favorites of mine, they often offer a wide variety of meat. What kind of meat? Well, you never quite know. But my favorite is the fish cakes:) Have fun at DLG!"}]}
