The water can be saved for use another time when electricity demand is high.\n\npassage 3:Problems and Benefits of Building a Dam. Dams can offer huge benefits in terms of electrical power generation and irrigation. Many massive dams worldwide are a tribute to the achievements of civil engineering and electrical engineering. These great feats of civil engineering are not without problems, however, and there are potential disadvantages as well as benefits to take into account.\n\n"}
