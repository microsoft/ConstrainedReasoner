I've come a handful of times and always had great service and food. In fact as a needed break from visiting my grams in hospice (who has now since passed... rip) my mom and I would come here to regain some mental clarity. Our favorite items are the salads (I wish I could say we've tried more of the menu) but we've had our share of dessert too and have been quite pleased. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for a casual lunch spot."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2013-07-15 14:51:50", "review_text": "What a disappointment!  We were here 2 years ago at the old location and it was fantastic.  The original place was bustling, not here.  What happened?  The sandwich menu changed and not a wide selection of pastries anymore.  I ordered the half chicken pesto sandwich on multi-grain and salad.  The corner of the crust was so hard as if it was old with very thinly sliced chicken.  Very ordinary and this came out to over $10.  My friend ordered her sandwich and asked for sourdough but got white bread instead.  'We will not be coming back!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2013-04-16 22:45:14", "review_text": "ill keep it simple\n\nordered a sandwich\ntook 40 min for it to be made\nwalked back to office, wrong sandwich\nwalked back, and had a second sandwich made\ngot back to office wrong sandwich\n\ntoo expensive for not so good food\nsave your money and go to three pickles"}]}
