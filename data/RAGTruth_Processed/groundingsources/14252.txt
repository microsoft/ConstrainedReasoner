A couple of my favorite things to get here are the chicken pozole and their bagels. With the bagels, you can heat them up yourself with the oven they have next to the soups. It's real easy! Their chives cream cheese is sooo good.

I got a chocolate peanut butter banana shake. Overpriced in my opinion, over $5.00 and came in a very small cup. It's super convenient that it's attached to the parking garage though. If you don't want to walk very far I'd recommend checking it out. They have coffee as well which is nice."}]}
