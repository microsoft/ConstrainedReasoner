They have rainfall that can occur all year long, and often in heavy volume. It is common for them to get at least 100 inches per year. Some areas get up to 400 inches of rain annually.ue to the heat and the moisture of the tropical rainforest biome, the plants and animals that die in this location rot quickly. The decay though offers plenty of rich nutrients for other plants to grow from.\n\npassage 2:Plants Animals Climate Southeast Asian Rainforests The tropical rain forest is a forest of tall trees in a region of year-round warmth.

For example there are herbs and mushrooms that grow on the floor. Various types of fruits and nuts grow on the plants and in the trees.Bananas grow on the vines in this particular biome as well.ue to the heat and the moisture of the tropical rainforest biome, the plants and animals that die in this location rot quickly.
