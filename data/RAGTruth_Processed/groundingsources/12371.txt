Skeletal muscles \u2014 These muscles contract to pull on tendons and move the bones of the skeleton. 2  In addition to producing skeletal movement, muscles also maintain posture and body position, support soft tissues, guard entrances and exits to the digestive and urinary tracts, and maintain body temperature.\n\npassage 2:Three types of muscles. The muscular system can be broken down into three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth and cardiac, according to the NIH. Skeletal muscles are the only voluntary muscle tissue in the human body and control every action that a person consciously performs.hree types of muscles.

Muscular system is composed of special tissue called muscular tissue. Muscles have the ability to contract actvely to provide the force for movements of body parts.uscular system has the following important functions in human body; 1  MOVEMENTS OF BODY PARTS: Skeletal muscles are responsible for all voluntary movements of human body parts.\n\n"}
