The chicken Caesar had freshly grilled real chicken, freshly rinsed crisp romaine, and authentic Parmesan. Coupled with the view, this is far better than most airport dives."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2010-10-27 00:38:56", "review_text": "Could be better, could be worse.  Overlook Cafe has a nice view of the runway and the hills.  It's in the lobby, before security.  My chicken quesadilla was pretty average.  The upside is Blue Moon on tap and a quick kitchen.  Prices could be worse I guess.  But if you can afford to fly through this airport, you either have dough or an expense account.  No dude, no dough.  I have an expense account..."}]}
