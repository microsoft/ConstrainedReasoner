The meat did not taste much different than a burger from the habit but it's twice the price. The flavor combos are interesting in regards to toppings but the execution is subpar. We had the downtown, the mesa and the original. No one was overly impressed. The fries were incredible though! Crispy shoestrings with salt and pepper. \nOverall not bad, but I expected more from a place with  Cat Coras name attached."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-16 04:02:08", "review_text": "Extremely disappointing take-out dinner tonight. Ordered Cobb salads with chicken for us, and a kids burger for our pre-schooler. The salads were over 50% more expensive than our standard local burgers&salad take-out. Chicken for my salad was very undercooked: pink, wet, and tough. Yuck. Kid's burger, which was ordered well-done, was still pink, even near the edges. Both salads had the rockiest bacon \"crumbles\" I've ever eaten; I was seriously worried that I'd damage a tooth, and my wife felt the same. Her conclusion: \"I don't ever need to eat there again.\" I agree."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-10-18 18:20:39", "review_text": "Great service. First time here and the staff helped us out with ordering. Egg on my burger was fantastic, we also had grilled cheese that was good, nothing too special. Fries and onion rings were hot and fresh.  Chocolate malt was a very nice treat.  The baseball game was on but it was not too loud and it was not overly crowder. Most everyone was wearing masks. Great time and we will definitely come back."}]}
