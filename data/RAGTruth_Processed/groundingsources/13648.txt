Because they serve pitchers of beer. That's why. What the fuck else are you going to do when you have some general ed 7 pm Theater class? You're going to hit up Chilitos and get fucked up. That's what.\n\n\nNote: Freebirds is overated garbo by the way for all of you noobs out there. So yourself a favor and get a ranchero burrito from Super Cucas. Your boner/wet vag will thank met later."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2010-11-11 07:27:29", "review_text": "I got a basic chicken burrito.  Somehow, it ended up being $7.07.\n\nThe guys working there were okay - it was the burrito that was so utterly disappointing. After handling the burrito, the tortilla left a powdery coating on my hands.  I couldn't even tell if there was chicken in the burrito after a couple bites, and I couldn't tell if there was salsa in it until I'd worked my way well into it.  And really, those pinto beans?  It made for a filling burrito, but I wanted a good burrito.\n\nI give it credit for not being nasty - it was just bland, and the powdery tortilla made me feel like I'd just handled a bag of cocaine when I'd finished."}]}
