This is so cool. There are restaurants you can visit on the wharf as well. It is a working wharf so be mindful and be courteous of your surroundings. \nIt is similar to most wharfs along the PNW  but it's something to do and see while in a new city. You can't drive on all wharfs so I guess that makes it unique. I didn't see many people fishing when I came, but it is permitted! \nCompared to a weekday, this place is packed on a weekend! I was here on a Friday and was able to get around, but come Saturday, it was jam packed with people everywhere."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-07 17:21:18", "review_text": "Santa Barbara's most visited destination. It's an old pier dating back to 1872 and its the oldest working wharf in California. It's much wider than other wharfs and the only one I've been to you can drive onto. From the street it looks like the entrance is just an area for turning around in but you can grab a ticket at the booth and drive right onto the wharf. First 90 minutes of parking are free.\n\n-If you do drive go slowly, it sounds and feels like riding a wooden rollercoaster in slow-motion and you are driving on old wood and metal bolts.\n\n-Fishing is allowed at the end of the wharf and you'll see crab traps and fishing happening which is fun for the kids.\n\n-There are free public bathrooms.\n\n-Not much to see and do unless you have dinner plans, hilariously we saw staff rounding up wayward outdoor-seating customers that ran off to take pictures. The concern was seagulls would eat their unguarded food.\n\n-There is a psychic/fortune teller on the pier, super nostalgic though they were closed when we went."}]}
