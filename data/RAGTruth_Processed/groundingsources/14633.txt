Good luck getting your refund! \n\nJeff was the best part of that place . I guess I should've listened to the other 1 star helpers when they said it was hard to get into contact with anyone at the spa, but of course I had Lauryns personal number and she always used to get back to me, until shit started to hit the fan with her spa. I did a 5 star review for Lauryn because she asked me to, because she was going through legal shit with the spa and and her ex partner. Lauryn took $225 for a package of 3 massages and didn't refund me when I asked about it. She said she would have her travel table and travel to me and give me my massages but when I text her, she always has an excuse. Hopefully she's using our money for something good."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-08-17 23:14:05", "review_text": "My husband and I got a wonderful couples massage here in late 2014... SADLY we could never redeem our future massage (which we purchased for $99 after the original Groupon deal for a couples massage). For the next two years I tried to book our next PRE-PAID couples massage and got their voicemail (\"mailbox full\") or left a message at one point but never got a call back. I finally reached someone and they were booked TWO MONTHS in advance and couldn't give me a next available date. It was extremely frustrating. I've since moved away and they had the balls to email me this lovely note:\n\n\"Dear Misha,\nIt's your anniversary with Santa Barbara Wine Spa! As our client you are very important to us and we greatly value your business. We truly hope that you have enjoyed your experiences at Santa Barbara Wine Spa and will continue to in the future.\n\nAs always, if you have any suggestions, comments, or requests about future services, then please let us know.\n\nHope to see you soon!\n\nThe Santa Barbara Wine Spa Team\nWeb: http://santabarbarawinespa.com\nPhone: (949) 310-7016\"\n\nJust wow."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-06-09 03:18:33", "review_text": "Groupon Scammers! Beware! The worst customer service experience I've ever had in SB. It took two months to schedule a couple's massage and once they FINALLY got me in, they called the day of - an hour before- to cancel. They are rude and totally shady. It's been a couple of weeks now and I still haven't heard from them to reschedule. I called Groupon and they were able to give me a refund. I left so many voicemails and most of the time couldn't because their mailbox was full. It's been so frustrating and a waste of time and money. Not sure how they are still in business. I'm a SB local and have spread the word about them. Super disappointing!!!"}]}
