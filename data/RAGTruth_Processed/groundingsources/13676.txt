The older lady that was in charge was so nice and she was very patient with me as I slowly browsed through all their menu and each and every single type of sausage they had. My boyfriend opted for the bratwurst combo meal and I always got their sandwich. I forgot what kind of sandwich I got but I remember it being super good. They served their homemade potato salad and sauerkraut. I'm not a big fan of their sauerkraut but my boyfriend loved it! We both equally enjoyed their potato salad because it tasted like authentic european potato salad with big potato chunks!\n\nI really wish European deli would open up again. :( I was so broken hearted when I found out they closed.. still reminiscing even though I'm 100 miles away! Hope the family that ran the restaurant is doing well!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2012-01-18 06:06:55", "review_text": "I don't think I have ever been more disappointed to hear of a restaurant closing. It deserves a final review as having the very best German potato salad and roast beef I have ever had. I am still trying to find someplace in LA/OC even close. Let me know if anyone has a favorite place."}]}
