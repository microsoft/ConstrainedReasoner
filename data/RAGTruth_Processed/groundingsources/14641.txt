I am from out of state and wanted to send some cupcakes to a prospective employer. I reached out to Alison to see if she could do a \"S'more\" flavor cupcake even though it wasn't on her list. She said no problem and came up with a custom recipe for me. She also delivered for free. The cupcakes were little works of *ART*!! She was so detailed, she even used a lighter to \"roast\" the little mini-mallows!! They were adorable!! And they must have been delicious because I GOT THE JOB INTERVIEW! Thank you Alison for going the extra mile to make this a perfect experience from beginning to end."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-04-09 20:51:45", "review_text": "I'm not even a sweet tooth, so this review is BEYOND AMAZING!!!! I have used Alison a number of times to provide sweets for special events, but even more so as gifts! There is no better way to tell someone you love them, or are thankful, than with sugary goodness. Alison not only wanted to explore different flavors for my orders but also was so willing to complete my gluten free orders as well. I even froze some of the mini ones to save for myself, and came back days and days later and still enjoyed them! \nShe has also provided beautiful cupcakes for events, like a wedding, that I have photographed....it's all in the details and she does not disappoint!!\n\nI could not recommend Sugar Cat Studio enough, and look forward to her upcoming release of her cookbook, Sweet, Savory & Sometime Boozy Cupcakes!!!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-03-29 16:06:54", "review_text": "I adore Sugar Cat Studio. Alison is an incredible baker! I fell in love with her cupcakes a few years ago when I tried them for the first time at Corks N' Crowns. She also baked an assortment of bourbon infused cupcakes (one with candied bacon) for my big birthday bash in 2013. They were a hit and everyone loved them! \n\nAlison is very creative. She can take your cupcake ideas and concepts and turn them into a delicious treat that you won't be able to stop eating; until of course they're gone and you have to order more!\n\nI highly recommend SCS! With Alison, you really can't go wrong."}]}
