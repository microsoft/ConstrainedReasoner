We had sweetbread - very nicely done - and bass, perfectly cooked. Also a nice cheese and wine selection. The restaurant was quite empty and they will change it to a more affordable, South American style place. In any case, the team will stay the same and they are very knowledgable and enthusiastic, so check out what they are up to"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-03-26 05:29:17", "review_text": "Nice restaurant that was on the emptier side for a Friday night but looked pretty good, so we tried it out. Service is very attentive and friendly, and our waiter was really knowledgeable about everything on the menu! \n\n-- Appetizers -- \n+ The bread: As my friends know, I love bread - specifically French bread - so anywhere that serves good French bread, I pretty much love.. which also saddens me because I've been trying to cut down on the carbs a bit, but this bread was just too good to resist! \n+ Oysters: Half a dozen oysters that were the special of the day from British Columbia, really fresh!\n\n-- Entrees -- \n+ Scallop Risotto (Chef Special): Love me some risotto, but this one was particularly good because the scallops were super soft, and though the dish was flavorful, it wasn't overwhelming or rich to the point that I couldn't finish it.\n+/- Loup de Mer: Lightest (in terms of flavor) fish on their menu - was really soft but I think I prefer something with more flavor to it\n+ Red Bass: More flavorful than the Loup de Mer and was just as nicely cooked!\n\n-- Dessert -- \n+ Chocolate Tartufo Bombe: I love chocolate and ice cream, so this was a great combination. The truffle powder balanced out the sweetness of the ice cream - SO GOOD! \n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this restaurant. Our waiter also told us that the restaurant will actually be rebranding into a Latin American-themed restaurant to match with their sister restaurant, The Black Sheep, in 2 weeks or so, so look out for that!"}]}
