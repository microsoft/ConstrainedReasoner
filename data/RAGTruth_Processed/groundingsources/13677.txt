Sigh. Anyway, my mum and I came here for lunch when we were checking out the Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center in SB. As usual, this is a Japanese restaurant owned by Koreans. The lady behind the counter was really friendly but the male employee (co-owner?) was definitely less so. We ordered at the counter and were given a number for our order. The food is a bit pricey, but my mum wanted Asian food so this is where we ended up. Since it was a nice day, we took a seat at a table on the patio and waited for our food and water to be brought to us.\n\nWhen the lady took our order, she had asked if we wanted anything to drink. I told her two waters, please, and she acknowledged my request. And yet the water never came... not cool.\n\nAfter a while, the male employee brought us our food. My mum had gotten the Beef Curry Bowl and I got the Dragon Roll. He also brough us utensils and one napkin each. He dropped my napkin on the floor, so he picked it up and walked away. I thought he was going to bring me another napkin, but he didn't. We chalked it up to him being weird and also very unfriendly. Is he the same unfriendly owner that the other Yelpers have been ranting about? While he wasn't outright rude to us, I can totally picture him being rude to customers.\n\nAs for the food... my roll was okay. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad, it was just fine. But my mum did not like her beef curry bowl at all. She thought the meat was mediocre and the curry was bland. She was not a fan of the food at all. While I don't think this place merits just one star, at least not in my experience, they definitely can't get higher than two stars, since they really were just meh."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2014-04-06 22:16:35", "review_text": "Not worth one dollar I paid! Half my food was cold, small portion for the $$ and dirty place. Our table was cleaned with a rag that smelled badly, food took A LONG TIME to arrive at our table. Avoid this place if possible!"}]}
