Marvel Comics superhero Hawkeye is a master with the bow and arrow. He's also got a secret super-talent at singing Ed Sheeran parodies. The" Avengers" character (played by Jeremy Renner) was a guest on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," where he got behind the piano to showcase some of his other skills. Billboard: Jimmy Fallon hits hot 100 with 'Ew!,' featuring will.i.am. "Listen I've got powers too, and they're pretty sweet. I promise I can do so much more than just archery," he crooned to a reworked version of "Thinking Out Loud". Those talents, we're told, include his collection of scarves and berets, his abilities on the trombone and he can open a pickle jar. Nope, Thor would definitely thump him in a fight. Renner has proved he's more than a one-hit wonder by starring in both "Avengers" films, the Oscar-winning "The Hurt Locker," "American Hustle: and films in the "Bourne" and "Mission Impossible" franchises.
