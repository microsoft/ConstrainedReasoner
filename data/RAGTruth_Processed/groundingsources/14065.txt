Immediately as we came in we were ignored by the host. Our server started off decent but within minutes had a change of attitude. She was quick to snatch the menus out of our hands while we were in the middle of ordering. When asking for condiments, she slammed it down on our table and rushed away. Overall felt unwelcome and uncomfortable. \n\nAs for the food, it was all extremely under seasoned. Each item tasted very bland and some items were undercooked. We ordered the pork chops and spaghetti, neither of which were good at all. Definitely would not go again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-08 03:20:17", "review_text": "Classic Santa Barbara staple. Proper cocktails, Classic portions.
