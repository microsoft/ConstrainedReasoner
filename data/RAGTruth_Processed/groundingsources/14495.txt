Which now has. The owner is a multi-millionaire. This restaurant is not meant for the average Joe. Its designed (by the owner - who is a famous interior designer) not mean for it to be anything casual. However, the new restaurant is supposed to be casual to meet the area demands. If it doesn't work out, he'll close shop and go on to his next venture. Which will be more luxury hotels. ;) The food and drinks werent bad but hopefully the casual new restaurant will suit the area better. haha"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-10-20 22:57:16", "review_text": "Came last night for a pre-theater dinner and I cannot say enough about the experience.  The service was fantastic from the minute we entered the establishment, the food recommendations given were spot on.  We weren't wanting a full blown main meal so we sampled the appetizers.  The fried cauliflower bagna cauda was superb.  Surprisingly fresh and light.  The Heirloom salad was amazing, the freshness of the tomatoes was eye opening.  The country pate, beautifully done with amazing crackers, and the corn-zucchini cakes with crab were divine.  That Chef Herman came from the Suzanne Goin restaurants is evidently in everything done here, simple and perfect from start to finish.  My new favorite place in Santa Barbara, rivals much of what's in \"town\"."}]}
