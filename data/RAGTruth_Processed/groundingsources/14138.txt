I used to go to the downtown location, but after that one closed, I haven't been to Jeannine's since. Man, have I missed it!\n\nYou order at the counter and then find a table either indoors or outdoors. The space isn't too big, so if you're with a large group, it may be difficult to find seating. Staff was super friendly.\n\nIf you're a sweet brunch person, the banana Kahlua French toast is a MUST! The challah bread is fluffy and not too eggy as some french toasts can be, and the caramelized, Kahlua glazed bananas on top are sweet goodness. The Norwegian Benedict was nice and light with the smoked salmon, tomatoes, and cucumbers. The breakfast burrito was too heavy for me though. I loved the grilled tortilla, but the fillings alone were quite mushy. The crispy home fries on the side and salsa were much needed to add a bit of crunch and to cut the richness of the cheesy eggs and bacon. Nonetheless, Jeannine's honestly has a special place in my heart, and it's because of that banana Kahlua French toast!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-12 05:15:32", "review_text": "Jeannine's is a nice breakfast and brunch spot across from the wharf with ocean views. I ordered a simple two egg breakfast with toast and fresh squeezed orange juice.  I placed a to go order and enjoyed my breakfast in the sand! \n\nThe staff were very welcoming and quickly took my order. While I waited, I noticed how cute and quaint this place is. I was quickly served and left to the beach to enjoy. I would say my breakfast was about 3.5 and the juice and service was a 5! My eggs and potatoes were meh and sourdough was good. I think next time I will try a pastry (that seems to be the thing to get at Jeannine's)."}]}
