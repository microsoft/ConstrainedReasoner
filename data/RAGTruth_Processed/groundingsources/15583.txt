{"question": "how long to bake bratwurst in the oven", "passages": "passage 1:Add sliced onion to the mixture. The initial stages of cooking the onions in the beer will soften them and allow them to take on a slight bit of the flavor of the beer. Heat the oven to 350 F and place the casserole dish into the oven with the top removed. Allow the brats to cook for approximately 30 minutes. This should allow much of the beer to evaporate as it cooks. Remove the casserole dish from the oven and pour off any beer that has not evaporated. Leave about 1 cup of the liquid in the dish with the brats and onions.\n\npassage 2:Messages: 15,800. Location: Green Bay Wisconsin. Parboil the brats for 10 minutes, brown in the broiler, and serve the next day in a Nesco floating in beer and onions. PUrists will sneer at pre cooking but it's a necessity in this case. Works for us. Use Johnsonville if you can get them. They have a Stadium brat that is already pre cooked and very tasty.\n\npassage 3:Preheat the broiler. Place the bratwursts on a broiler pan. This step is important to collect the grease that will drip from the bratwursts, which will reduce any potential flare ups in the toaster oven. Put the bratwurst in the preheated toaster oven, but not too close to the heat source (lower level). Do not leave the bratwurst unattended, as they do have a tendency to flare up and will need immediate attention to avoid the flare up getting out of control. Turn the links about every 4 minutes. The bratwurst is done once the internal temperature with a meat thermometer reaches 160F.
