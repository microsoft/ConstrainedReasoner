Delicious grilled veggies with goat cheese on my vegetarian were a perfect combination.   We'll definitely be back.

We went over and ordered a couple burritos and sat in the patio area on the side of the building, by the parking lot for the neighboring businesses.  They set the patio up for us and the kitchen wasn't quite set up so we waited a minute. \n  The burritos were excellent.  My wife got the #1 Ranchero, I got it with chorizo ($1 up charge).  Hers came with salsa rojo, mine came with verde- both good. \n    While we were sitting there we realized that one of the parking spaces in the lot next to our seats had a piano in it!  Okay...\n    Then a guy pulls into the lot on a motorcycle, hops off, lights up a cigarette, takes off his leather jacket and sits down and starts playing!  I guess that's why this is the Funk Zone!\n    I go to take our plates back in and see on the door that it was opening time.  We had showed up half an hour before opening time!  That's why the kitchen and patio weren't set up!  I can't believe they served us.  I thanked everyone profusely and walked out to the sound of live piano music.  Great breakfast experience!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-12-31 23:36:55", "review_text": "The food and service here are great.
