Iowa Ends Texas Border Mission for Governor Abbott
In May, Texas Governor Greg Abbott sent out a call to state governors asking for their support on the southern border. His request was met with overwhelming support from all 24 Republican governors. Several sent military and police support, and others sent equipment. Iowa sent 100 personnel to the border in August and 30 Public Safety Officers the following month.
On Wednesday, October 25, Governor Reynolds welcomed home the Iowa National Guard and Iowa State Patrol.
Many think governors were mainly concerned about the migrant crisis, but in fact, many saw the other crisis affecting their State. The death fentanyl brings as the drug crosses the Texas border.
At the press conference, Governor Reynolds said:
“The President’s inaction has resulted in catastrophic consequences. The Biden Administration has failed to respond to this crisis and in doing so he has failed the American people.”
“From 2020 to 2022, Iowa has seen a 500 percent increase in fentanyl seizures, a 100 percent increase in meth seizures, and we have seen drug related deaths increase by 35 percent.”
“We’ll continue to work with them and see if they need additional help or not but, you know, we continue to stand ready if they do.”
According to a press release on October 20, Governor Abbott’s Operation Lone Star has seized over 434 million doses of fentanyl.
In May, Governor Reynolds directed blame on the crisis to President Biden. She said according to ABC 6:
“The crisis we are experiencing is a direct result of a dereliction of duty by President Biden. The consequences of an open border can be felt across the country as fentanyl and the cartels threaten our communities.”
“While the White House chooses to do nothing, Republican Governors stand ready to protect our state’s interests.”
Governor Reynolds has sent support to Texas before and probably will again.
