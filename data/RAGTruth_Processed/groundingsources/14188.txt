That being said this is one of the most underrated restaurants in Santa Barbara I can easily say this is one of the top three restaurants in Santa Barbara.  My recommendation would to be to order anything with the burrata on it! The 24 hrs burrata, the pere brushchette , and the stratacciatella brushchette were all amazing! The passion fruit margarita is also to die f\n\nThank you for upping the food game in Santa Barbara Aperitivo! \n\nSide note, my other two favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara are the Black Sheep and Bouchon"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-13 02:30:17", "review_text": "No hesitation here with the 5 star review! Excellent food, stellar service,  and guaranteed high quality product every time.  When I want fresh and delicious pasta, Aperativo is my go-to.  I appreciate their dedication and consistency. Highly recommend for date night since its a cozy intimate venue with an open kitchen. I'm also a big fan of Tues pasta club for take out,  excellent wine pairings every time."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-07 01:01:24", "review_text": "I ordered the box of wine for pick up and was not disappointed. They were all wonderful wines! I highly recommend it AND the Pasta Club. The pasta selections are very flavorful and pair wonderfully with the wine. I plan to order everytime I am in town."}]}
