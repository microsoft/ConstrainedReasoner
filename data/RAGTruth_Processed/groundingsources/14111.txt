They have a huge selection of sandwiches from a single size all the way to a family size all made right in front of you.\n\nMy Family often goes for the burger special which is a cheeseburger, fries and drink for about $8 they also have a veggie burger YUMMY!  Staff is always nice but sometimes orders can be a little slow but since they make the food in front of you I never mind. The place looks the same from 20 years ago when I was in high school so it can use a remodel for sure but its clean and good."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-11-10 23:03:46", "review_text": "Sad to have to give them a Two.   Place is not the same.  Been here a few times for the chicken club. They put cold chicken just a few pieces.  Happened a few times.  Not coming back"}]}
