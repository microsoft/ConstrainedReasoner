NO. This place literally backs up their levels of heat. Every single place I've gone to, (in my opinion) their level of medium for example is straight mild. And I promise, I'm no spicy expert and/or handler of heat lol. Plus the flavor of the chicken to me is unbelievably tasty. As a local, it's extremely hard to find good chicken, especially fried chicken, here in Santa Barbara.\n\nAside from the chicken, I have no complaints about the sides. The Mac n cheese--amazing. The coleslaw--it's the perfect balance of sweet and vinegar. The potato salad has bacon bits! And kettle chips are just the cherry on top.\n\nThis place is relatively new, and I believe they've just popped up long term in the Public Market, so of course it's going to take a short amount of time to work out the kinks as far as service goes. You can tell already that they are truly invested and trying their hardest. Just give it time.\n\nAs far as prices...people, come on...this is Santa Barbara. Y'all should know why the prices are the way they are. Plus everything that most restaurants in town source are from local areas. You're getting quality...not quantity. \n\nJust try this place. I'll be going here every month."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-27 05:11:29", "review_text": "Was so happy when I ended up at the SB Public Market on one of the days this pop up was up and running!\n\nThe eponymous hot chicken sandwich comes in mild, medium, or hot. I pushed my luck and went with the medium, and it packed a good punch. Plenty of heat, but not unbearably so. It was a delicious mess to eat. \n\nThe sandwich itself came with some basic chips included. As others have mentioned though, the cost of the sides and drinks can turn the meal into a pricier than average lunch. I agree with the sentiment that some sort of combo meal would be great, as the potato salad and macaroni and cheese both look great as sides.\n\nExpect at least a 20 minute wait for your food to be ready, but worth the wait for a phenomenal sandwich!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-11 15:18:23", "review_text": "Stumbled upon Matty's at the public market pop up. Hadn't planned on fried chicken but felt like we might be passing up a rare opportunity so went for a smaller menu item to try it, the flaquito. We were warned that medium was pretty spicy, yet we went for it. I like a good kick but with this place I'll def go for mild next visit  The chicken was cooked perfectly,  fried fresh and very moist. House pickles were very tastey and a great compliment to the firey chicken.  I'm looking forward to going back and see if  the mild also requires tums. Delicious burn!"}]}
