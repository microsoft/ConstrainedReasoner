We ordered off of grub hub and it was never picked up / delivered so we had to go pick up our meal. The ladies ensured that our meal would still be hot after the 40 delay and offered us free cookies and drinks to make up for what was not their mistake. Thanks homies! We really appreciate it and will be in in-person next time"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-11-09 19:50:16", "review_text": "The best fish tacos in Goleta.\nTons of options for vegetarians, pescatarians and vegans."}]}
