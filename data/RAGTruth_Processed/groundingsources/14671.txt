She was covering the ENTIRE patio by herself on a Friday night. I have a feeling people were out sick or something. Regardless, she was friendly and very efficient when she could be! \n\nThe food though? Man, it was just okaaaay. I really mean that. It was edible but not really enjoyable. If we hadn't been with a group of friends celebrating, it would have been a bigger deal. We were kind of distracted by having fun so it wasn't the end of the world. \n\nOur worst experience though, was takeout. It was a hassle because they got our order wrong and we didn't notice until we got home. When we called to see what could be done, there was some serious attitude. I never said anything negative and was friendly. I just said that we had just realized our order was wrong and asked what our options were. The person I talked to sighed heavily and said, \"....well what do you want me to say?\"  Uhhh, not that? \n\nI just gave up and we ate the wrong order, hoping it was going to be better than what we'd actually ordered. \n\nSpoiler: it wasn't."}]}
