The Prosecco, beet and citrus terrine, and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was great and we should have stopped there.  We spent more time waiting for food, to take orders, and the bill than we did eating and drinking. When a plate of food is served, the protein should face the diner so they don't have to use their napkin to turn around a screaming hot plate in order to eat their food. We ordered Prosecco and the menu (with wine list) was taken. We eventually asked another waiter for a wine list and apparently the fact it was on the table again wasn't hint enough.  But then we never saw our waiter again before another server delivered the food. Apparently wine was not an option for us.  Hint: we wanted wine.  Did I not realize it's a self serve joint? We were seated immediately next to the entrance of the outdoor seating area (very nice), where apparently 3-4 servers decide to hang out while while waiting for something to do. While all seemed very nice, not exactly great ambiance compared to others who were seated further down, and frankly, seemed to get more attention. Three scallops, mashed potato's and asparagus for $45 seems a bit overpriced even in this area and at that service level is a really disappointing. We finally asked for the bill so we could get up and leave."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 23:47:16", "review_text": "Spectularly beautiful, feels mediterrean .... we were totally geared up to love it. The bread serve with nicely creamy butter with Hawaiian salt on top is super nice. I do have to say that the salmon was served with sauce, sauce, sauce, sauce and sauce. It detracted from experiencing the wonder of the fish itself. It was rich and maybe I eat too lean most of the time because it almost was nauseatingly rich. I wanted to love everything about this place and I do plan to return and voyage into other menu items carefully making sure I cover how rich the dish is and how saucey. The waiter was great, not intrusive. I have to give them another try."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 00:57:48", "review_text": "Absolutely delicious and great restaurant. Service was outstanding and quick. Came here for my fianc\u00e9's birthday. We dinned outside and it was perfect and hope if we are ever back in the area that we come here again. It's a little pricey but worth every dollar. I ordered the gnocchi and my fianc\u00e9 had the black ink spaghetti. We also ordered calamari. Each one of these dishes were delicious and portions are a good size!"}]}
