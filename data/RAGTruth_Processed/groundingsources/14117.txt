It's one of my favorite bars I've ever been to. Very relaxed, speakeasy vibe with friendly staff that are happy to make just about any drink you could want. The drinks are strong, their records are great and it's cozy enough that you'll want to stay for hours."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2022-01-04 01:15:25", "review_text": "The one establishment we were unfortunate to not lose with Covid19. Bartenders are not as important as they want to believe or treat you as they are. Smh. @bartenders- your welcome for the business, how about some mutual gratitude instead of clap when you walk in attitude. You think this is our honor to be in your presence. How about being human, and being in service, as you are in the service industry"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-13 07:47:07", "review_text": "There's a reason Imperial has garnered five-star reviews from almost anyone has reviewed it: it's because it's REALLY GOOD, y'all. \n\nThis place has a distinct speakeasy vibe. Located in the back side of a bike shop, it's pretty easy to miss (hint: look for a sign that says \"Ba'k Dor Lounge\"). On the plus side, there's a parking lot and plenty of spaces!\n\nThe decor here is amazing. An impressive vinyl collection punctuates the tiki-cum-speakeasy vibe, and the lighting, furniture, and noise levels are all conducive to catching up with friends, or maybe even meeting some new ones... ;) On the intercom, I heard Tom Jones and Buena Vista Social Club and I was reaaaally enjoying the vibe. The outdoor area was a tad chilly, but offered even more room and visual diversions. Taking a seat here felt cozy and welcoming.\n\nDonald greeted me upon my entering and steered me to a fantastic cocktail called a Clover Club. Raspberry, lemon, egg white and gin took their turns dancing on my tongue and the result was tremendous. I got a taste of the Oaxacanut and a mystery Holiday Special and those were both also to die for.\n\nThere are also plenty of food options in the area if the bar nuts that Donald and the crew serve don't sate your hunger.\n\nCould not throw enough support behind this business. Get there already!"}]}
