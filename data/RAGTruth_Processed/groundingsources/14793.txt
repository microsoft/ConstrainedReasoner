Very friendly staff, and very tasty food! \n\nI'm sitting here eating the chimichanga special from today and the pulled pork is some of the best I have tasted - taste and texture. \n\nThis isn't a one off either, I'm consistently impressed by the quality and variety of the food available.  Recently discovered their breakfast burritos too, they're delicious.\n\nWas going to send this as a thank you email, hopefully they'll see the message here.  Thank you guys!  Keep doing what you're doing!"}]}
