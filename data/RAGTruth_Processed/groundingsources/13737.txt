My eggs and my wife's omelet were done just right. The coffee was hot & fresh. I should have thought to ask the brand name of the coffee because it was delicious.\nOur server was also very good and the food was delivered to our table hot, which in some restaurants is a challenge.\nThis restaurant is very convenient to Cottage Hospital, the Sansum Clinic and other surrounding medical offices.\nI highly recommend giving The Live Oak Cafe a try."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-18 22:27:46", "review_text": "Absolutely loved my breakfast. I got a skillet with eggs, kale/spinach/quinoa side and it was oh so tasty. My best friend and I were on the way to the Santa Barbara Mission from LA and we left really early thinking there would be a ton of traffic. Much to our surprise, it wasn't that bad so we decided to stop by and grab a bite to eat. The location is real easy to pass by, but there was plenty of parking, and no one was there which was nice. I definitely want to stop by again because the food was healthy, tasty, and fresh!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-17 03:24:08", "review_text": "What a surprising treat! Came here for lunch to get quality food and avoid crowds. The atmosphere is quiet, comfy and green. The service was great and oh the FRIED RICE! It's delicious with their in house cured bacon. Highly recommend. The pork buns were a special treat to find and very good. The bacon waffle was delicious as well, made with high quality ingredients. It was a great experience."}]}
