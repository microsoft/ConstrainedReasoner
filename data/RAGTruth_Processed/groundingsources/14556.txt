It's a no-nonsense setting good for a heavy pour. The current location doesn't have the same level of nostalgia that the original spot next to the Paseo Nuevo movie theater did, but it's a lot larger with a hidden few seating rooms on the western side of the venue. Parking is nearly non-existent with the small area currently being used as a parklet, but you shouldn't be drinking and driving anyway! Take an Uber!\n\nI've been when there's a crowd but prefer coming on a quieter evening mid-week. For being on an extremely busy corner, I'm in awe over just how small-town the interior feels. The service is very personal which I appreciate. I've been served by Jennifer, the bartender, and feel that she does a great job. \n\nI was here the other night and happened to walk into a small, impromptu stand-up comedy show. I didn't expect to be entertained but it was a fun time nonetheless!\n\nMel's may seem like a drive-by, but stop by and see just how special of a spot it really is."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2020-08-02 01:26:34", "review_text": "Little local spot. Decent beer. Pool table so time too. Fun during comedy nights. Managements seems a little unprofessional at times.
