There is truly a pantheon of fine sandwich shops in our fair town and Ike's, with it's sole, somewhat squalid little location next to the 7-11 on Mission, has pushed it's way into that top tier. \n\nI've been there twice now and heard similar stories from friends and fam, and Ike's is the bomb. Their bread is fresh and tasty (I like the sourdough better than the Dutch Crunch, but you can't go wrong either way), the variety is hard to beat, the sauces are tasty, and they cook them oh so right. I've tried the steak sandwich and the three cheese and they were both on hit. \n\nNormally I'd dock a star or two for so many SF Giants references, or the weird little location, or the strange hours (closes at 6?), but the food and service are so legit that I'm not even going to go there. This spot is a legitimate contender with all the big boys in town - Valentinos, South Coast, Panino, and Sam's. Definitely worth picking up on your way to the Rose Garden or if you want to enjoy it in one of their creepy little booths staring at the weird ceiling."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-22 21:21:45", "review_text": "The sandwiches here are awesome!  Although I despise the name of many of them (a lot of SF sports themed, while I'm an LA fan), I looked past that and enjoyed a couple sandwiches named after Giants players.  \nThe service was good, friendly and helpful.  Sandwiches were ready not too long after ordering them.  \nThe star of the sandwiches was the Dutch Crunch bread.  That is one of the most awesome breads for sandwiches, crunchy on the outside and soft interior. \nI'd definitely come back to try some of their other creations!"}]}
