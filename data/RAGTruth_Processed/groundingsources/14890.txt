I had previously booked New Black for my upcoming wedding. They skipped town without telling us, taking our $500 deposit with them. After hearing that they had gone out of business from other local food trucks, I tried contacting them several times to get my money back, but with no response. It was not until my fianc\u00e9 found their personal information (their personal cell phone number and home address) and threatened to show up at their doorstep that they gave us our deposit back. \n\nFor those of you who have them booked for an upcoming event, I would contact them immediately and try to get your deposit back as soon as possible. Sketchy!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2012-10-29 04:43:25", "review_text": "They only have three sandwiches available and they were out of one - the Kobe brisket. They recommended the Jidori Chicken over the pork. I wonder if it was because they had more chicken than pork. Either way, it was $7 for a substantial sandwich. I would have preferred to pay $4 for a smaller portion so I could try other things. The sandwich was tasty and the chow-chow was a good complement to the chicken. It could have had a bit more acidity though.\n\nThe flavors are good, but with such a small menu, I was disappointed they were out of something before they even opened."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2012-10-01 03:53:01", "review_text": "The food is okay.  I'm used to having my BBQ spicy.  When they asked me how I enjoyed it I told them it was okay, I was just expecting some kick to it.  Then they quipped how \"If you want it spicy try some tobasco sauce, we wanted to make it good\".\n\nI have no idea what to make of that statement.  Besides that, there was not a great amount of choices.  Basically 3 choices, which are all sandwich based."}]}
