This place was/is very empty for a good reason-- although the concept of having a good grilled cheese place sounds enticing, the actual food was extremely underwhelming. I ordered the grilled cheese with mac n' cheese for $9 and was given half a sandwich with the thinnest layer of mac n cheese inside. On the side were 5 tater tots and HALF a pickle (they don't even bother putting a whole pickle!). A majority of us college students in IV can't afford bougie mediocre grilled cheese for $9-$13. Not sure how long this place is going to last here."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2018-06-08 21:10:12", "review_text": "You win some, you lose some. And just like the game of cornhole I played here, it was a loss.\n\nHaving tried the original Grilled Cheese Truck in L.A., I had high expectations for the bright yellow truck stop. Unfortunately, the times I have tried it, those expectations were not met.\n\nI had their signature cheesy mac and rib melt, the healthier not-so-classic melt, and a s'mores melt on three separate occasions. Unfortunately for them, the bread they use here is drier than the sand on Isla Vista's beaches. It's as if they pre-toast the bread in the morning and just warm it up in a toaster oven before slapping some cheese on it. The meat, as a result, is dried out by the time it gets to the paper boats their melts are served on.\n\nThe best things to order are the sweet potato tater tots, partially because there is no dry bread involved, and partially because you should never say no to tater tots. Prices are high for no discernible quality and sandwiches the size of the regular Wonder Bread loafs at the supermarket.\n\nCustomer service here is sorely lacking. It seems to be worse than other student-run restaurants managed in I.V. The sandwiches take unbelievably long considering how carelessly constructed they look. On several occasions, the staff have seemed more likely to hang out in the kitchen or talk to friends who pass by in their cars instead of running the register. But hey, when there's that little business, I don't blame them for seeking other avenues of entertainment.\n\nThey have been trying some marketing tactics to get people in there -- a board out front says that their \"plain and simple\" melt is $2 now from 1-4 p.m., but I don't know many people who are excited for grilled cheese during those hours. A friend of mine walked past the establishment and heard them calling out \"the next five people will get $2 off of their sandwiches!\" Not many scuttled in after that.\n\nIs this place cursed? Probably. I've never seen more than five people eating there in one go, and I pass by it at least once a day. Hope it improves instead of going the way of Santa Ynez Burrito and Kogilicious."}]}
