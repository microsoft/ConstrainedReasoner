{"question": "which type of diabetes is worse type 1 or type 2", "passages": "passage 1:With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin \u2014 a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells \u2014 or doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. Untreated, type 2 diabetes can be life-threatening.\n\npassage 2:More specifically, diabetes is a condition that affects the body's ability to use glucose (a type of sugar) as fuel. Glucose is a form of carbohydrate that comes from foods such as breads, cereals, pasta, rice, potatoes, fruits and some vegetables.\n\npassage 3:Now, the cause of type 2 diabetes is quite different from type 1. The cause of type 2 diabete is primarily a complicated medical condition called 'insulin resistance.' In fact, in the early stages of type 2 diabetes, there's plenty of insulin around, it just doesn't work well.\n\n"}
