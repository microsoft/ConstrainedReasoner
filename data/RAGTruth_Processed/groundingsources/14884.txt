It's literally junk. Except you pay $45 for pizza that is beyond mediocre. Way overpriced flavorless dough with basically no cheese and and a smattering of toppings.  The only way this would be acceptable is if you were baked out of your skull."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-08-28 06:25:47", "review_text": "Pizza was pretty tasty, got the Cotto Carne, but I ordered some garlic bread which was a little than I desired.  It was \"French Bread\" but it was the bread you would buy at the grocery store in the 8-pack of sandwich bread.  Expected the loaf of bread you use for bbqs"}]}
