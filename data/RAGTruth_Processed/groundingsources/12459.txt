{"question": "how to grow healthy tomatoes in a container", "passages": "passage 1:Transplanting Tips for Container Tomatoes. * A 5-gallon container is perfect for the tomato and easy to move if needed. * Clay pots tend to dry out quickly unless they are glazed or painted. * Drill multiple 1/4 inch holes in the bottom of the tomato container. Don\u2019t try to get by with just one drainage hole. * Place 2 to 3 inches of gravel in the bottom for drainage. * Fill the container about 3/4 full with bagged potting soil to start. As the container tomato baby grows bigger, add fresh soil to the top to support the growing stem. * Plant 3 or 4 marigolds with each tomato to help keep bugs away. * Container tomatoes should receive full sun (about 8 hours a day).\n\npassage 2:The hotter the temperature and the smaller the container, the more watering you will have to do. Mulch can help conserve soil moisture. While you are checking your containers for water, keep an eye out for insects and diseases. The same pests bother tomatoes whether you grow the plants in the ground or in containers.\n\npassage 3:To avoid damaging the plants put the supports in the containers before you plant the seedlings. Fill each container three-quarters full. Plant each seedling so the soil is just below the first set of true leaves, which are the leaves that look like tomato leaves. Firm the soil around each plant, then water thoroughly.\n\n"}
