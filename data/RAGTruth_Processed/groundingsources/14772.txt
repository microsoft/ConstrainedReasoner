We have tried other French restaurants in SB, but have enjoyed the food from here the most. We had such a great experience and definitely recommend this restaurant for a rehearsal dinner. \nLilia was an absolute pleasure to work with and was very accommodating. She created a delightful menu and beautiful atmosphere in the back patio for our event. The service, food, atmosphere and everything was exactly what we hoped for and more!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2016-07-23 21:29:51", "review_text": "The entrecote frite and mussels were good.
