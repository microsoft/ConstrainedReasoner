{"question": "what's the difference between fuel sending unit and fuel pump", "passages": "passage 1:Fuel Pump. The fuel pump has three functions: to deliver enough fuel to supply the requirements of an engine under all operating conditions, to maintain enough pressure in the line between the carburetor and the pump to keep the fuel from boiling, and to prevent vapor lock.\n\npassage 2:The fuel sending unit assembly may be a combination of the electric fuel pump, the filter, the strainer, and the electronic device used to measure the amount of fuel in the tank via a float attached to a sensor which sends data to the dash-mounted fuel gauge. The fuel pump by itself is a relatively inexpensive part.\n\npassage 3:With the whole unit you will get a new pressure regulator. Its alot easier to change out, Plus its all new, And if you have a problem you dont have to dissemble it to figure it out. Sometimes the valve in the regulator/pump lets the fuel drain back to the tank which is the reason for the long starting. In the long run its worth the extra $$ for the whole unit. Good luck.\n\n"}
