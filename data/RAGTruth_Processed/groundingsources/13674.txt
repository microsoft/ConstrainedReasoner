Ordered with a scoop of chicken salad, it is the perfect meal. The mixed greens are fresh with the proper ratio of walnuts and Gorgonzola. The chicken salad is tasty and tender, but seems to be lacking in something for added flavor, a little lemon or dill perhaps for some added zest. Ordering is easy, and there is ample dining outdoors. Fresco Cafe is definitely on my go to list for a delicious meal."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 02:24:26", "review_text": "I've eaten at Fresco on and off for the past 15 years. I stopped by on 12/30 at 4:30 pm to pick up a quick order of fries, soup and desserts. After paying, I walked by the open kitchen to wait for my order and noticed that one of the cooks was NOT WEARING A MASK and was USING HIS HANDS TO EAT WHILE ALSO PREPPING FOOD IN THE KITCHEN. I was shocked, especially based upon the skyrocketing COVID cases in the past few days. I spoke with the manager and asked for a refund. He was very nice but explained that this was his first shift and he did not know how to issue a refund. I asked for the contact information for the owner and he was unable to provide this (said they were out of business cards). He promised me that if I left my number someone would contact me."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-22 20:12:27", "review_text": "Really great locals joint... used to live/work nearby and would eat here almost every day. Huge selection of different types of food, good cupcakes & chocolate cake, Arnold Palmer unlimited refills, friendly & efficient staff! Delicious salads the Gorgonzola walnut is classic. Their Saturday special Jack Daniels ribs & fries with Dijon are phenomenal. Best ribs in town with Carlitos. A terrific spot where you'll always know what to expect. The wraps are delicious as well. Pretty sure they have largest, most diverse salad selection in town. Their Ahi club is all worldly see photo. French club sandwiches are so half assed. Frescos is quality & savoir faire in club sandwich department."}]}
