Three Pickles offers, true to its name, three varieties of pickles: spears, slices, and pepperoncini, all available gratis at a pickle bar, which is something I'd love to see wherever sandwiches are sold.\n\nWe met up with friends at the park the day before Thanksgiving and ordered sandwiches (and pickles) to pick up for a picnic lunch. Our friends ordered and we picked up, and both parts of the process seemed fast and easy enough.\n\nI ordered the house sub with Italian cold cuts. The \"sub our way\" came on a roll with diced tomato, onion, dill pickle, olive oil, oregano, mayo, choice of mustard, and choice of cheese, with a few optional add-ons. I picked dijon and provolone and added the pepperoncini and giardiniera (both free), as well as avocado. I got the regular size, which was smaller than I expected but plenty for one meal and about right for $9.50, though the $1.99 for the pitiable amount of avocado was a rip-off. The sandwich was good, if not especially exciting, and I enjoyed it with lots of pickled pepperoncini.\n\nI'd recommend Three Pickles if you're in the mood for a sandwich with lots of pickles. I am often in this mood, so I'll probably order from here again."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-03 20:39:41", "review_text": "The food's good but they way overcharge on DoorDash! $14.70 For a tiny sandwich and they didn't give me the pickle pack I ordered $3.50... never again."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-10-30 21:10:47", "review_text": "Just looking for a quick sandwich late lunch.
