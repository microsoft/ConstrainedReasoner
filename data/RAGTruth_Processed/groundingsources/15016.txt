We had patio a table on the patio which was great for people watching.  The place wasn't too busy, but it was a night of the art walk so there was a good amount of people there.  \n\nOur waiter was EXCELLENT. I believe his name was Ricky?  He was incredibly friendly and very helpful when it came to questions of the menu and suggestions for meal choices.  He made sure that our drinks were always full and that we were happy with our meals, without being over the top or intrusive.\n\nAnd his meal suggestions were great, all three of us were very pleased with what we ordered.  From the soup he suggested, to the salads and quesadillas.  Our drinks were great as well.  We had a couple of mimosas (which were a little weak, but i prefer to only add orange juice to mine for coloring purposes) but the bloody mary was great!\n\nDefinitely would come back here again"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2012-01-17 02:50:59", "review_text": "Came in on New Year's Day, and were highly, highly disappointed.  They were \"swamped\" (although it didn't seem overly crowded), and when I got up to (politely) let them know that we had been sitting at our table for 15 minutes without even a glance in our direction, I was told that I would \"just have to be patient.\"\n\nWe were discouraged by our server from ordering an appetizer because they were \"so busy.\"  Instead, we were promised bread and butter and had to ask again for it 3 times before it ever came out, after our meals had finally arrived.\nThe water they served had a funny, tap-watery taste to it.\nI ordered the Chicken Cobb salad; wimpy and served with completely burnt and inedible bacon.\nMy husband ordered the Chicken chili and said it tasted canned, bland, and the chicken was tough.\nHe also had a grilled chicken sandwich which he said was \"terrible.\"\n\nThankfully we had a coupon so we didn't pay full price!  \n \nTerrible service, terrible food.  Really disappointed.  Never coming back."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2012-01-16 21:03:46", "review_text": "We ended up at the Cafe Shell by accident after leaving the restaurant next door because not one person acknowledged our table after sitting there for thirty minutes.  The Cafe Shell was a pleasant surprise.  The service was prompt and the food was good. Nice options for lunch included salads, sandwiches, soup, chili The new owner stopped by our table. As it turns out he is from Ireland, has lived in SB for many years and just bought the Shell Cafe four months ago. He does plan to make some improvements to the restaurant space and possibly tweak the menu a bit. We will for sure go back again& do want to check out happy hour. It is also a fun spot to sit and people watch.  We were there one day during the week between Christmas and New Years 2011."}]}
