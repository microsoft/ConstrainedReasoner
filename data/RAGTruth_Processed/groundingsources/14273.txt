Highly recommended!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 18:01:32", "review_text": "Amazing! Both the food and service were amazing. I'm Vegan and was able to customize their hash & it was delicious! The menu is a bit small, but it keeps the food good quality & coming out fast. It's not cheap, but the quality was worth it. Coffee was fantastic & they have a self serve water station with lovely glass bottles. Would recommend & come again."}]}
