The staff are super friendly and it's cool to see the fresh faces as of late. \n\nThe food is typical Jersey Mike's, but somehow it tastes better here."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2019-01-12 00:10:55", "review_text": "Came here yesterday with my boyfriend. We have gone to many other Jersey Mike's before and never had a problem. \nHowever this time we got bad food poisoning from our sandwiches and are still exhibiting symptoms from it. \nVery unpleasant experience, especially since we got 2 giants in hopes to get 2 meals out of it. \nInstead we got one meal and a date with the bathroom. \n\nAvoid this location. Not worth the risk."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-10-01 00:26:45", "review_text": "Great service! Best chicken Parm than most other jersey mikes locations!
