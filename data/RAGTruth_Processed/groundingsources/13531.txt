Prince Harry's Departure from Royalty Was Already Planned
A Long-Planned Strategy, Not a Sudden Whim
Prince Harry's decision to distance himself from the royal household was not a sudden move, but a long-planned strategy. The Duke of Sussex had always intended to carve his own path.
Reports have surfaced suggesting that Prince Harry's choice to step back from the royal family was not an impromptu decision, but rather a path he had planned to tread long before his marriage to Meghan Markle.
The Duke of Sussex had reportedly always intended to "do his own thing," as per insights from 2019.
The plans to split the royal household and staff between Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William, were already in motion ahead of Prince Archie's birth.
Royal correspondent Omid Scobie stated that Kensington Palace aides confirmed these plans were in place "long before Meghan even came on the scene."
Scobie shared, "Kensington Palace aides have told me that they always knew that when he got married and wasn't sort of the spare wheel, that he would go off and do his own thing with his partner and they would very much live under their own household with their own staff."
The split was not a sign of discord but a strategic move to accommodate the growing families of the princes.
In 2022, Bryony Gordon, a journalist and friend of the Sussexes, reiterated Harry's long-standing desire to step away from royal duties. Gordon told that Harry "wanted out from the crazy cult of royalty" since childhood, and Meghan Markle was a "catalyst" for this.
The Duke himself confirmed this sentiment on the Armchair Expert podcast in May 2021, expressing his reluctance to be part of the royal "business model."
This revelation sheds new light on the Sussexes' decision to step back from royal duties, emphasizing that it was not a sudden whim but a long-considered decision.
