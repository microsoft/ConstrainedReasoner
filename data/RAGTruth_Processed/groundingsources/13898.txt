2023 Capitol Tree: 'Almost Heaven' to D.C.
The Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia will provide the U.S. Capitol with a holiday tree in 2023. Throughout this month, there will be various activities, events, and celebrations as the tree makes its way to Washington, D.C.

Every year since 1970, the USDA Forest Service has provided our nation’s capital with a tall and sturdy Christmas tree harvested off national forests from coast to coast and even Alaska.
It's important to note that the U.S. Capitol tree should not be mistakenn with the National Christmas Tree that sits on the Ellipse just south of the White House. The most notable difference is the size. For instance, the White House’s National Christmas Tree, lit by the First Family, is a living fixed tree about 47 feet tall, In contrast, the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree has the ability to reach an impressive height of nearly 75 feet once the star is placed atop it.
One notable distinction lies in the ornaments adorning both the White House's National Christmas Tree and the U.S. Capitol tree. Renowned artists, handpicked for the occasion, meticulously craft the White House's ornaments, with each state being represented by a unique piece of art. Conversely, the U.S. Capitol tree's decorations, while also handmade, take a different approach. Hundreds of children from the hosting state contribute to the creation of these ornaments, thus earning the moniker "the People's Tree."
Once the tree is transported to Washington, D.C., individuals residing in or visiting the capital will have the opportunity to marvel at the tree's beauty round the clock, from the moment it arrives until the dawn of January 1st.
