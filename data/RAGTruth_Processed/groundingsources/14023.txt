I got two cups for the salsa bar and I got my order and walked it home for about the 1/2 mile walk.\n\nThe picture isn't the best, because my bag tilted a little on the way, but you can see how much meat they give you, they definitely don't skimp. The meat is seared and spiced perfectly and the tortillas were perfect. I zapped it in the microwave for 30 seconds, just to make sure it didn't cool down on the walk home in this lovely little beach town.\n\nBoth of the salsas were tasty, but I liked the red one a little more. I had an IPA to go with them and they were a perfect two taco dinner. Check these guys out!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-28 05:18:53", "review_text": "I purchase marinated taco meats from them and they are absolutely the best!

I am from Los Angeles and our Mexican food is hard to compare to other places. My family and I ordered posole, Mexican rice, and carne asada fries. The posole was my favorite."}]}
