Meghan Markle's family revealed a throwback photo that she "Never Wanted The World To See"
When Meghan Markle's divided family first made public a picture of the Duchess, it was believed to be a picture she never intended the public to see.
In April of last year, the family's final interview and a 7NEWS Australia special preceded the release of the nostalgic photo on social media.
It featured Prince Harry's spouse grinning and averting her gaze from an unidentified activity.
The Duchess of Sussex was spotted with a napkin placed inside a low-buttoned white collared shirt.
She appeared to be in a restaurant because her hair was in a low bun pieces were falling down her face, and platters of food were visible in front of her.
Journalist Taylor Auerbach posted the picture on X, now known as Twitter, stating that Meghan "never wanted the world to see" it.
"Who tucks the napkin into their top?," one commenter asked, in response to criticism that the photo appeared "lower class" on the internet. Extremely low class."
Several more never-before-seen images of the Duchess were shown in the episode.
The family special featured Meghan's childhood. Her family talked about where she would be "without her dad" and how she felt about Prince Harry.
Samantha, her sister, stated in the trailer: "If it weren't for dad, she would still be a waitress."
Samantha once stated of Harry and her relationship, "They're unhealthy for each other." This partnership is poisonous."
Thomas Jr., Meghan's estranged brother, asserted that they are "not going away" in spite of rumors that this will be their final interview.
He went on, "This is going to completely change everything."
