My soul wasn't stirred.  Here I am on a Saturday, looking for God in all the wrong places.  All I had were the gluten free chocolate chip cookie and the Rose matcha green tea, and well...My thoughts?\n\n1.) I like the pools of chocolate in the cookie, but I wish it were chewier.  Gluten free anything always feels like it's missing something...\n\n(gluten? Lol)\n\nGluten is the glue that holds everything together, and without it, everything falls apart.  I mean this on a spiritual level.\n\n2.)  And the rose matcha fell flat somewhere.  It was neither pronounced in rose or matcha flavor.  You need to pick a side.  You need to make a choice.  You need to commit.  You need to be STRONG with one flavor and have a HINT of the other, but you kinda did neither.   You were half-assed polyamorous.  You didn't pick a winner and run with it.  You shied away from both.  It was colored green iced water.\n\nAt the end of the day, I feel some potential here.  I suggest going back to the drawing board."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-09-01 17:26:19", "review_text": "Dope coffee. Awesome toast. Tight art. Cool hangs. 10/10 cooler than every other coffee shop in SB. Also, p sure the name \"Breakfast\" is ironic so for every lamo who complained about that below just didn't ~get it~"}]}
