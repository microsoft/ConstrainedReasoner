When I asked him to check with the kitchen he initially said no. After much pressing on this he finally went back and asked. I learned that the blue corn tortillas (which are gluten free at corazon) are not gluten free at the project. When he finally asked the kitchen they let him know they did have some pre made gluten free corn tortillas on hand that they could use to make a taco. It always is odd to me when restaurants make corn tortillas which are traditionally gluten free with gluten, this should be more clearly identified on a menu and staff should be more knowledgeable and willing to accommodate. \n\nOnce we finally got through the pain of ordering with our waiter we got our appetizer. We ordered the \"avocado\" which we assumed would be chips and guac. It was a little different but was delicious! The avocado dip had some sort of different season in it which made it delightful, would definitely recommend this! \n\nAs for the tacos, we all thought the old project menu had better options and decided we'd prefer to just get the tacos at corazon as we thought they are ultimately better.\n\nLove the fun vibe of the project, but we'll keep going to Corazon at public market where they have everything down to an art and customer service seems to be be more on par."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-10-10 17:32:30", "review_text": "Went here for dinner and had the steak and fries, as well as the mussels and clams. The steak had a chimichurri sauce that really overpowered the whole plate. I left most of it because of the overpowering taste, and it was not tender. The mussels and clams were pretty good, but not great (maybe a 3.5 out of 5 review, for that plate). The restaurant wasn't too busy and we never got a water refill. 2 stars for the pricey chewy steak  and subpar service."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-09-25 02:55:18", "review_text": "This was exceptional Mexican food.
