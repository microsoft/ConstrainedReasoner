My friends and I always go here when we go downtown. Great crowd and music. However the best part about this place is the staff! We LOVE Lala the bartender. She is literally the coolest and most personal bartender! I literally cannot put into words how great she made our experience! SHE IS OUR MF GIRL!! . We literally look forward to going to Backstage just for her!!!"}]}
