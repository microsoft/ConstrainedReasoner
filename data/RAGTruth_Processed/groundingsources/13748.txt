I particularly LOVE real handmade pasta! Via Maestra is a local favorite hidden in a shopping center off of upper State Street. Outside seating is reminiscent of laneway seating in Italy. I was surprised upon entering the restaurant because it has qualities of an Italian deli with a small selection of imported Italian goods to buy. If you'd rather not dine in, you can order food to pick up. Or you can skip a meal and go straight for dessert with a nice assortment of gelatos (available for testing) and pastries/cakes. The desserts are made by an outside Italian style baker, not in house. Typically this would bother me, but as they import real Italian cake, this only encourages future patronage. Their desserts are delicious. My husband and I shared a pistachio cheesecake and fruit tart. My absolute favorites on their menu include the arugula (rocket) salad with delicious cheese and fresh cut tomatoes, and their pumpkin ravioli with sage butter sauce. Oh. My. Goodness. If i could choose a last meal on earth, the pumpkin ravioli and arugula salad with light lemon vinaigrette, win!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-15 02:32:15", "review_text": "Love this restaurant and they seemed to have really improved their DoorDash game too.

We were staying in the area and our hotel was down the street. Service and food were excellent. Very quaint family feel restaurant. I liked that they had the option to sit outside due to Covid concerns and we felt the overall experience was just lovely. Food tasted so good and waiters were very attentive. We had both a dinner and a breakfast. Dinner was a Pumpkin Ravioli and Linguini Gamberoni and breakfast was Smoked Salmon and Goat Cheese with Spinach and an appetizer of fig jam and something that reminded us of a fluffy sweet pastry or cheese with our bread. Dessert Tiramisu and cappuccinos reminded us of being back in Europe. Nothing lacked in the overall experience. Can't wait to go back."}]}
