The Waterline is one of those buildings - and it's such a site to see. The developer successfully took its former shell and transformed it into a total work of art. Talk about giving a space a new lease on life. \n\nThis venue is very large, ultra-modern, and still manages to offer the character and charm of its former glory. Everywhere you turn, there's something neat to be seen. The space is home to a small eatery, a winery, two brewhouses, a boutique, and a variety of hidden office suites. There are two well-designed side patios which may be enjoyed by patrons from all walks. \n\nThe company I work for rents the space for their annual holiday party and it is always such a hit. It's large, well-lit, and just plain cool. Santa Barbara needs more of this sort of redevelopment."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-03-14 05:21:51", "review_text": "I was running errands in Sb and went to The Waterline on the recommendation of a friend. Super cool spot, lots of friendly staff to help you with menu options. I went with the popular rockfish tacos! So good! Great local wines and beers. I chose a rose' after talking with the knowledgeable  bartender. They also support local artists so after eating, I cruised around to check out the current installation. One featured artist is David J. Diamant. His show is Sunset Surfers. Not sure why this is reported closed. It is definitely OPEN!

You can order food and eat in the wine or beer tasting room. Three stars because of crowdedness and heat-not a great combo!"}]}
