Smaller with less inventory than the big chain groceries in town, but also an easier place to shop, as it never gets crowded. I've been to the Von's on Coast Village Road many times over the years--it's pretty convenient, after all, and impossible to miss if you spend any time in Montecito. By contrast, I'd never even seen this market until Matt B. suggested we go to pick up a few odd things we needed for the week.\n\nIt's a cute place with some comfortable neighborhood charm, and I enjoyed the ample parking and calm, quiet atmosphere. Obviously, the stock was more limited than at a supermarket--we couldn't find the pasta we wanted and did end up making a Von's run later in the week--but we picked up some of the items on our list, including a few bottles of wine. The wine selection was solid, with lots of local/regional wines. Definitely extensive enough that you'll walk away with what you need if you're not looking for anything too specific. (Our toddler, who was just learning his colors, pointed to a wall of reds and said, \"Red? Red?\") The cheese/deli section was pretty enticing, too.\n\nCheck-out was quick and easy and we went home with enough provisions to see us through dinner that night (mostly, we needed wine). I like Vons fine, but it's nice to have Montecito Village Grocery as a pleasant, less busy alternative."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-08-08 12:02:22", "review_text": "Bad service and expired products, its always hit or miss there, your better off going to Von's."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-09-10 15:53:32", "review_text": "This neighborhood grocery store has awesome European speciality items, not found elsewhere.  From the Deli to yogurt, olives, to plant-based products: it provides quality food at its finest.  We've become accustomed to settle for the adjacent and lower quality in our diets: not cool.  Treat yourself, this grocery store is Delectable."}]}
