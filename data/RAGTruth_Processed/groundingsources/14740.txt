They also had a great amount of outdoor seating. \n\nThe staff was great and really helpful. \n\nThe options for Hot Dogs was great! I wanted everything on the menu, but I do not have the stomach to do that. However, I do recommend the Taco Dog. Yes, it's everything a taco has on top of the hot dog (except for the tortillas of course). In theory, this does not sound all that appetizing, but believe me, it was/is perfectly executed. It does have spicy salsa, but not too crazy (I would say if you can't handle bare minimum spice, this is your warning, but if you can, please try it).\n\nI added a few more photos of the other Hot Dogs I ordered (which were good as well)."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-05 06:17:54", "review_text": "I gotta say I've been to a lot of gourmet hot dog joints and this made for the perfect Friday night in!

Favorites are the Chicago, Hawaiian, & Santa Barbara dogs. The deep fried Oreos are divine. Always get great service & consistently fantastic food. Check out Dave's - you'll be back for more!"}]}
