Came in the next day to return the defective toy. The guy working the counter said he didn't know how to process returns. He was clearly not alright and said he was stressed because the store was \"messed up\" and he just got back from Vegas. He was visibly shaking and his face was red around his eyes. I persisted asking for s return and he called the manager, who made me stand there for 25 mins while they tried to find a replacement, which they couldn't. After 25 mins they told me to drive another store and get a replacement. I am not from SB and didn't have time to drive to another store. They refused to refund me. If I had bought from Amazon this wouldn't have happened and it would have been cheaper. Now I know. Avoid this place."}]}
