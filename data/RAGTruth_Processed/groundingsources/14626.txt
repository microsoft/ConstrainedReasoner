Parking is difficult but folks are usually coming and going so we've always managed to score a spot. Check in with the hostess downstairs and if it's a typical beautiful day, try to get a table outside otherwise they also have indoor and bar seating too. My favorites are:\n- Cold combo app: Nice variety, perfect to share and savor\n- Clam chowder: Amazing!\n- Fish and chips: Large, freshly fried fish and plentiful fries\nThey also have cioppino here (a rare find) and a simple kids' menu but our kids and I dig the opportunity to eat seafood here\nAlso a great place to wander around after lunch since the beach is right there ... and when we were last there they had sand hills that look perfect for sand sledding!"}]}
