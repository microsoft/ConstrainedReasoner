I actually found a nice breakfast/ lunch place that served a decent amount of food that was made quality. Make sure if you order the French toast just another $3 bucks gets you a bunch off berries on top, delicious! Check my photos out and you'll see what I'm talking about! Also, we had a really good chai latte with oat milk. Definitely coming back here every morning when I'm stopping in SB!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-10 18:51:51", "review_text": "The outdoor dinning was cool with some music on.. so beach vibe.
