We brought our kids and they were pretty accommodating given that they didn't have a kids' menu.  The scrambles were pretty good, the cinnamon apple beignets were excellent.  The crab bloody Mary was a little watery but still spicy.  I could have rated this 5 stars but we've never spent $80 on a brunch so it's just 4 stars."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-01-27 18:12:42", "review_text": "This place has incredible breakfast.

It looks like Tupelo Junction has been shuttered for good. With no warning or messaging beyond some vague rumors that they forgot to renew their liquor license, it appears that it's gone.  Their website and listing here on Yelp still show it as active but the sign is down, the windows are covered in brown paper, and they don't answer the phone. R.I.P. Tupelo Junction.  Gonna miss that French toast!"}]}
