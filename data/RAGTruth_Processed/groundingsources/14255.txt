They're friendly in here and clean. I had a delicious veggie burrito and didn't feel at all sick afterwards. Appreciated the mix of veggies and no cilantro :) The chips weren't warm and were a bit crispy, but I LOVED their mild salsa -- I could eat a ton of this, but I don't even love salsa! Overall an A+++ Mexican experience."}]}
