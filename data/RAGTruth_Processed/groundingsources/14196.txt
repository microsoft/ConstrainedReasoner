I went for the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend with my husband, toddler, and in-laws, and it was a great spot for a casual lunch, where we could park freely and walk in with three generations of diners.\n\nThe place was busy but not overrun, and we got a corner table right away with booth seating and room for a high chair. The baby was immediately supplied with crayons and a kids' menu--his first time getting crayons at a restaurant, and he definitely made use of them. He also enjoyed looking around at all the other tables full of families, as well as the colorful surfboards on the walls. Both the atmosphere and the service were cheerful and welcoming.\n\nI was happy with my food, too. I ordered the chilaquiles rojos and added tri-tip, and this was a good, hearty meal. The chilaquiles were tortilla chips smothered with red sauce, topped with two eggs (I got mine over-easy) and served with guacamole, sour cream, feta cheese, and green onions. Solid, and while the tri-tip was nothing special, it did add some nice heft to my lunch (I do tend to want meat when it isn't there).\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to go to Mesa Cafe, but it's the kind of place I'll probably go back to because it's pleasant and convenient. I liked my chilaquiles, my son liked his crayons and grilled cheese. We all left pretty happy with the experience."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-19 23:22:07", "review_text": "First time at this cute little cafe and it was such a good experience! The food was great and our server Michael was so patient with our group as we had many order substitutions and requests! Definitely will be going back soon!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-01 18:31:11", "review_text": "The service was fine and when I asked for water without ice it arrived as desired. The special omelette with Rajas and caramelized onions somehow missed the caramelization memo and the Rajas were merely strips of chilies not peeled or cooked. I requested the potatoes be well done and they were barely cooked."}]}
