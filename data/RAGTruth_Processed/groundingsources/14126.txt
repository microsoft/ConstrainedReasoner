We waited about 20 minutes around 3:30pm but it didn't feel that long since the surrounding area of downtown SB is really nice. We requested outdoor dining and it was nice.\n\nThe service was great, our waiter was extremely polite and understanding. The food was good, overall. I ordered the baja chicken tacos which was nothing special and a bit bland. My family also ordered the prime rib cheesesteak which was okay and was a little too heavy on the bell peppers, a chipotle chicken sandwich which was really tasty, and the Finney burger with an impossible patty which was good too. So two dishes were underwhelming but two were good, so it evened out I'd say. Overall a decent place that's worth checking out!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 03:59:28", "review_text": "Had a really good bison burger here, cheese pizza for the kid as decent. French fries were way too salty and their ketchup tasted odd to me. Service was ok for a place full of 20 something year olds working. Definitely a younger crowd here, a good spot to grab some beers and watch some sports."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-14 03:57:00", "review_text": "Everything was so good! We forgot to take a picture of the Buffalo Cauliflower but trust me...it tasted as good as it looked! Peggy's chicken sandwich & the poke nachos we're equally good. Homemade chips  & truffle fries were amazing. Daughter added sausage to her Margherita Pizza & it  was good as well. I can't say enough good things about the food. Servings are large. Service was great as well. We will be back next time we are in SB!"}]}
