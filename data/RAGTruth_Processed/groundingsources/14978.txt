Count me in!!!!!\n\nThe last night of school this past semester my friends and I had a nice long party in downtown Santa Barbara. Once the bars were closed and we were thoroughly famished we decided to go to Billies. I had walked by it MANY times and it always smelt great but never took the time to go in.\n\nThe first thing to understand about going to Billies during the post-bar period is it's one of a select few restaurants that are open until very early so it will literally be swamped with people, most of whom are too drunk to put three sensical words together.\n\nThe night I was there there had been a scheduling error and they were understaffed. With a line out the door there was only one person working the counter and one cook. Watching this man work his heart out and still have a positive attitude I gained a real respect for him. If I were in his place I'd be hanging myself in the back room.\n\nWe finally got to order and I was told by multiple people that the Mac and Cheese is iconic.\n\nFood Tip: The Mac and Cheese is iconic.\n\nIt was priced decently and there are unlimited fountain drinks (which was fantastic) and while I was waiting for my order I geeked it up on the Star Trek pinball machine. Most of my friends were passed out in a booth and I was a light drinker that night so I had plenty of energy. \n\nOnce the food came I discovered that portions are not something they care about at Billies. It was a massive bowl of Mac and Cheese for just a couple of bucks. I enjoyed the food do a long while, then shared it with some friends. There was plenty to go around.\n\nBy the time we left it had calmed down a little. I thanked the man behind the counter for being so nice and working so hard and told him I would recommend Billies to everyone I know. That being said, here ya go everyone!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2010-12-13 23:25:14", "review_text": "I haven't tried any of the food, but my friend's friend works here and we decided to drop by, actually i always drop by whenever i'm in the sb area. this bar isn't as busy as the other bars, but i guess if you just want a good beer and watch tv it's a good place. my friend also told me that they open til 3 while all the others close at 2am. \n\ngood for happy hour!"}]}
