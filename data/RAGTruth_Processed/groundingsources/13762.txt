And getting noodles for takeout is the worst. But like a perfect storm, I found myself ordering pho to-go during the December 2020 COVID surge. Initially I thought it was going to be just \"edible\", and nothing more than that. Surprisingly, it was better than expected!\n\nMy order was packaged neatly, with the sauces in their respective containers and the broth kept separately. All the lids were snug and the bowl was wrapped in a separate plastic bag to ensure the contents did not spill out during travel. Everything was still super hot upon arrival, the rare beef slices cooked in the broth and I didn't need to reheat anything.\n\nTo the surprise of no one, the noodles did clump up a bit. It took some effort to separate the strands once they were submerged in the broth. But the consistency was great and it still had a chewy texture. The cuts of beef were tasty. I found the broth flavorful, but on the saltier side. Toppings are also minimal compared to dine in.\n\nCan't compare to pho restaurants in San Jose or Orange County, but it'll save you a trip up the 101 and you don't have to go through LA traffic. And for Santa Barbara standards, at least it's not Pho Bistro."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2022-01-02 20:41:40", "review_text": "Good food, but they never follow special requests on door dash.  Or even consistently include ingredients such as basil and cilantro with the chicken curry.  Eating there is okay because you can correct the kitchens mistakes, but I'd highly advise against ordering delivery from here."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 01:53:36", "review_text": "The spring rolls were exceptionally fresh and tasty. Turmeric soup was delish too. I'd opt for no raw onions next time but amazing."}]}
