A 7-month pregnant woman didn't show up for her 2019 doctor's appointment and disappeared in Florida
Florida Mystery: The Unexplained Disappearance of Pregnant Jasmine Robinson.
In the small town of Archer, Florida, Jasmine Robinson led a life full of promise and joy. Brought up by her grandmother and deeply bonded with her aunt and elder sister, Shantavia, Jasmine had a radiant personality. Her prowess on the basketball court during her high school years earned her the nickname “Beezy,” which stuck even into her adult life. A church choir singer with an infectious sense of humor, she was a beacon of happiness to those around her.
2018 brought a new chapter to Jasmine's life when she learned she was expecting a baby. Eagerly looking forward to motherhood, she had chosen the name "Jamillia" for her soon-to-be-born daughter. However, fate had different plans, and in a twist of events, Jasmine mysteriously disappeared in 2019, while she was seven months into her pregnancy.
On the evening of February 18, 2019, after being dropped home by her grandmother, Jasmine was alone. It's unclear where her grandmother headed, but something had perturbed Jasmine that day, though she refrained from discussing it with anyone. Later that night, during a seemingly routine phone call with her aunt, Jasmine gave no hint of any distress. They made plans for her prenatal checkup the next day.
However, when the time came, Jasmine was nowhere to be found. Calls to her went unanswered, and it soon became evident that something was amiss. Growing increasingly anxious, her family reported her missing on February 20th.
Disturbingly, in the days leading up to her disappearance, Jasmine had confided in her sister Shantavia about unwelcome attention she was receiving from her unborn child's father. His insistent calls at her workplace and on her personal phone were unsettling to Jasmine. He didn’t seem supportive of the pregnancy, but Jasmine was determined to embrace motherhood, regardless of his views.
The police investigation hinted at Jasmine not being alone when she last left her grandmother’s home. Indications suggest that her departure wasn't of her own volition. Adding to the mystery, all her personal belongings, including essentials like her purse, remained untouched at her home. While authorities have questioned several individuals, it remains unknown if the baby's father has been cleared of suspicion.
The quest to uncover the truth about Jasmine Robinson and her unborn child remains ongoing. Today, were she with us, Jasmine would be celebrating her 27th birthday.
