Fortunately they have a private parking lot (rare for a business in IV), making it easy to come back."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2018-06-18 03:50:36", "review_text": "Still can't believe Gio's is gone but Rincon is a satisfactory replacement. Most of their beer pitches are $17.99 which is kinda pricey, especially when the IV pale ale is good and only $9.99! I like how they are prepared for customers to play games with plastic cups + ping pong balls available! We brought die and played games at a table which was easy as the place was pretty empty on a Saturday afternoon. They don't wristband like Gio's used to."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-05-19 20:05:13", "review_text": "Beer tastes great. Massive upgrade to Giovannis. Coming from an old Gaucho who hates a lot of the Isla Vista changes. This is a good one though."}]}
