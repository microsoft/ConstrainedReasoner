It was the best tasting experience we have ever had! The service was unparalleled and the wine was absolutely delicious. (The gentleman that helped us was wearing a super cool hummingbird shirt.... Thanks for the tasting!)\n\nI would highly recommend that if you ever find yourself in SB, you make it a point to stop by! I know we will when we make it back! Thanks for giving us one of our favorite memories of the weekend!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-07-18 00:10:26", "review_text": "Wow, such a fan! Came here for special event that included a tasting. I really love the Italian varietals offered which is kind of rare for this area since most of the wineries produce Rh\u00f4ne varietals. The winemaker himself shared details about the production of the wine which made it really interactive. I really like whites but they are all really enjoyable. My favorite white was the Pinot Grigio. \n\nEven as a local of four years, I had never visited any of the businesses in Arcada Plaza. I found out that many businesses there have a deal where they waive the corkage fee if you bring in a bottle from August Ridge, super great info! I would highly recommend this tasting room to friends who want to try out different varietals!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-06-13 02:50:49", "review_text": "Looking forward to coming here soon"}]}
