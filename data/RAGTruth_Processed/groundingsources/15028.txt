My drink was withheld. I was held up in the morning by an employee. She wasn't friendly or accommodating. It wasn't as if I was patronizing their business. I was essentially scolded with no respect for my time or the fact that I purchase things here often. This isn't the first time. We were treated rudely about refills on more than one occasion with the staff demanding a receipt (even when they never gave us one). I don't need the third degree or rude treatment when I'm overpaying for coffee on a Monday morning. I suggest going to the State Street location where the staff is always friendly, accommodating, and wonderful."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-01-06 01:40:12", "review_text": "Nice shaded location (near TJ's) and there is almost always a parking space. One of the few coffee shops around town that has power outlets. Solid coffee. Decent Jasmine and Dragonwell green tea. $1.00 refill for coffee. The service is great for the most part - it seems like quite a few people work here. However, the employee this morning left a bad taste in my mouth. She didn't say anything specifically unkind, but I got the feeling my presence was a burden to her. Maybe she is in pain and doesn't have much kindness to give. I've worked many years in retail - and I know workers aren't robots and have complex inner lives - but even at my worst I could fake it, or at least not be a grouch to my customers. I left feeling a bit resentful (or hurt) that a stranger would be so rigid and unkind to me. I don't deserve that! I'll get over it though haha. For prospective customers: the organic light roast (Peru) was infinitely better than the dark roast, which I had for refill. Four stars because of the location, affordability, power outlets, and most of the customer service. I couldn't go full 5 stars because, frankly, it's 2020 and you can find tastier, more complex, higher-quality coffee elsewhere."}]}
