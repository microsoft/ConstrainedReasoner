{"question": "how to cook in oven a prime beef roast", "passages": "passage 1:Remove prime rib from refrigerator and allow the meat to come to room temperature, about 3 hours depending on the size of the roast. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil. Unwrap the roast and place onto roasting pan; blot with paper towels. Sift together flour, pepper, salt, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and celery seed into a small bowl. Coat the roast all over with the flour mixture. Roast in preheated oven until cooked to your desired degree of doneness; about 4 1/2 hours (20 minutes a pound) for medium-rare.\n\npassage 2:To check the temperature of your oven, place an oven thermometer on the center rack and heat the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees F. If, after 15 minutes, the oven temperature reads higher or lower than your oven setting, adjust your oven setting for your prime rib baking and for all your future baking.\n\npassage 3:Place the tray in the oven and roast for 1/2 hour. For the first half hour, the beef will cook at a higher temperature, which will give the outside of the beef a good sear. Make sure you remember to come back to the oven after 1/2 hour. Turn down the temperature to 225\u00b0F (107\u00b0C) and continue roasting.\n\n"}
