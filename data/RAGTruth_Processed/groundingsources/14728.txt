That is only relevant to this review in the fact that their pizza is out of this world, and I can vouch for that..  by experience.

I placed a fairly complicated order for 2 pizzas online and went in to pick it up.  The guy at the register said \"I'm sorry dude, but we messed up one of your pizzas so we had to remake it - but you can have all of them.\"  The only thing wrong was they accidentally put red onions on one of them and I had requested them removed.  So I ended up with 3 delicious pizzas instead of 2 without even asking for it.  That's amazing customer service.  The pizzas were all fantastic, per usual.  I left super happy and fed a small army.  Can't recommend them enough!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-13 23:43:06", "review_text": "Great college town pizza place, although a bit on the pricier side! I always order the Grateful Veg and substitute the cheese for the \"Daiya Vegan Cheese\"  So good.\n4/5 for taste  \n3/5 stars for price $$$"}]}
