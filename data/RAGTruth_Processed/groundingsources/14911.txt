The food had a great taste and was different to most Indian restaurants out there.  The only thing I would recommend is to have some kid friendly options."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2013-06-10 04:55:48", "review_text": "For the price, a definite NO WAY!  Sat on a nice patio and the service was fine considering we were the only people eating there.  Ordered the lamb samosa to start.  It was dry, small, and had no redeeming flavor whatsoever.  The mint sauce was the only thing that made it taste passable.  For entrees we choose to stay safe with chicken tikka masala with rosemary garlic naan to accompany.  I went to use the restroom while we waited for dinner.  In the kitchen I saw an entire plastic trash can filled with empty plastic pouches soiled with sauces and such.  Made me think that nothing is fresh made on site.  Food tasted like mall food-court food, which isn't necessarily bad except we paid more here than we did at Roy for fresh homemade seafood fettuccine.  We will not be back."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-05-05 00:19:46", "review_text": "Spice Avenue is a great place to go for lunch. They have a really good lunch buffet special for $12. The naan is delicious and really fresh! The service is also very friendly. Try there Saag Paneer/Tofu with the naan"}]}
