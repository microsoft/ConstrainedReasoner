We heard music & saw it was somewhat empty. We thought ok, cool. I like when its not too busy, so I can get quick service. All the bartenders were nice. I didn't get his name, but he helped us & served us quick, very knowledgable about drinks. Seemed like the DJ was setting up for the night.. I enjoyed his mixes, kept me thinking what song was coming on next. They had a projection on the wall playing videos. Which I like when at a bar. But it was playing on the wall, not on a projection screen, but the actual wall.\n\nAnyway, we were enjoying ourselves w/ the music & the vibe. Until, it started to get busy.  We were sitting at the bar while there were people standing behind us. Well that group of people just got there, had drinks in their hand & Idk if they were arguing w/ each other or just plain sloppy, but one of them either threw or dropped their glass of beer. Beer & broken glass pieces all over the floor. Someone came, swept & cleaned everything up. Then everyone went back to their business... So a song that I like came on & I decided I wanted to get up to dance. As soon as I stood up I hear a \"crack\"! Apparently there was a piece glass on the floor next me. As soon as I got down from the bar seat & stepped on the ground the piece of glass pierced the bottom of my foot. Ouch!! Man! That freakin hurt. All I saw on my foot was blood. I was bleeding & asking the bartender for napkins to stop the blood. I had to tell the bartender/worker what happened. They just ask if I was ok. I said no, but I'll be ok. I think he was asking if I wanted drink, I just asked for a band aid. Then when I felt able to walk we left. That really ruined my night in SB & totally killed our buzz. \n\nDon't know if I'll return, but if I do, I hope nothing like that happens again."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2015-11-02 02:18:03", "review_text": "Made the mistake of going Halloween night thinking it would be fun but the bartenders ignored us for 20+ minutes. After an order mix up one of the bartenders called me and my friends idiots- he was so incredibly rude. Makes me not really want to go there again. Go somewhere else!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2015-10-12 02:08:59", "review_text": "Bar sucks for singles. The bar tinder is kind of a dick. They treat singles like trash.
