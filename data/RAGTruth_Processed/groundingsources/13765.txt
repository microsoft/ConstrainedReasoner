That all changed today! Tepeyac in downtown Santa Barbara is the place to go for Taquitos. I had the Surtido #1 a.k.a. \"The Original\". You get one of each of the Taquitos (six total) with lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and guacamole. The food was great, the owners were fun to talk with and real down to earth. The price was just under $10 for the Taquitos and a drink."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2011-07-15 17:08:08", "review_text": "A great experience- I'm always on the hunt for a good potato taquito and was suuuuuper excited to try these ones. To my delight there were two other vegetarian choices - Rasa (sp? - it's the chili one) and beans. They were each delicious in their own right and complimented each other. There was a red sauce and a green sauce on the table-  green was nice and spicy. The red was kinda boring but I know people who like that kind of thing-  something for everyone!\n\nOwners are super friendly, atmosphere is very casual and comfortable, food is tasty! I'll be back!\n\n\n*************************************\n\nI guess I started this review months ago and never finished it... Not going to bother now as they are CLOSED!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2011-05-04 16:40:22", "review_text": "Wandering home last night and hungry, I spied the open door, and thought, why not!\n\nAnd, indeed, I was richly rewarded.  As it was my first time, I got the #1 with all 6 taquitos.  I agree, the chicken was a bit dry and not my fav, the rest were pretty good.  In fact, the rajas, ground beef, and bean verged on greatness. \n\nI'd definitely go again, and am curious to watch their expanding menu."}]}
