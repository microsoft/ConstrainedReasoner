It's small. It's hidden. And it has everything you need for herbs, teas, coffees, cards and other local gifts. There are a couple tables out front, and a few in the back, if you'd like to enjoy your beverage at the store. Vices&Spices is a true Local favorite located on upper State Street with a hidden parking lot in the back. I found Vices and spices in 2002 and sooooo pleased the shop is still rocking it! I come to Vices & Spices for their coffee beans and fun conversation with staff members. They have a coffee club, so if you buy six pounds of coffee you get one for free. My favorite so far is their Linda's blend, comprised of three dark roast coffee beans. They have some specialty coffees available at certain times of year, in particular a 100%Kona coffee from the owner's plantation (I think)  in Hawaii. I am a dark or medium roast person, though, so I have tried mostly the dark roasts like the Magic blend. My favorite is still Linda's.  If you purchase a few pounds and intend on saving the coffee beans (which I do because I never want to run out of coffee), they offer to specially wrap the beans in plastic to protect them. All staff members are knowledgeable and provide excellent guidance on NOT freezing beans. I find the coffee beans to be of excellent quality. I also like supporting local businesses. While they do sell some baked goods, there aren't too many options. I come here for supplies, not typically to sit for a cuppa. I typically see more locals here then students. Definitely a great place for coffee bean and loose leaf tea needs."}]}
