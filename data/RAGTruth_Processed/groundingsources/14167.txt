I remember when this place was a chain and they had a restaurant in Cerritos, where I grew up. I never got to go to the Santa Barbara location, although coincidentally, I saw it many times as I drove up the 101 to go to school at UCSB back in the 90s. As someone had mentioned among the comments, it did have a grandparents' home feeling to it. As a kid, I vaguely remember being weighed on the scale to determine the cost of my meal. I was sad when the Cerritos location had closed and now I am saddened to hear that this last restaurant is no longer. End of an era."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-09-01 23:58:43", "review_text": "I love the Big Yellow House restaurant in Summerland, Ca. Why they would close it down is beyond me. So many wonderful meals of enjoying the scenic ocean view, old world charm, and dining on delicious pot roast, chicken, mashed potatoes etc. was such a pleasure while visiting Santa Barbara.  When I sat in the front dining room feeling the sun and breeze on my face I felt such a wonderful feeling of complete contentment. The country meals were an absolute taste treat. Thank you Big Yellow House Restaurant for such wonderful memories."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-02-04 17:59:14", "review_text": "Generally speaking, the early years of this BYH chain had one of the most unique, creative and simple restaurant concepts of all time. \n\nNo lengthy overprice menu to look over:  just a \"dinner is served, wipe the mud off your shoes, pass the gravy, and come an get it\"  type of concept. As Mom or Grandma would do every night! (when families ACTUALLY SAT DOWN for dinner!) The food was flavorful, freshly made and taught me to love my vegetables at a early age! Generous portions and  was \"all you can eat\" too. Plus it was 3 courses included for one low price...geez,  who does that?? No one.\n\nCan't forget either, they had very BEST cornbread!! The gal comes around many times with piping hot CB in her basket. Served w honey butter...yummy!\n\nOh, I think I saw a Facebook page for what looked like restaurant employees for all their locations, if anyone is interested. Pictures and posts and such.\n\nMiss you Big Yellow House!!"}]}
