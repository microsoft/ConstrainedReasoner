However, when it arrives quite low in the class, it is not only a disappointment, but also a rip off.  Drink arrived less than half full.  Waitress was a bit haughty, so I didn't want to deal with bringing it to her attention."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-30 07:37:08", "review_text": "As a local I have loved Al's Alcazar and Milk & Honey since the beginning of time. Lamborghini Sliders are a must, Pork and Shrimp Tacos always. Menu has changed slightly over the years however, \"Date with a Pig\", salty sweetness is yum yum deliciousness always and forever. Shrimp and Grits and The Heat of Passion are all must have go too's. Sit in Nicole's section, she is heaven sent and her lighthearted sweet personality will make your week right!"}]}
