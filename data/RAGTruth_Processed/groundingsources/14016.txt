Wasn't able to try any of the tapas because their fryer was broken but I got the chicken teriyaki and honey bbq pork rice bowls with cloudy jasmine milk tea and Hokkaido milk tea with cheese foam. The chicken teriyaki was super dry even though it was dark meat and the honey bbq pork was super fatty with not much flavor. The rice was mushy and gross, you can tell a lot about how good an Asian restaurant is by how good their rice is. And in this case, both the entree and the rice was awful. However, if you're just going for drinks, it's not bad! But I won't be returning especially since Kaiju is MUCH better."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-25 01:21:52", "review_text": "Love love love Mojo!

I always get the jasmine milk tea which is good the boba is only ok, but the wonder Is in the chicken dear god it had me seeing colors like in ratatouille."}]}
