This place is insanely expensive for the food you get. $16 for 2 scoops of protein is an actual for poke, but sadly there really aren't many other options to go to. Better off driving to LA for poke then paying and arm and a leg for sub par food."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-21 22:02:08", "review_text": "Amazing service, friendly owners!  We get poke every Friday, they remember our order and are happy to see us!  The new location is clean, and we get the same amazing service as the Goleta location."}]}
