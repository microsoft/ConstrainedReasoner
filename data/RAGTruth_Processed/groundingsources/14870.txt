Have been there twice and ordered different burgers and shared with my partner, and they were all good. The reason I would have given a 4.5 is that  we ordered a chocolate milkshake that tasted like mocha. Not sure if they messed up (which should have been pretty hard to do since there were only 2 other people in there) or their chocolate just tastes funky...Overall, however, I will absolutely go back for the burgers. Reasonably priced, as well. Yum, Yum."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2011-09-21 03:59:29", "review_text": "When it opened a few months ago, I was a happy and satisfied customer of Flaming Grill, especially their boba that was tastier and cheaper than Naan Stop.\n\nHowever, now that I came back for a quick visit, I purchased a taro milk tea with boba and I was disappointed. It was warm and flavorless with a barely-mixed texture. The boba was too squishy and I just pretty much wasted $3 :(\n\nNot planning to come back, especially now the new business is called Fat Mo's Burgers and Car Wash. I really don't get  the whole car wash theme :/"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2011-08-29 18:54:48", "review_text": "So I go on Yelp looking for Boba/Milk tea places and figure this one is worth a shot....haha, ya right.\n\nI walk in, spend about 4 mins standing there before I'm even acknowledged (I was the only person in the store). After I'm greeted, I stated that I wanted a peach milk tea with pineapple jelly. The mexican guy behind the counter then asks if I wanted boba too....I've never been asked if I want tapioca with my jelly in probably 500+ milk teas in my life...its usually one or the other. But what do you expect from a mexican guy at a  middle eastern food place selling milk teas. Identity crisis much? \n\nIn any case, then he goes to ring me up, and I kid you not it takes about 4 mins, complete awkward silence and all. The whole time the guy is bumbling around on the computer. He then repeats my order wrong to me, asking if I want lychee jelly. I said no, the pineapple I asked for is fine. He said that they do not have pineapple jelly...I point at the menu and say that it says they do. He responds that they do not. Ok...well then mango is fine. The total is 4.08 and I hand over a 5, he asks if I have 8 cents, I said, I do, but its in my car and I can go get it. He then proceeds to give me the 92 cents in change like he didn't even hear me!! At this point I'm starting to think this guy is on drugs.\n\nAll service issues aside, the milk tea was sub par and the guy put like 4 ice cube in it that immediately melted and he also put a combination of mango jelly and mango pudding in the tea too. I don't think he had ANY clue what he was doing at all. Good thing I didn't order food."}]}
