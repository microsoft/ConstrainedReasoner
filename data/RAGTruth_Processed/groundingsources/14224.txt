For some time I had heard wonderful things about this catering and meal delivery company, so I was looking forward to experiencing it for myself. I had the pleasure of meeting both Chef Cristina Gonzalez (\"back of the house\") and her life and business partner, Elsa Cisneros (\"front of the house\"). Together as one they run this sustainable, local and organic-focused business. \n\nTo begin, both women are extremely talented and experienced. Chef Cristina attended the School of Culinary Arts at SBCC and then later worked under Wolfgang Puck and for Bon Appetit. On the other hand, Elsa focused on catering at Philip's College in San Antonio, later to find herself at Bon Appetit elbow-to-elbow with Cristina. \n\nNext, viewing the exterior of where Daily Greenz shared kitchen is located is unassuming. However, after entering you quickly realize that this is home to one of Santa Barbara's cleanest kitchens. Everything from the ovens to the pans were sparkling clean and new.\n\nDaily Greenz Pop-Up allowed me the opportunity to taste a few items. To begin, there was a refreshing Jamaica \"Blood\" Tea (for Halloween) and a perfectly-balanced Margarita. They provided a fresh Caesar Salad as a starter, followed by a choice of two tacos. The tacos included Achiote Chicken (refried beans, caramelized onion, cheese, and avocado-tomatillo drizzle) and Pork Chile Colorado (Pork Palace Heritage Pasture pork, refried beans, and queso fresco). Both tacos were small and bite size, yet huge and full of delicious flavors. Each ingredient could be tasted individually and enjoyed immensely.\n\nI learned and appreciate that Daily Greenz gives you the option to reserve your chef-created meal service between 48 hours to 2 weeks in advance. Not only that, they allow you to choose a flexible meal plan for lunches/dinners (either or both) for one to every day of the week. Bottom line: If you are seeking a meal delivery service for your family, or a caterer for your business, please contact and give Daily Greenz a try."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-08-21 16:25:15", "review_text": "Amazing experience!!!
