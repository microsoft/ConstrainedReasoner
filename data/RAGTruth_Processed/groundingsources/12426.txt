CPR stands for 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation' and is a life-saving procedure used to help dogs that have stopped breathing and/or have no heartbeat.. Remove anything blocking the dog's airway. If the dog has a heartbeat, you'll want to concentrate on breathing for the dog. Before beginning, remove any blockages from the dog\u2019s mouth, including any vomit, blood, mucus, or foreign material.\n\npassage 2:1 If the breaths go in easily, continue on to B-Breathing. 2  If the breaths do not go in, or if you detect some resistance, reposition her neck and try the two breaths again. 3  If these breaths do not go in, inspect the airway by looking into your dog's mouth. 4  Look down her throat for a foreign object blocking the airway.
