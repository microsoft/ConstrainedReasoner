I ordered a tri-tip sandwich from here. The sandwich came with a half-foot French bread with red onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and tri-tip with mayo. It was mostly bread and there was barely anything in the sandwich. Overall, it tasted okay and the service is quick."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-15 20:50:43", "review_text": "Just randomly saw this place on Yelp today and had to go try it as I'm Asian so I'm always on the lookout for new Asian places to try because I need my Asian food fix from time to time -- it's a special diet I have :P\n\nI was a little skeptical based on their seemingly random array of food selections but I went for it anyways despite my husband saying he wasn't impressed with a sandwich he got there once.\n\nTo my delight, this place was totally awesome! It's a cute little deli in an industrial area so they get a lot of foot traffic during lunchtime from all the workers nearby. There's indoor and outdoor seating and the cute Asian couple that owns it are so nice and sweet. \n\nI got the lunch combo with chicken teriyaki and California roll -- it comes with miso soup, rice, salad and 2 egg rolls. The miso soup was authentic and delicious, the teriyaki chicken was sweet/savory and grilled to perfection with bits of charred ends, the egg rolls were hot and crispy, the California roll was fresh and moist, and the salad was tossed with a tasty sesame ginger dressing. In terms of flavor, it's honestly on par with a lot of real Japanese restaurant bento lunches. \n\nIt was also a lot of food for under $15! I couldn't finish it all so I'll also have leftovers to eat for dinner tonight. I have yet to try the other menu items but I'll be sure to come back again soon!"}]}
