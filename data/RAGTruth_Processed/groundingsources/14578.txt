It's uniquely situated within the confines of this building, in what looks to be a converted storage container. Pretty cool. \n\nRegardless of day or time, there is usually a line for The Nook. I see it as a testament to their quality. Each time I've ordered from here, the food is just that. They make a great ahi sandwich and their pretzel bun burger is delicious. The pricing isn't cheap, items start at around $14, but I'd say that the cost is on par with the competition. You certainly get a good bang for your buck. \n\nYou don't necessarily have to patronize one of the taprooms to order food from here - simply just walk in and get in line. Worth it!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-17 04:53:36", "review_text": "I love coming to Lama for a beer and getting a turkey burger from the Nook! I've had a bunch of things on their menu but I think the fried chicken sandwich and the turkey burger are my favorite. If you're not hungry for a full meal, their truffle fries are also a great snack to go with your beer. I highly recommend coming here for dinner, a beer, and watching a game or just hanging with friends!"}]}
