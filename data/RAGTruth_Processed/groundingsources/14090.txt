One who appreciates tasty-good food simply cannot stay away very long. My tri tip was delicious, and the multiple traditional sides were exactly on-point. (Prices are friendly too.)\n\nI used to visit this establishment weekly to take part in great African drumming classes, and it's fun to revisit the festive atmosphere and food. They present their cuisine and culture with hospitality, nuance and great cooking skills.\n\n#HighlyRecommended"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-18 05:28:16", "review_text": "my boyfriend and I went here for dinner and it was a nice experience :) we each got a caipirinha to drink which was good and my boyfriend LOVED the stroganoff! My Brazilian cesar was good and the brigadiero which we got to go was AMAZING! I would go back to try more! The lady told us to make ourselves at home which was a sweet sentiment!! The people were very nice :,)"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-15 12:06:28", "review_text": "The restaurant facility itself may not look all that elegant and appealing but the service and the food really blows that away. They serve food for each meal of the day but I personally would recommend going for breakfast and trying one of their acai fruit bowls. Slightly on the pricier side but so worth it and you will be healthily full for hours to come! The culture here is also something that is unique and interesting. Great place for family brunch!"}]}
