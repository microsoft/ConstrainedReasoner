I've been eating Rusty's since I was a kid and so whenever I'm back in SB it is a given that I go with my kids. I love watching them play the old school arcade games that I remember as a kid. The pizza is tasty and I love the lunch special. Salad and a personal pizza. Affordable and satisfying. The environment is probably pretty dry for those without childhood memories but order a glass of wine (or bottle) and you'll start feeling the old school SB vibe."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-03-01 08:08:18", "review_text": "Food is ok, not the best. But it's like the employees don't know how to talk to customers. The delivery man was nice though, hope my tip actually went to him."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-02-12 21:15:16", "review_text": "I wish I could give zero stars. This is the worst experience I have had at a rustys in very long. I think that their pizza is GREAT but the attitude from almost every single employee is not. It makes me want to steer clear at all times. Also, they assumes my friends gender and banned her from the store for going in the girls bathroom by a short woman with glasses. Absolutely DISGUSTING, the staff should be ashamed of themselves."}]}
