I thought this place just opened but I guess theyve been open for several months. I was with my dog and wanted some take out. the jostess was very helpful at answering my questions and bringing everything out to me since I couldnt come in with my dog. my order was ready in less than 10 minutes which was nice. as far as the food....MEH. I got the two item combo which came with a choice of side and choice of garlic or cornbread.  I chose the garlic bread, which was a mistake. the taste was nice but it was rock hard. garlic bread should be soft and fluffy not hard, it didnt feel fresh. I chose mac and cheese for my side and really like it, it was my favorite part of the meal and a large portion. for the items I got the baby back ribs and tri tip. I had one rib with the sweet mollassas sauce. the sauce was not sweet and the hostess described and was spicy, which I specifically told her I did not want. the taste was still okay and would have been fine, but the ribs were hard to get off the bone. all the ribs ive ever had melt off the bone, this meat was very overcooked. next was the trip tip, I was pretty happy with that. the tri tip was pretty tender and not overcooked. after one piece of tritip I was too full to eat anymore. overall, it is a great deal for the amount of food they gave you, $11 and I'll make two full meals out of it. I would go back again but I would not order the ribs or garlic bread."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2014-05-03 01:35:50", "review_text": "this restaurant has gone out of business.\n\nhttp://www.santabarbara.com/dining/news/\n\nSMOKE N BARREL CLOSES\nWednesday, April 30, 2014\nReaders \"Mister P\" and \"Black CA Guy\" tell me that Smoke N Barrel BBQ Shack at 6920 Marketplace Drive in Goleta has closed after 7 months in business.

The service was very good. Our waitress was on point the entire nice. However, the food was not. I ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs with Mac n cheese and garlic bread. The ribs were meaty but a bit cold. Moreover, they tasted like those precooked ribs they sell that Von's. No flavor and bland. The Mac n cheese also was bland and the garlic bread was cold. How hard is it to make fresh garlic bread to order? Don't let curiosity get the best of you, stick with Hollister Brew Co."}]}
