Given the extremely large menu, it was difficult to pick which items to try but alas these were the chosen ones. Really like everything in the beef noodle soup except the beef; the broth was flavorful and had a mild kick of spice. It was very refreshing with the classic pairing with some poached veggies. The noodles were well made as well, and was springy and soft at the same time. The beef, however, was tough and chewy.\n\nThe pork bun was suboptimal, it was salty, oily, and hard to eat. However, the fact that the bun was seared was interesting. Needs some much needed pickled vegetable in the dish."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-09 06:10:47", "review_text": "I had the spicy squid. I'm a pretty white guy but I like spice, so I was expecting something with maybe some spicy Mayo or whatever, a few pieces of squid, and some rice. I had a date to go on with this new guy so I wanted something that could be a fun talking point. \n\nIt was a talking point alright. \n\nFive seconds in and it's the spiciest thing I've ever eaten. My entire face burns with the intensity of crunching red-hot coals in the pits of hell. A few minutes in and my tongue goes completely numb. My lips tingle so much they're practically vibrating. My entire body is screaming for help but I dont stop eating this amazing squid. It was fresh, done to perfection, and a good ratio of meat to vegetables. \n\nNow this guy is being pretty nice about offering me water and whatnot, but I have never looked more unattractive. Snot is drizzling down my face. I'm practically crying. But it's so good I dont stop eating (plus it was kinda expensive and I didnt want to waste it). We're both laughing over this food and I'm trying to offer him some but he's vegetarian. He'll never know how spicy that was, or how good the meal tasted to make me keep eating it even though I was dying. We did not have a second date. Probably because he thinks I'm some sort of culinary masochist. I guess I kind of am."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-10-22 03:19:58", "review_text": "If you are looking for average food that takes forever, messed up dishes and wrong order, and waitresses that ignore you and treat you like an enemy, you got it! No a 'sorry' after missing one dish from our order and keep us waiting for 40 minutes, no Answer until called very loudly, and cursing on us after check out in Chinese. She said something like fucking idiot, can't imagine how such a women full of hatred and zero gratitude can work in a service industry. Would never go again. I mean, one of the drawbacks, bad luck for us, all of these drawbacks? I wonder how this place operates."}]}
