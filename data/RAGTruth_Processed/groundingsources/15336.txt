{"question": "how does a mass air flow sensor work", "passages": "passage 1:What Does a Mass Air flow Sensor Do? Your mass air flow sensor or \u201cMAF\u201d detects the volume of air as it enters your engine by heating up a thin wire or resistor. The computer in your car then measures electrical resistance through the MAF as the air flowing through the sensor cools its components down. With a firm understanding of how much air is flowing into your engine, the computer can then direct fuel injectors to add more or less gasoline to the air/fuel mixture.\n\npassage 2:How do you replace a mass air flow sensor? There are different ways to replace mass air flow sensors (a.k.a. airflow sensors and mass airflow sensors). In this video, our master technician shows you how to replace a full housing-style mass air flow sensor on a 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix. For more videos on mass air flow sensors, view our YouTube Playlist.\n\npassage 3:- All maf sensors include an electrical connector which is used to transfer data to the computer. Mass Air Flow Electrical Connector. Step 3 - A hot wire is used to detect air flow by measuring the resistance change as varying amounts of air are passed over it. Mass Air Flow Hot Wire.\n\n"}
