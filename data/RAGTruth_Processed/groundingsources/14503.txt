We stopped here for a quick lunch and it didn't disappoint! Lots of fresh fruit available ans a great variety of toppings. A\u00e7a\u00ed was a bit thinner than other types I've had but still had great flavor. The chai pudding topping was my favorite - never had that before and it was a nice addition! Would stop by again for sure!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-19 00:38:41", "review_text": "Love this place for a quick lunch or a pick me up! There are plenty of choices for toppings and they have gluten free options. I like adding coconut, peanut butter, bananas, strawberries and granola. My reasoning for the four stars is i feel it is a little overpriced."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-19 03:30:05", "review_text": "5 star acai bowl, service, and location.  So impressed with this last minute find.  It ended up being a light dinner kinda night for us and with not much open at almost 8pm, but these bowls hit the spot.  \n\nOnce you choose the size you want, there is a large list of toppings which are unlimited.  I chose everything that sounded good and I was so impressed with how well they all went together.  My first time having peanut butter with my acai and chai pudding but it messed well.  Fresh, flavorful and filling.  \n\nI know where to stop now when in Santa Barbara."}]}
