Aksum is a great option for Ethiopian food in Santa Barbara. The staff was super friendly and the food was delicious. We tried the vegetable combo and meat combo since it was our first time here and we wanted to try some things. It was all delicious and I would probably roll with one or two of the combos next time around as well. Injera was on point and overall we had a great lunch. Thanks Aksum!!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-07 19:08:02", "review_text": "A friend an I were excited to try this place. I recently moved from San Diego to SB, and was really hoping to find some great Ethiopian food. We got the veggie combo, and it was honestly amazing. The service was outstanding!! We were there for my birthday, and they made me feel as home as I've felt in SB. Highly recommend."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-18 23:06:49", "review_text": "Went here for  lunch today. Wasn't Planning on stopping here but people's plates looked amazing. So glad we did. I have always heard Ethiopian food was amazing so I was excited to try it and so glad I did. Got the meat platter and shared with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed it. I will be back. Bummer they're only open for lunch. They share the location with the carribean restaurant too."}]}
