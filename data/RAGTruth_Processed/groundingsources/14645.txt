It has since closed down, but the chef does pop ups and perhaps has plans to reopen in the future - if she does, we'll soon be regulars again. All of her food is wonderful, super healthy, filling, satisfying, full of deliciousness. We constantly rave about Honey B, and her cookbook has a lot of the recipes from that restaurant. \n\nCheck out her website to see what she's up to now: https://www.thehoneybkitchen.com"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-10-07 10:02:41", "review_text": "We walked around disoriented and didn't find the cafe.

So many delicious VEGAN options! The prices are very fair, especially when compared to SB pricing. They even have vegan soft serve. The dillies and mighty bowl are my favorites, but I know I can keep returning for other amazing vegan options. Plus, the rooftop is an amazing place to eat."}]}
