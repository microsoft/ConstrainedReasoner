{"question": "what is the difference between gas and oil?", "passages": "passage 1:While the price of natural gas has remained relatively stable in the last few years, oil prices have been high and rising thanks in large part to continued unrest in Middle Eastern oil producing countries. Just two years ago the average winter home oil heating bill was $1,752.\n\npassage 2:2.Oil is found only in the ground, whereas gas can also be produced by decaying organic matter. 3.Oil and gas are both used for heating, transportation, and electricity generation, but in slightly different ways. 4.Gas is better overall for the environment than oil, especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\npassage 3:Fact: Heating oil systems have a longer life. The average life expectancy of an oil heat appliance is 30 or more years if they are properly maintained. The average life expectancy of a natural gas furnace is only 11-14 years. And, the efficiency ratings of new heating oil systems range from 83% to 95%.\n\n"}
