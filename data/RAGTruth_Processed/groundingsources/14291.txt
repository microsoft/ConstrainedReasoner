What??  Guess I'll have to find a new place in SB to grub!\nWhen I visited last, Marina took our order of Grilled Mahi taco, Pastor taco, Sea bass taco and a Cucumber lime drink.  She was very outgoing and friendly.  \nAll salsas are full of flavor and delicious, we couldn't decide which was our favorite!  Sad to see this place gone...  :("}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-12-07 05:27:39", "review_text": "The tacos here are very good, although a bit on the pricey side.  The main problem with this place is that they aren't reliably open when they say they will be.\n\nI've been here three or four times now.  They have a lineup of seemingly ordinary taco styles like carnitas, barbacoa, and al pastor, but the execution is anything but ordinary.  The al pastor and barbacoa are unusually succulent and delicious.  On top of these, they have fish tacos that set a high bar for other taquerias to meet.  They also set a high bar for your wallet to meet, though: their signature \"mango pescado\" taco will set you back $6.  (Admittedly, it's a bit larger than an ordinary taco, and according to the guy they use locally-caught fish, which is cool.)  The salsa lineup doesn't disappoint either.\n\nThe place is tiny, so seating is ultra-minimal: a small counter inside and two tiny tables just outside the door.  You eat off plates displaying the likeness of Jesus Christ, the virgin Mary, or the like.  Cash only.\n\nThis would be a go-to place in my taco rotation but for one fatal flaw: they don't keep reliable hours.  A sign on the door purports to show the hours that they're open, but they don't keep to that schedule.  I came by with a friend at about 8:05pm one night.  The sign said they were open until 9pm that night, but the place was totally closed --- not like just cleaning up, but totally dark and clearly had closed up much earlier.  Another time, when it was open, I asked the guy behind the counter what their hours were, and he couldn't give a straight answer either,.  Yet another time, while waiting for my tacos, I saw an employee of SBMenus (a local restaurant delivery service) come in and tell the Tacos El Rey employee that SBMenus has had to cancel delivery orders because the place wasn't open.  I've also popped by now and then when walking around downtown, only to find it closed probably about half the time.\n\nTo me, not being open when you say you'll be is a major transgression; I considered knocking them down to three stars but decided to be kind and stick with 4.  It's also doubly peculiar because the location is half a block off of lower State, a stone's throw from various bars and tons of tourist foot traffic.  These guys could be making money hand over fist if they opened reliably.  (I imagine they could make an absolute killing if they opened for late-night, like the former pita place in this location did.)\n\nThere's no question that the tacos are excellent, but I fear for the future of Tacos El Rey if they can't maintain consistent opening hours.  If you happen to pass by and see that they're open, definitely go for it, but if you're deciding whether or not to make a trip, it's risky because they may not be open when you arrive."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-11-20 22:10:41", "review_text": "Tacos de Barbacoa are at 100% on point. \nTaste just like the ones back in my Mexican hometown. \nDefinitely recommend them."}]}
