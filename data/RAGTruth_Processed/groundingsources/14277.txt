My husband and I have eaten here 3 times, and the food is always excellent. The wait staff is kind and attentive. The last meal I had there was the linguine bolognese and it was flavorful and fantastic with just enough sweetness. It was a perfectly balanced sauce. I ate the entire meal it was so good, and I rarely finish a plate of food. My husband had soup and salad, and he really enjoyed his meal, but could not finish the soup as the serving was quite large. We have always sat outside, and did so on this trip even though it was cold out. The wait staff gladly turned on one of the outdoor heaters for us and placed it perfectly so that we were comfortable. Love that they have a dog-friendly patio."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2016-11-24 07:53:09", "review_text": "Food was eh at best. You're not supposed to judge a book by its cover..  but if your bread doesn't inspire me to binge out my carby dreams, it's subpar. Bread should have a smell and texture,not remind me of wonder bread and all its blandness.  Other food was alright. Service and decor were pleasant enough. Prob will explore somewhere else if I'm in town again"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-11-08 12:42:02", "review_text": "Sat down Sunday 12:50 PM in an empty restaurant.
