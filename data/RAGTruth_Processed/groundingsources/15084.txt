They were super friendly, the food was piping hot exactly on time.\n\nThe food tasted great!! Large portions, lots of options and reasonable price! My girlfriend was also happy about the abundant vegetarian options. We will definitely be getting takeout here again soon! \n\np.s. the plain fried rice is... *really* plain lol"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-10-07 02:57:40", "review_text": "I'm obsessed with any Chinese food I can find in SB. Like obsessed since it isn't as easy as you would think to come by. I've had a few items to go from Shang Hai and every time it is quick, hot, and easy to order and pick up. My favorite is the Hot and Sour soup when I'm not feeling 100%. It comes a large to-go bowl so sit by the TV, curl up, and slurp away. The hot is both peppery and heat, but not too much to overwhelm the senses. Yum yum."}]}
