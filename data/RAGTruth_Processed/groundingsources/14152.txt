I didn't notice much during the daytime but at night, this place is an amazing place to hang out, talk with friends, meet up, or just get a great drink! I can't get enough of their black leather cocktail and while it's much like the Manhattan, it's a tad sweeter with just enough kick to keep your voice deep and low. For those sex gender antagonists, this drink will not make you \"less of a man\" or \" more of a man\". It's now my new favorite drink kicking old fashions, Moscow mules, and traditional Manhattan's done on my favorite drink list. If you don't like cocktail's that's OK. This place is mostly known for their wine as they have a large selection! Don't be fooled by this post as this isn't just a \"bar\" they have amazing vegan food from Rascal's that rivals that of LA and SF."}]}
