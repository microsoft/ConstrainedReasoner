I believe the fish was tilapia as it tasted muddy. We felt disgusted after eating there. The same type of fish was used in the fish taco. We were hungry and was super disappointed with the meal. If you want to eat muddy tasty fish, you can give it a try. It's worst than the frozen fish from the grocery store."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-09 18:16:50", "review_text": "Nice stop on the pier for coffee\n\nThis is a no frills, no fuss, coffee shop (but also serves  food?!) right on the edge of the pier.  It looks like they are not getting extremely high marks for food, but if you go into the place it doesn't feel like a spot for a gourmet meal. What it is great for, and why I'm giving it four stars, is because of the beautiful view over the pier.  It has some awesome seating on the rail, right outside. I suggest going there early in the morning, maybe even for sunrise, and getting a coffee. I also grabbed a bagel, toasted with cream cheese. It felt like a Bagel experience you would have at Starbucks or coffee bean. \n\nStop in for the coffee and the views!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-17 17:55:00", "review_text": "Absolutely my favorite spot for breakfast in Santa Barbara! Casual outdoor dining area on Stearns wharf with absolutely gorgeous view of the ocean and the hills of Santa Barbara. Francisco, Blanca and the rest of the staff are always friendly and offer excellent service. They serve a range of espresso drinks, and a nice breakfast (and lunch) menu. My personal favorite is the huevos rancheros.  A great place to eat and appreciate the beauty of Santa Barbara."}]}
