He took the time to work with us on a special first dance song that he custom mixed. Not to mention the DJ Flamezz crew was super accommodating in holding a new wedding date for us for a whole year dealing with COVID postponement. All around we had such a great time at our wedding and could not have done it without them!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-22 03:02:34", "review_text": "I can't say enough about Joe!! He is amazing and very personable! He walked us every little step of the way and made it so much easier than originally thought. He knew what we wanted from our ceremony on the beach, to the cocktail hour before our reception and most importantly made our reception a very memorable night!! We love Joe and highly recommend him!! We received compliments from all of our family and friends who attended our wedding!! They had such a blast and didn't want to stop dancing!! Thank you, Joe for making our wedding a night we won't forget!!! :)"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-07-19 12:30:00", "review_text": "Hired Flamezz and his team for a 10year business event and they were amazing! The dance floor didn't stop. The photo booth was also a hit. Flamezz was extremely flexible with my vision for the backdrop of the booth. Wish I could rewind the night and do it again! Thank you Flamezz and team! Can't wait to hire you again!"}]}
