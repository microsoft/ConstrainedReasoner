The entire hotel/resort is beautiful, so give yourself time to walk around and see everything. \n\nMichela, took care of my friend and me for brunch, and she was great.  Super attentive but not invasive, really friendly and nice, I'd honestly ask for her again because she was so great. My friend enjoyed the fancy avocado toast with mole on it with 2 perfectly poached eggs, and I had the eggs Benedict with the house smoked salmon sooooo good. The benedict was exactly the right amount of food, well dressed, and a great way to start the day.  We also took advantage of the $35 bottomless mimosas (for up to two hours). We made it worth it.\n\nWe booked a Lyft in advance to get to and from brunch so we could both be foolish. I highly recommend doing the same and scheduling in advance to ensure you can get a ride in a timely manner.\n\nThe place was definitely pricey, but everything was so good and it felt decadent and fun."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 01:41:09", "review_text": "This restaurant is great.
