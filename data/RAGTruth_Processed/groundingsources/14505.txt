First impressions, right??  But in the case of Jimboz, how could I not. I don't want to call myself a regular because honestly I have never been there at 10am for The Price Is Right and never make it more than once in a week.  But I will say I'm a huge fan!  I usually go on Tuesdays which is officially \"Ladies Night\".  But Alice is always working and treats me like her bestie!!! Nobody pours a Grand Mariner better than Alice.   What?  They do fancy???   Hell Yes!!  Premium tequilas, good Bourbon, they have it.... but most of all you feel at home, they have very welcoming regulars.   If someone is doing a food run, you will probably be included.   Isn't that what a neighborhood bar should be about??"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-04-15 23:35:01", "review_text": "Sometimes YOU \"get what YOU pay for\" & sometimes YOU get just WHAT you're looking for...!  Especially if it is that \"throwback\" friendly \"tavern\" of Ol'!  That The \"dufas hipsters\" like to refer as a \"dive bar\", because they have NO reference points in their own generation!\n\nAnyway if YOU are looking for a small, intimate NO FRILLS, friendly lil' place to \"toss back a few\" w/ your friends and/or solo THIS should be on your \"go to LIST\"...!!!\n\nPlenty of GOOD restaurants within in walking distance..."}]}
