Ok, so go to Isabella Gourmet Foods and let yourself eat a piece of heaven by getting the cocoa truffles. Isabella Gourmet Foods (IGF) carries an impressive selection of deliciousness. There is one in particular that is my favorite which is a rose cocoa truffle. \n\nBone broth at IGF is excellent because it includes the good for your body herbs and roots such as turmeric. \n\nThe sandwiches are a steal at under $10; very filling and combos such as waffles as bread and  turkey with delectable jam.\n\nFinally, the people are great that work at IGF! Amy is very knowledgable and is that person that you wish she was one of your best girlfriends. Such as cool, smart, sophisticated and still down to earth gal!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-04-10 07:10:14", "review_text": "Really fabulous selection of gourmet, local products! I love that I can purchase all of my local favorites and artisan products under one, convenient roof. \n\nIGF has the Matcha I like. \nIGF has the organic shrubs I use. \nIGF has the Sugar Cat Cake Mixes and Cookbook that I love. \nIGF has the Brown Sugar, Gourmet Popcorn that I crave!\n\nMy goodness, I could go on and on, but seriously the only thing that will really do this shop justice is for you to go in and see for yourself. The owner, Amy, or her GM, Amy, will likely be there ready to welcome you with a warm smile. \n\nWhether you're re-stocking your favorite products, shopping for the perfect gift or just want to browse - I'm sure you'll find something you love in this delightful, little boutique!"}]}
