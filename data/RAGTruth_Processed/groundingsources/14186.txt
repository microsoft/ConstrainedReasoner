We were staying close by and it was in walking distance from our hotel.  All seating was outdoor and they even have staff that will deliver the food to your table.  The selection of fresh pastries, muffins, bagels, cookies, etc. was awesome!  \nMy husband ordered the breakfast burrito which came with potatoes as well and I had the Lox and Bagel plate.  I've never been somewhere were they give you such a large amount of Salmon with a bagel plate!  The bagel was large and fresh tasting.  I couldn't even finish the plate, but it was delicious! \nHighly recommend this spot even though the line was long which says something, it moved quickly and we were glad we had stopped in!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-01-10 19:07:31", "review_text": "Permanently closed, alas. Another Covid casualty. Other locations will reopen.

This was one the top rated & so we made our drive up early one Sunday & popped into downtown for some brekkie. Being Sunday, it was quiet & there wasn't much traffic. Many streets were closed to through traffic to allow social distancing of pedestrian traffic.  Parking was found around the corner & upon arriving, there was naturally a line. It wasn't too long of a wait. Orders are placed at the counter & a number is given to you. You are free to find your own table. There is both indoor & outdoor seating & indoor was ok when we went in October, but I'd check to see what the current situation is. We sat outside, along the side of the building & it's all very pretty. The building has big windows that pretty much open up to the outdoors & views are lovely. Now onto our food!! I had a plate of French toast. Hubby had the breakfast burrito. Yes & yes to both. All the flavors & textures were there. Moistness (I know y'all hate that word but it's important with certain foods) was on point cause I've had many a dry French toast & this wasn't dry. No rubbery burrito here. Prices are about standard for cute boutique-y cafes of this sort. They also have these tempting looking pastries behind the glass at the counter. Try NOT to take one with you! 99.9% chance that scone will be going home with you. It probably won't make it that far."}]}
