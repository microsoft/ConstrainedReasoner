Once we got in the car I looked at the receipt and realized she made him a turkey sandwich so we went back in to ask her to add the other meat and to refund us and recharge the correct price since a club is a little more. She was very rude about it and told us she wasn't going to do anything about and proceeded to call us liars and say he asked for a turkey sub. I told her she didn't have to be so rude so she told me to \"get the f**k out b***h\" and if I had a problem with it I could \"call her f***ing manager\". Also she proceeded to cuss us as we walked out of the store. It was quite unacceptable and inappropriate of an employee to be this unprofessional and aggressive."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2020-03-02 20:05:55", "review_text": "Small store, personnel not very well organized, store is only moderately clean. \nStaff is friendly sometimes, other times they will only barely recognize you."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-07-10 01:49:07", "review_text": "Nice and clean location.
