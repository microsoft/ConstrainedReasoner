Michigan Rep Running for House Speaker
It has been an interesting couple weeks if you follow politics.
A few weeks ago, Republicans made history when they voted out their own Speaker, Kevin McCarthy.
McCarthy’s own election and brief stint was in itself rather historical, taking 15 rounds of voting to secure speakership.
Steven Scalise and Jim Jordan became the two names floated to replace McCarthy.
Jim Jordan brought it to a vote where he failed to secure a majority of votes for three consecutive rounds, losing votes each time.
Now things are back to square one.
A number of names have been thrown there out into the ring to become Speaker.
One of those is Michigan Representative Jack Bergman.
The Detroit Free reports that Bergman has decided to run after Jordan bowed out. Bergam voted for Jordan all three times.
Bergman took to X, the former Twitter, to say “My hat is in the ring, and I feel confident I can win the votes where others could not. I have no special interests to serve; I’m only in this to do what's best for our nation and to steady the ship for the 118th Congress.”
Bergman represents the Michigan 1st Congressional District. His district is made up of the entire Upper Peninsula as well as the northern part of the Lower Peninsula.
Before joining Congress, Jack Bergmanretired from the Marines as a Lt. General and is a Vietnam veteran.
Bergman states that the looming government shut down for why he wants to become Speaker, “The regular functioning of the federal government can’t wait on useless infighting and arguments," Rep. Bergman said. "What matters right now is choosing a Speaker in order to make sure that our government—and particularly our military—is funded, and that both our homeland and our critical allies are secure in this time of crisis."
