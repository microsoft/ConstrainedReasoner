You've walked up State Street, and you already realize that the place is packed wall to wall with 21 year olds trying to discover themselves and be cool, while drinking until they toss their cheap drinks into the bushes and call cabs or get toted off by police.  Now you are asking yourself, where the hell can I find a classy guy or girl, or meet up for dinner and drinks with my kind of crowd.  This is a great spot.  It's clean, trendy, has great arrangement of space, good music, without the dancing (which you can take a 2 block walk and find plenty of up the street) and it is a little off the main drag, so you don't feel like you're drinking on an ant hill with people who have to be in class in the morning!  The drinks are a bit more expensive to ward off the happy hour drunk and the beach cruiser loser who got lost on his way to Fig and Haley but well worth it.  and the bathrooms....did I tell you about the bathrooms?  Let's just say that it is the ONLY late night spot in SB with Co-Ed bathrooms, hint hint.  First time I was there I ran into an old friend, who showed me to the light.  Thanks to Jesse, I was broken in correctly surrounded by mirrors and cheered by bathroom goers upon exit, while my boring date, Kelly, sat at the bar oblivious!  You can have you some fun if your not careful at Sevilla!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2008-06-08 16:25:41", "review_text": "Sevilla, I am sorry to say, closed in May 2008.

If you are coming with a group this place is great - and very romantic for just two too! Ask for one of their booths for two if you are coming as a couple."}]}
