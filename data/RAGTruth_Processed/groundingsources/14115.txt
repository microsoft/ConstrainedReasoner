It is a totally different place.  The restaurant was about 1/4 full on a Friday night.  The food was very average and the bill was $143 for 3 with no alcoholic drinks.  The chips and guacamole was not great, not many chips and the guacamole was watery.  The salad lettuce did not seem fresh and crisp.  It was bland.  The salmon was decent.  The restaurant needs a complete overhaul as it is dirty, I.e. really dated/small restrooms, flies buzzing around the table and really dirty awnings overhead.   The staff was very young.  It is incredibly overpriced.  The restaurant could thrive again in such a great location on a creek, but it needs a new look and much better food, especially at the current prices."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-06-27 17:42:02", "review_text": "As locals, we are disappointed at the meal we had on Friday night. From what we remember this place used to be much better. The location is absolutely gorgeous and the staff seemed nice but inefficient- the pros end here. The menu is limited and overpriced, it features no local ingredients that scream Santa Barbara- like sea urchin and abundant farmer's market produce. Even the limited items they had on the menu were bland and lacked finesse and attention to detail. The service was inconsistent and the waitress kept apologizing for being busy, they brought us a cocktail menu but then never came back to ask if we chose a cocktail. They also had two hostesses upfront when there  was a huge abundance of tables and really you could sit yourself anywhere. From our experience there's an upgrade needed for both menu and structure."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-06-26 22:43:05", "review_text": "Wow!  Im really hoping this was an off night!  Made reservations and took 15 minutes to seat us and be acknowledged. We sat outside and took forever for our sever to appear. Finally arrived and ordered bottle water & 2 glasses wine. We had to ask for bread for table cause we were so hungry. Server took our order for Pasta Bolognese and Rib Eye with mash potatoes, asparagus. Took forever for our dinner to arrive. My pasta looked like hamburger helper and was so bland and my hubbs rib eye was so thin and looked like those commercials from Dennys & ihop for $9.99 no kidding. $165 later + tip was a disgusting dinner and should of went to Luckys, Holdrens, Jane any where but this place. Such a shame cause has great ambiance but the food & service was horrific!!  Will never support this restaurant as a local until they have a major change!"}]}
