When we arrived, the hostess couldn't have cared any less of the customers walking up to the hostess stand.  She saw us, but  kept on with wrapping up a call followed by helping the bartender behind her with some orders with no \"I'll be with you in a minute\" eye contact or communication with us. When she finally got around to helping us, we basically said two for dinner, but she said all the visible, empty tables were reserved.  Seriously? The dining room was twenty-five percent full, but we were told we can dine at the bar, which was completely full or take a seat out on the patio, which was fifty degrees out.  Um no.\n\nWe decided to just order a pizza to go and take it back to the room, I didn't want to deal with her much longer and I was getting more annoyed by the minute by her attitude.\n\nAfter we ordered the prosciutto pizza, we walked to our room and my husband went back to the restaurant to pick up our pizza.  When we opened the box, we both looked at each other like \"what the hell is this?\" I took a few bites and was pretty disappointed at how overly salty and oily it was.  My husband took one bite before we threw it out and ordered a way better dinner thanks to a local company that delivered food from a better selection of participating restaurants.  \n\nMy only regret?  Not knowing about the food delivery service from Restaurant Connection SB before going through the horrible dining experience at Blue Tavern."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-01-13 00:17:35", "review_text": "Unfortunately this restaurant is closed temporarily   Hopefully it will open soon.
