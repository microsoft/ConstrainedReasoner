Michigan Church Group Stuck in Israel
Over the last week, Israel was attacked by the terrorist group Hamas. Tensions mount as Israel mounts a response.
Israel has already locked down the West Bank and launched missiles at suspected terrorist sites.
United States President Joe Biden has sent one aircraft carrier strike group and is possibly sending a second in a show of support of Israel.
The attack also reaches people here in Michigan. Israel is a population destination for religious groups to visit.
Now, a Michigan church group is stuck in Israel.
Audacity reports there are at least two dozen members of a Novi based church in Israel. The country is locked down, and the Tel Aviv airport was a target of Mamas attacks.
Pastor Jon Morales, his wife Anna, and an additional 25 members of the Oak Pointe Church are in the country.
Anna told WWJ, “We were being told by people on the street and our tour guide to get inside the hotel. We could hear the booming, the bombs, as we were going in.”
Pastor Jon recounted rushing into the hotel basement as alarms sounded.
Jerusalem is north of where the attacks took place and so far the group is safe. They have not been able to make arrangements to get home.
“They’re accustomed to a degree of conflict and things happening, but this is just a different scale altogether. They’re just shocked, family members are being called to active duty,” Jon Morales said.
Several church groups around the country were in the country when the attacks happened. Detroit Lions Linebacker Alex Anzalone’s parents were part of a Florida based group and are also stuck in Israel.
So far at least nine Americans have died in the conflict and an unknown number have been kidnapped.
Reports indicate that Israel has regained control along the West Bank and has been launching retaliatory strikes.
