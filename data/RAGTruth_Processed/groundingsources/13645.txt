First, the place has a its  own character. Old and charming in a rustic way. All raw wood, no paint. It was like a movie set. What with the bikers as main characters. We were looking forward to the foot long tri tip sandwich but I think we made a mistake ordering. What came was like a six inch tri tip sandwich! I would have loved to take a photo a loooonnnngggg sandwich much like what the food blogger had. . Now, the beef was kind of dry and I think we got the very end of the tri tip. Not as tasty or juicy as I was expecting. Next time I order, I will make sure to say that I would like the middle part of the meat and not the end.\nI turned my attention to the vegetable salad and onion rings . I like the vegetable salad because the veggies were grilled and the  cranberry dressing was light and refreshing.  I wish they could have placed more.  \nThe onion rings  which we excitedly waited for were big and good too. We had to box the rest of it because it was too big for us.\n\nOverall , it is a regular sandwich place in a picnic setting. Relaxed and beautiful in its simplicity. \n\nIf you are showing friends around, I think  this is a good place to consider:"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-11 04:54:05", "review_text": "We came to this famous \"old stagecoach stop turned eatery\" on a cold winter day but the vibe here was super warm!   But if the vibe along isn't enough to warm your heart, the ginormous Tri-tip sandwich will certainly warm your stomach! \n\nThe meat was done to perfection and the bun was soft... and they give you so much that the two halves of the bun hardly close!  \n\nIf you buy the $13 sandwich, you'd have to eat out in open tables. There's a restaurant but hard to get into. \n\nThe ambiance is rustic, casual and relaxing. Parking can be difficult as this famous joint is super popular!  \nCHECK THEIR HOURS before you come (they are not open every day like other restaurants) so you don't end up driving the distance and get disappointed. Lastly, my guess is this place is more enjoyable in the summertime as the shady tree-lines areas can be cold in the winter."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 18:06:34", "review_text": "Although the food was good and the setting was nice.
