{"question": "how to draw a truncated cone in geogebra", "passages": "passage 1:Page 1 of 2 Compliments of: Bob Bartelme Backwoods Tin & Copper, LLC Creating a Pattern to make a Cone (Frustum of a Cone) Step By Step Instructions Step Visual Aid 1. Draw the shape you want to make. Example: A cone with a 6\u201d diameter base, a height of 5 inches and a top diameter of 3.50 inches.\n\npassage 2:The truncated cone is a lot like a lampshade. I've drawn one below with some helping lines labelled t, b, h and w : So t is the diameter of the circular top of the cone, b is the diameter of the circular bottom, h is the height of the cone and w is the diagonal width. You have measurements for all these except w.\n\npassage 3:The diameter of the base will be 2 inches and the diameter of the top will be .25 inches. The height will be 7 inches. As before, think about extending the conical figure up to a point and put it Paula's numbers. That is, this pedestal is formed by cutting off a cone with a base having a diameter of .25 inches.\n\n"}
