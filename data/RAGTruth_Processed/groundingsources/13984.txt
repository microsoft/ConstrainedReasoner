Russia Withdrawing From Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
Lawmakers in Russia have moved forward with approving a bill that would revoke the previous ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1996, the treaty was hailed as a step towards prevention of potential future nuclear conflicts. With the withdrawal of Russia from the treaty, its effectiveness will be significantly weakened, as well as make it possible that other states might take a similar action in the future.
According to the Kremlin, the United States has approached Russia behind the scenes in an attempt to resume important talks on issues of arms control and stategic stability, supposedly "in isolation from everything that is happening." That being said, with the ongoing war against Ukraine, which the United States and its allies have taken significant steps to support, Russia has indicated to the press that a return to a dialogue with the United States simply isn't possible right now.
The move comes as Russia previously announced on October 6 that they would be withdrawing from the treaty, the stated intent of which was to "mirror" the position of the United States which, despite having signed on to the treaty, has never been able to ratify it. Passed by both the upper house and lower house of the Russian government, the bill only needs President Putin's signature and Russia will have formally withdrawn from the treaty. Whether or not this move leads to Russia restarting nuclear testing in the months and years ahead remains to be seen, though the fact that there remains only a single bilateral nuclear weapons treaty between the United States and Russia (New START which places limits on nuclear weapons), which itself might well expire in 2026, likely indicates that there will be significant worries in the years ahead regardless.
