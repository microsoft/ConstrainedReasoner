Absolutely a stunning setting. They have a pond area that is so beautiful and peaceful. The staff there is unbelievably nice, kind and accommodating. I really can't say enough good things about them. I coordinated with Rochelle the reservations for a surprise proposal for my niece and she couldn't have been more helpful. We were served by Autumn the day of and she was an absolute life saver and so kind to make the day so perfect and special. I can't thank them enough for everything. Go there enjoy it!! You will fall in love easily!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-25 21:02:48", "review_text": "Great wine tasting experience. Staff was very accommodating of our larger party.
