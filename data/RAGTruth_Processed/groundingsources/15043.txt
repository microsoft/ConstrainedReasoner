Yes, they've shrunk the menu a bit, but only to make room for improvements in quality. Their breakfast burritos are awesome ($8.50) and they really bother to take the time to assemble them properly, so you don't end up with - for example - all egg at one part and all potatoes at another. They also give them a nice toast on the grill before serving, which heats everything up evenly and melts the cheese. The homemade green salsa has a KICK and it's delicious !! New owners are friendly and responsive - I look forward to seeing what changes come in the future."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2011-09-24 19:04:49", "review_text": "Wow, they totally changed the menu!  I've eaten lunch and take-out here for about 17 years and seen at least three different proprietors. The two brothers who owned the place in the late 90s were a terrific comedic duo. The giant deli menu behind the counter is gone, what will I eat?  I was assured by the cashier that most of the former items would still be available, at least for now,  and indeed my grilled BLT with avocado and melted cheddar and provolone  was delicious. In fairness I'll have to try some of the new menu selections. The apparent new owners were friendly and energetic with customers.  Pretty brave to start a new business in these simpler times. Best of luck to them.  I'll certainly check in for a new review soon:)"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2011-02-17 20:37:18", "review_text": "The food is good. It's your typical mom & pop type restaurant. What makes this place great is the service. Everyone at the restaurant is very attentive. They've given me free french fries more than once."}]}
