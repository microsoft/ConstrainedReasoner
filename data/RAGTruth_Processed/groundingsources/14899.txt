Being UCSB students who lived in IV searching for affordable decent middle eastern food, my roommate and I found this gem. We would make the commute pretty much weekly just to go here. Like yeah Zaytoons is great and all but when you're trying to ball on a budget you gotta go someplace else for a middle eastern fix. To be perfectly honest the place was pretty good. You definitely got much more for what you pay for compared to other middle eastern food places in IV. I liked my beef shawarma. He liked his chicken shawarma. We were both happy. Once we found out this place closed we were both in despair. Nothing lasts forever I guess :'(\n\nREST IN KEBAB MAGIC PITA 2014. YALL BE MISSED"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2014-04-06 19:18:48", "review_text": "Basic mediterranean nothing special here. Points for being after midnight go-to. Owner is a nice dude, Kilo or Phylo or something. Staff b.s. around with each other (talk, laugh) so orders take longer than they would if they were concentrating. Seems to attract a more ghetto late night crowd than the Blue Owl & I'm sure being right next to a smoke shop (hookah shop? Don't know I didn't go in) helps with that. Mad amounts of Taxis park in front so unless you like shady looking mexican dudes staring at you while you grub get it to go. Not much room to eat inside, never tried it."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2014-03-21 04:03:28", "review_text": "I wanted to like this place because I truly enjoy Middle Eastern cuisine and there is not much choice in that category here in Santa Barbara.  Unfortunately, I will not be going back for more food from the Magic Pita Cafe.  There was way, way too much garlic used in many of the dishes; I got sick from it, not to mention the resultant bad breath.  The water-logged salad was loaded with onion- more b.b.  The meat was overcooked. And the servers neglected to include pita bread in my order which I discovered only after I got home.  A sad disappointment."}]}
