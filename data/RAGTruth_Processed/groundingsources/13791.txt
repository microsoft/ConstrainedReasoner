I made the mistake of bringing in my own cup to reuse. Before I could finish my sentence one of the figures asks me if I have a receipt. Now how many of you carry around a Coffee Bean receipt with you? He was under the impression I was trying to save a dollar or so. I corrected him saying I was trying to be sensitive to the environment. It was awkward. Seems like a minor thing and it is, but during the pandemic you'd think the first thing out of an employee's mouth is not asking to see my receipt and it's the only CBT store that's ever done so. BTW, they use paper straws so you'd think they'd get the environment thing."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2020-02-23 07:42:22", "review_text": "First of all, this location is quite small and cute, and the service was p friendly!! I appreciate how they use paper straws! As a positive, they are super upfront about the nutrition of their drinks, with each item on the menu labeled with its calories. They also have lightened versions of drinks like their matcha latte if you want a lower cal option. I think this is so helpful! \nI ordered a Vietnamese cold brew, and would recommend! Not quite the authentic Vietnamese coffee you would get at other places, but pretty close! Super rich and a good source of caffeine if you need it :) Not very many interesting options on the drink menu, tho. A pretty standard coffee shop I would say."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-12-22 01:15:05", "review_text": "I had such a great experience at this coffee bean and tea leaf. Christine the store manager was awesome!\nAs I got my drinks sitting against the window with my mom she checked in to make sure our drinks were good... that meant a lot! What a great attitude she has!"}]}
