We ordered garlic bread, a focaccia urger, kids mac and cheese, and spaghetti with meatballs. The garlic bread was okay but didn't really taste like garlic. The mac and cheese was gritty and extremely hot when they served it (which I would prefer to cold but my 3 year old wasn't too happy about having to wait to eat it). We can usually tell if we are going to like an italian restaurant based on their red sauce and I would have to say it was just okay. The focaccia burger was also just okay. I don't think we'll try it again."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2013-07-29 05:17:04", "review_text": "It's amazing this restaurant is still open.  They have a really good beet salad, but the restaurant is almost always empty.  They recently took down an overhead portion above the bar and it's really lightened the place up.  I like the booths which give you the ability to have a private conversation and they're comfortable.  The bread is okay.  They often have coupons in the paper for buy one, get one free and that's what makes it worth coming back for (and I really like the beet salad)."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-07-25 04:04:52", "review_text": "I love this restaurant! From beginning to end we had an excellent experience.  Casey our waiter was attentive and friendly.  We had italian sodas and we were so happy to get a huge carafe of refills, then we had delicious garlic bread and salad.  The portions are big and we shared a salad and it was plenty for two.  We had the ahi and it was tasy, followed by the penne pasta which we also shared and they kindly split our entrees into two plates for us.  The finale was the s'mores dessert which is fun and delicious.  We were visiting from out of town or I would frequent this restaurant.  Casey made us want for nothing and I so appreciate good service AND good food, that makes for a great dining experience!"}]}
