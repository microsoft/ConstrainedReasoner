{"question": "how to roast individual garlic cloves", "passages": "passage 1:1 Garlic roasting time is dependent on the size of your garlic cloves. Note that it may take up to 45 minutes or even an hour for your cloves to soften if they are large.  Store roasted garlic cloves in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.\n\npassage 2:Season the garlic cloves to taste with herbs and spices, if you like. For kick, add some cayenne or chipotle pepper powder, Cajun seasoning mix or curry powder. Dried oregano, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, tarragon or basil work well, too. Choose seasonings to complement the food you're using the roasted garlic with.\n\npassage 3:One or more whole heads of garlic. Method. 1 Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (205\u00b0 C). 2 Peel and discard the papery outer layers of the whole garlic bulb, leaving intact the skins of the individual cloves of garlic. Using a sharp knife, cut 1/4 to a 1/2 inch from the top of cloves, exposing the individual cloves of garlic. 3 Place the garlic heads in a baking pan, cut side up. (A muffin pan works great for this, as it keeps the garlic bulbs from rolling around.) Drizzle a couple teaspoons of olive oil over each exposed head, using your fingers to rub the olive oil over all the cut, exposed garlic cloves.\n\n"}
