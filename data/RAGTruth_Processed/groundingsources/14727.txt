Here's what happened:  I was sitting at the bar drinking a beer and eating some nachos when this gorgeous girl, Katie, and her friend walked in. They sat next to me and I noticed that Katie had the same phone as me, a crappy freebie phone they give you when you lose your iphone, and so I said, \"Hey I like your crappy cell-phone, did you lose your iphone like me?\"  As it turned out she had.  We swapped stories about how we had drunkenly lost our phones and after that we just kept talking.  She was making me laugh telling raunchy jokes and I was trying to impress her by weaving beach volleyball stories into the conversation.\n\nThe whole time the bartender kept our drinks flowing and made sure we were having a good time.  At one point when the conversation ran dry and I was about to pay my bill and go. Luckily I got the signal from the bartender, \"stick around, this girl likes you.\" I'm hopelessly ignorant to the subtle signals of the opposite sex, and if I hadn't taken his advice I probably would have blown it.  We kept talking for a while and I finally asked her for her number.  Not only did she give me her number, but she walked with me to my car, gave me a kiss on the cheek, flashed me a smile, and made sure I was going to call her.\n\nNeedless to say, I did.  We met up a few days later for drinks and we had a great time.  We've been hanging out pretty steadily for a few weeks now and things are going really well.  I had to write a review and thank the guys at Peabody's for hooking me up.  I'm a regular at Peabody's now for sure."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2012-03-09 09:42:31", "review_text": "My girlfriend and I were staying at the hotel behind this restaurant and decided to try it out after a long day of shopping and sight seeing. After reading some previous comments about service, we were a bit hesitant but decided to roll the dice. We were pleased to find that this place stayed open till midnight on weeknights. We arrived on a Thursday @ 10:30 p.m and were quickly greeted and told to sit anywhere we wanted. We sat next to a warm fire at the fireplace in the lounge but waited a very very long time for someone to take our order........we immediately started talking about the poor service stories we read earlier. After waiting for an eternity, I was forced to walk our order to the bartender (Warren) personally which he promptly took care of. We received our food and drinks in a timely manner and found the calamari and sliders to be hot , fresh, and very tasty. Again, we found ourselves searching for a server to refill our beers but to no avail and ended up walking to the bar for service. Although we found the service to be substandard as we read earlier.....the bartender (Warren) eventually personally came to our table and apologized for us being neglected and without hesitation offered to buy us a round of beers and shots of tequila. With that said, the service was as expected (we did get there @ 10:30 p.m. though) the food was very good, and Warren going above and beyond any other bartender ever has for us made our evening a very enjoyable experience. We highly recommend this restaurant and ask for Warren - he'll take great care of you."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2012-01-31 02:06:09", "review_text": "ugh.... this place is horrible.\n          I have been here many, many times I can honesly cant remember a plate that I ordered that was any good.  Whatever you do, do NOT order any pasta.  Its rubbery and microwaved every single time....\n      This is a real bummer because my wife and I went on our first date here and to be totally frank, I still have no desire to ever return.\n      This place is totally avoidable...."}]}
