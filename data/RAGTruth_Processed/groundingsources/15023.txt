Going to go back but honestly want to ask for larger portions on the rice. Felt like it was small even for a child.

The bar was set low and I had hoped that they could have served me some decent chicken, but, alas, they could not. Chicken was greasy but not in a good way. The beans and rice had the texture and taste as if they had been laying out for most of the day. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed with food. I'm not surprised considering the photos on google look like stock photos, pretty lame. Do yourself a favor and go down to El Mercado plaza near the 154 and hit up El Rincon or Palapa(next to the adult store and methadone clinic) both of those places will give you a meal worthy of your hard earned money. This place has decided to continue in the mediocre footsteps of El Pollo Loco and have, somehow, taken the food down  another step. Perhaps they are competing for the worst food in town award? PASS."}]}
