{"question": "medicare claim number a and t", "passages": "passage 1:More than 4,500 people a day sign up for Medicare. In the coming decade, 18 million more people are expected to qualify, bringing Medicare enrollment to 74 million people by 2025. New beneficiaries are often surprised, even shocked, to find that their Medicare cards carry their Social Security numbers.\n\npassage 2:First, you signed up for Medicare only at age 65. Second, when you turned 66, you filed for husband's benefits on your wife's Social Security record. And third, when you reached age 70, you switched from your wife's account to your own retirement benefits. So at age 65, they had to give you a Medicare number. But they couldn't use your Social Security number with an A behind it, because as I explained in the first answer, that A means you are getting retirement benefits. And at age 65, you were not getting any Social Security benefits. So the Social Security Administration had to come up with another letter code for folks in your situation, and they chose T. So between age 65 and 66, your first Medicare card had your Social Security number with a T behind it.\n\npassage 3:Personally, I don\u2019t carry my original Medicare card. I carry a photocopy from which I have removed part of the Social Security number. I give my Social Security number verbally to the health care provider at the time I present the photocopy of the card and request services.\n\n"}
