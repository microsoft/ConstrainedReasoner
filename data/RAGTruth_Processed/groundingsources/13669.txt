I love the Jeannine's in Montecito. But this one is just not that great. Coffee is not great , I think the drink coffee is a good indicator on how serious a place takes their coffee and this place does not do great coffee. I ordered chilequiles and we super excited since I love that dish most places I go to but tbh it was the worst chilequiles I've ever had. The taste was bitter and even my dad who eats everything and is not picky didn't eat it. Also I asked specifically not to overlook my eggs, and they were overcooked. Bummer! Paid 7 for fresh OJ... also not tasty. Ordered French toast for my boy and it was definitely the best thing we ordered. I also got a croissant and I know this is brutal but Costco makes them better. Sorry guys I hate to be so negative but to spend 65 bucks on breakfast that was a MAJOR let down. I will not be going back."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-15 17:47:45", "review_text": "Visiting from SF - this place is excellent. Don't be out off by it's location in a mall. \n\nThe food and service are top notch and the decor inside is super cute. \n\nWe had the French toast and Avo toast with matcha lattes made with oat milk. \n\nEverything was made perfectly and was really delicious. The eggs had deep Orange yolks and were also super tasty. \n\nTwo thumbs up!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-07 20:07:50", "review_text": "I absolutely love the ambiance, and the attentive service.\nThe french toast was delicious!\nFresh OJ gets a two thumbs up!\nNow the bacon!
