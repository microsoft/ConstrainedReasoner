Everyone was lined up in this mall for KFC, when just a few doors down, THERE is the chicken mecca. Chicken in a Barrel is awesome. We first \"discovered\" it in Kauai, then stumbled upon their location in Tahoe. Now, to our surprise, this Goleta location, the biggest we've seen yet. Great ribs, ample sides, and THE best chicken around. It's expensive for what it is (no frills everything), but worth the relative \"splurge\" for this tasty fare. The customer service was great too. Enjoy!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-12-23 01:42:29", "review_text": "There's not a lot of places you can get Hawaiian bbq in santa Babara. This place was epic. Bbq chicken is killer."}]}
