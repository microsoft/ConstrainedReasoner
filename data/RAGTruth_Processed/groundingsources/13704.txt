What're can I say; I was craving a cheeseburger and this one delivered. \nFries - thin and crisp, the way I like them. \nTater tots - a bit under-seasoned but good. \nChicken Pot pie - definitely a show stealer. Highly recommend eating with the fries; kind if like fries and gravy. \nShrimp sandwich - so far the only low point. A single shrimp butterflied and served on a sandwich. Good, but nothing I couldn't do on a lazy afternoon at home. \nTurkey burger - heavy in the seasoning and quite tasty. \nBerry crisp - another show stealer. Not what I was expecting, and definitely was very happy to order it, and will again without hesitation. \nDark chocolate frozen banana pieces - pretty much the same as I make at home on hot summer afternoons. Nothing to write home about."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2013-12-14 03:12:49", "review_text": "Went here on a Friday night, only 3 tables had people and 2 people at the bar.  There was no one to seat us.  Finally the guy from the bar came to seat us.  They wanted to seat us next to the bathroom.  We asked to be seated elsewhere and they gave us another table in the empty restaurant.  We sat down, and waited and waited and waited.  We were never offered to order anything, so we got up and left.  We should've known the reason it was empty is the service is bad, maybe their food is good but I'll never know."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-11-10 09:37:30", "review_text": "I am glad I'm finally getting around to this review. I went here in a pleasant October evening after a few drinks at OKR, craving some late night eats and pleasant company. While service at the bar was slow and relatively inattentive I was able to get my order in of an old fashioned, the wild boar slider, onion rings, and Mac and cheese. First, the bad. Never, ever, ever list a menu item as truffle (blank) if you are just going to use truffle oil. It tastes like stale olive oil and chemicals. Also, use some sharp cheese. The creaminess was on point, but the flavor of the cheese was overwhelmed by the pungent odder of the truffle oil. The next, the mediocre. The onion rings were more onion straws, but semantics and preference aside, not bad. They weren't greasy, and for $3.50 served up quite the plate. But the highlight of the meal (and the warrant for 5 stars) was the wild boar slider and the expertly crafted old fashioned. The slider was juice, porky, and a pleasant several bites that I couldn't imagine tasting better. The patty was juicy and sumptuous, leaving little more to be desired. No condiments needed. The old fashioned was strong and Smokey, perfect for a chilly night and paired with the boar perfectly. I will (and have) returned frequently for your small, yet satisfying, bites of perfection. Just hold the truffle oil next time."}]}
