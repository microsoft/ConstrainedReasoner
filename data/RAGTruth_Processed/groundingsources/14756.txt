The place is beautiful, but some issues with the bill and somewhat the food.\n\nI had both the Crispy Yukon grilled potatoes, and the Lido's breakfast sandwich. The potatoes were delicious, and I found them to be more delicious than the sandwich. The potatoes also had a very generous serving.\n\nThe main issue I have, is the 20% service fee that is automatically added to your bill. It's not stated anywhere on the menu, or by the servers. Now I don't mind paying a 20% service fee if I was aware of it, but this restaurant does not notify you about it. Do not be fooled. Add tip on top of this, and you have a fee that's almost 40-50% of your meal. Would not come again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-10 01:53:26", "review_text": "New hours and the system as of Sept 5...now the restaurant is open for breakfast from 7am instead of 8.  Also, you can place your order with a server if you're dining in (instead of lining up at the bar counter).\n\nThe catch is...if you would like to dine outdoors, you'd have to wait till 8am when the pool opens.  Also, be aware it gets very busy between 9am and 10:30sh weekends as usual.\n\nAll servers are consistently good, friendly, and efficient!\n\nTheir lunch and dinner options are good as well.  I was going to have dinner @ Costa, but ended up eating (mussels) here after seeing someone else's meal.  ;)"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-08-18 17:19:00", "review_text": "The food is OK. The granola was not bad. The date shake was so so as well. It really got to me was it took forever for the waiter to come to the table. \n\nI'm top of that I can't stand companies that demand 20% gratuity regardless of service. I understand if it's a table of six or more etc. or even demanding 15 or 18 percent. But as someone who typically tips over 25% when I am demanded it really bothers me. If this has to do with fair wages then raise the prices of the items. Then you leave it up to the market to decide. But there's nothing posted anywhere that says a mandatory 20% tip. That's my other problem. If you're going to require that we need to disclose it on the front door."}]}
