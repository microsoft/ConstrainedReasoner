The place doesn't look attractive inside to order and the guy taking the orders isn't smiling but the food will make you smile.  We've been several times now and we order something different every time. Top faves are red dragon, caterpillar and rainbow rolls. Also the hand rolls have all been delicious.  We plan to try the poke bowls next. There are only a few tables outside so it's best to take to-go. Be careful with the birds above the tables, we saw one table get a gross surprise from them."}]}
