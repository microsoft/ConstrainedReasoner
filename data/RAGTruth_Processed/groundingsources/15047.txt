It has lots of outdoor seating and a fun tiki vibe. \n\nMy friend and I sat at the bar, the seats are a little close together, but we were there early enough that it didn't matter.  We shared a \"Miami Vice\" which is a pina colada, and a strawberry daquari served side by side in a class conch shell, delicious and very lovely.  We also tried the Mango Lassi and the Arroz Con Pollo, which were both really good, would absolutely order again.\n\nGreat friendly service, slightly pricey because of the location but worth it.  We didn't eat any of the food but it looked and smelled good.  And as a bonus, the brewery \"Modern Times\" is in the back, so if you're into beer, just walk straight through!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 05:13:12", "review_text": "Came to this place because of its high rating. To my surprising, there was no waiter or waitress at the time when we were there. We had to go to the bar and ordered our drinks there. That's definitely in convenient. The drinks were good and we liked them. We might come again to check if there's waiters or waitress at different times."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-25 05:04:14", "review_text": "After spending the afternoon in the Funk Zone, we made our way up State Street to get drinks at Shaker Mill. We had a good experience at their sister location Test Pilot (both are managed by Good Lion Hospitality), so we decided to give this Cuban-themed cocktail bar a try.\n\nIt's located inside the Kim's Service Department building, which is a mixed-use space. Parking is available in the surrounding streets, and there's also public lots/garages nearby.\n\nYou can sit outside on the front patio, in the bar area, or at the tables near Cubaneo. There's another business towards the back called Modern Times, which is a craft beer place. The atmosphere is slightly rustic, with a mostly tropical theme. Plants, ornamental light fixtures, garage doors as windows, and exposed wooden beams make the space feel industrial, yet cozy at the same time.\n\nCubaneo's menu consists of sandwiches, sides, and other Cuban plates. Shaker Mill serves wine, beer, cocktails, and a few non-alcoholic drinks.\nWe ordered chips with guac for the table, which were nicely hot and freshly made. Since I had a long drive after, I decided to get the boozeless Seasonal Shrub Soft Cocktail. It was light, refreshing, and well-crafted! Everyone in our group enjoyed their drinks, and we had a great time socializing.\n\nOverall a fun place to hang out if you're strolling around downtown and need a pick-me-up."}]}
