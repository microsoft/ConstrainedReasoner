However, it is well worth a visit, especially around lunch time. Some of the food may not be particularly pleasing to the avowed meat eater, but as long as you're willing to have a healthy meal with a good dose of greens, you're in a good place. \n\nI remember standing in the restaurant reading a review that was posted on the wall. It mentioned something about how most patrons are avid fans of dishes that could double as as \"rabbit food.\" I laughed. It's almost true. ALMOST being the operative word. If you're looking for a healthy meal that is delicious AND won't leave you clutching your bowels, fighting a food induced coma while feeling like you have a baby pig sleeping inside your stomach, Le Bon is the place to go.\n\nTry the sandwiches around lunchtime - they're light, delicious, and unforgettable! Instead of opting for bread, try the carb-free option, lightly fried crushed bananas. The chef forms the banana covering into a bread-like form, and uses that instead! Get any of the sandwiches this way - I ordered the eggplant mozarella sandwich. They have a delectable pesto that adds a pleasant kick to a healthy sandwich. \n\nYou'll leave feeling refreshed, healthy, and...(gasp) satisfied! I'm a carnivorous creature myself and usually think everything can be improved with a side of steak. However, Le Bon satisfied my leaf-eating side to the max. Now that's something, coming from someone who wants to eventually start a \"Beef Depot.\""}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2007-07-02 06:33:59", "review_text": "I want to give this one another chance... See the thing is, I wanted to like it more than I did. The menu looks promising--I was enticed by lamb bahn mi, plaintain sandwiches, fish and chips made with sweet potato fries--but the results were just okay. That said, the vibe is great, the staff is super sweet, and they have lots of fresh salads and yummy juices. I'll definitely go back and repost once I've tried again."}]}
