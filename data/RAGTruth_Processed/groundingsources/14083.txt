When he said his family always orders and it's the best in town. I just had to try. \nThey did not disappoint. Pizza crust was soft and the crust had flavor on the bbq chicken pizza was so good just the pizza sauce was just the right tangy We also got chicken wing plain and ranch dipping sauce. I was disappointed on the size of the wings but it was well seasoned even without ranch dip it was very good. \nThey also impressed me by verifying my order with a call back since i was staying in a hotel near by. \nThe pizza was promised 45 min but to my surprise it even came earlier."}]}
