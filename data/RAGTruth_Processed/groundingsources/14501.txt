Everything is fresh and organic. They have tons of plant based and gluten free options and the information about allergens is very clear on the menu. Great place to satisfy people with different dietary needs. \n\nThe kombucha on tap is delicious and so are the cookies. \n\nThey also have a lovely little market, an outdoor play area for kids, and an all around good vibe. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-20 02:40:09", "review_text": "Wonderful friendly people! I have been waiting to come in so I could bring my 91 year old Mom.\nWe went in and had a couple of burgers & fries.\nI ate mine like I hadn't eaten in days. I'm sure I embarrassed myself! Mom loved hers too. She is a slow eater but was enjoying the atmosphere so much it was hard to keep her attention on the food.\nNow let me tell you about the fries! There was a lady that mentioned to me they were the beat fries she ever had. I had to try for myself. I was not disappointed! They are! Yum to the max! They are comfort to the max!\nNext visit I shall try the veg sam.\nI had a hard time making up my mind."}]}
