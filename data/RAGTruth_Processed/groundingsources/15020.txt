With our large group we fortunately got to try them all . . . and each one was incredibly delicious.\n\nNotable wine-by-the-glass which was perfect for the entire meal: Grimm's Bluff, Happy Canyon, Rose of Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nAs cool as this special night was we were seated outside and comfortably next to one of their fireplaces, and surrounded by their portable heaters. \n\nOur server Laurel stuck with us from beginning to end, and she made sure the food came out promptly, and was excellent with her wine and cocktails recommendations. Can't say enough how thorough she was in making sure our night was special. Also special thanks to host Alberto for keeping an eye on us throughout the evening. \n\nHighly recommend making reservations to this very special restaurant as it is truly a hot-spot in Santa Barbara. Afterwards Alberto walked us next door to Pearl Social for a continued evening of specialty cocktails."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-11 05:56:35", "review_text": "The food was good to great, where the experience fell apart was in the service.    The restaurant was mostly empty when we arrived yet (during covid)  we were seated right next two other tables.   I assumed the other tables had reservations but remained empty for the remainder of our stay.   The staff was oblivious to the tables they did have, forgetting to recover tables when food was served, ignoring customers waving checks ready to leave, adding plates to our table without removing empty dishes.  Everyone was on autopilot.   It was a real shame because the food was beautiful and delicious.   I would not return despite that."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-05 14:50:22", "review_text": "My partner and I celebrated our anniversary the other night here. It was our first time and our waiter Oscar was friendly and treated us so well! \n\nExperience: 5/5\nWe were welcomed with a little anniversary card which was very thoughtful.  The outdoor seating area was really nice and there were heat lamps to keep us warm. The food came out in a timely manner and when we were done with everything, Oscar brought out some complimentary pours of rose to celebrate our special night. Thanks Oscar, you're awesome!!\n\nFood: 4/5\nWe were brought some popcorn to snack on before the meal. Not sure what the seasoning is but it's really good! The mushroom tartine we ordered was also great and probably my favorite item of the night. Brussel sprouts were delicious too but the sauce was a little heavy for me. Lastly, the famous boneless fried chicken was tasty but not the best fried chicken I've ever had. Maybe I just prefer bones-in. I enjoyed the various dipping sauces on the plate as well.\n\nDrinks: 5/5\nMy partner had the black Manhattan and I had the gimlet and both were very good, no complaints.\n\nDefinitely want to come back to try everything else on the menu!"}]}
