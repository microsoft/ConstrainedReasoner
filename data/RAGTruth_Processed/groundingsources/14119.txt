Walked by this place so many times, always wanted to try it but never really got around to it till I went with a friend, it was her favorite place. Food was absolutely amazing, as were the drinks, and the atmosphere was really nice. Only weird thing was one of the servers had a tiny crop top bra thing on with a bunch of chains which seemed a little out of place."}]}
