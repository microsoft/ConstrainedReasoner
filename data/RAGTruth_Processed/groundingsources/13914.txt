California man sentenced to prison after unwanted touching on flight to LAX
A 50-year-old man from Diamond Bar, Mohammad Jawad Ansari, was sentenced today to 21 months in federal prison after being found guilty of abusive sexual contact during a flight from Cleveland to Los Angeles in February 2020.
United States District Judge Fernando L. Aenlle-Rocha handed down the sentence, along with additional fines and the requirement for Ansari to register as a sex offender.
The incident occurred on February 17, 2020, as the flight took off from Cleveland Hopkins International Airport bound for Los Angeles International Airport.
Ansari was seated in a window seat, with the victim occupying the middle seat beside him.
The victim, wearing a dress, had fallen asleep shortly after takeoff, and the armrest separating Ansari from her was down.
During the flight, Ansari intentionally touched the victim's inner thigh without her consent.
A witness seated in the aisle noticed Ansari's actions and alerted the victim. Upon being awoken and made aware of the assault, the victim immediately reported the incident to a flight attendant.
Following a four-day trial, a jury found Ansari guilty of one count of abusive sexual contact on May 9.
In the sentencing memorandum, prosecutors stressed the severe impact this incident had on the victim, causing her immediate distress and lasting emotional trauma. The victim now experiences fear and anxiety while traveling, a lasting consequence of the assault.
The investigation into this matter was conducted jointly by the FBI and the Los Angeles Airport Police, leading to Ansari's conviction and subsequent sentencing.
In addition to the prison term, Judge Aenlle-Rocha ordered Ansari to pay a $33,750 fine, $1,600 in restitution, a $100 special assessment, and an additional $5,000 special assessment.
