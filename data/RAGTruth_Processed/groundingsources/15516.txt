{"question": "what is the difference between halt and hass", "passages": "passage 1:HALT, HASS and ESS. Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) Highly Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) is a stress testing methodology used during the engineering development phase of a product to quickly reveal design weaknesses.\n\npassage 2:HALT is run during the design phase of a program to find design weaknesses and eliminate them. Any stress that exposes design weaknesses that would show up in the normal environments is suitable even if these stresses do not occur in the normal environments to which the product will be exposed.\n\npassage 3:The HASS process is a production screen to assure that weak components are precipitated (failed). HALT experience and the step stress empirical evaluation is used to establish a good screen. It is important that the level of stress is tailored to the product. There is no one-stress-fits-all.\n\n"}
