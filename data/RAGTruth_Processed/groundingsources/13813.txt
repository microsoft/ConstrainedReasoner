Broken Arrow, Oklahoma - The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma has recently ruled in favor of a preliminary injunction, effectively preventing three individuals and two corporations from advancing their deceptive debt collection activities.
Key Points
Details of the Accused:
Christopher Parks, 62, presently detained in Cushing, Oklahoma, is accompanied in this scheme by his son, Christopher Noah Parks, 29, from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and Stephen Miller, 39, also from Broken Arrow.
They jointly operated Assured Collections LLC and Assured Financial LLC.
The defendants are accused of disseminating numerous false debt collection notices to consumers nationwide through their companies.
These notifications wrongly claimed that the consumers were in debt, often amounting to several thousand dollars, specifically for durable medical equipment.
This was done even though they had no legal authority to approach these consumers over any debt.
A significant portion of these fraudulent notifications was directed at older citizens and veterans, making the scheme even more heinous.
As per the allegations, Christopher Parks, who recently faced an 18-month prison sentence due to his guilty plea in a conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, together with Christopher Noah Parks and Stephen Miller, were fully aware of the fraudulent nature of these debt notices. Regardless of this knowledge, they persistently tried to deceive and collect from consumers.
