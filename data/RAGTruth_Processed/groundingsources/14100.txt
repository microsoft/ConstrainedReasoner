We are so glad we made that decision! Carole and her team are well known in the Santa Barbara area and were so helpful in recommending vendors, and ideas to keep our wedding stress-free. We booked with them in 2019, anticipating a 2020 wedding. With Covid, Carole was incredibly helpful in getting us two reschedules, including working with all our vendors to find new dates. She was a calm, organized, professional and sympathetic help to us as we stressed over Covid impacts. When our wedding finally arrived in 2021, Carole and Shoshana helped make it perfect. I HIGHLY recommend booking with this amazing team - they know their stuff, and take a huge amount of stress off the bride and groom, and their family. It was such a relief to have a professional in the mix to keep things running smoothly, and troubleshoot last minute obstacles, like our shuttle pickup location being under construction the day before the wedding! We adored working with Events by Rincon, and the food they provided was also delicious. Thank you again, Carole & team!!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-01-13 01:07:24", "review_text": "Rincon Beach Club is refusing to fully or partially refund any deposits even though Santa Barbara / Carpinteria is currently legally prohibiting weddings from taking place. They are incredibly inflexible regarding these circumstances. They offer the option for a later booking date, but are charging $5000-7000 more for a wedding on the later date. Their wedding contract and business policies are unconscionable. I would highly recommend that you avoid Carol and Rincon Beach Club at all costs and go with a more professional, fair wedding vendor."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-11-28 01:54:11", "review_text": "We ordered Thanksgiving Dinner for two and couldn't be happier!
