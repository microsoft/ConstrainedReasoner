The sandwich was fairly small for the price, and the inside of the sandwich was basically empty. Like, if you looked at it from the side, you would think it was just a piece of bread sliced down the middle. Seriously!\n\nTo add insult to injury, it tastes *nothing* like a banh mi. They should just call it something else because there was nothing inside that sandwich that tasted anything remotely like a banh mi does.\n\nThree stars because my friend got a turkey sandwich that they really loved, so just averaging out the stars between the two of us."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-16 18:03:45", "review_text": "This place slaps!

We dropped by one afternoon and were really pleasantly surprised but the quality of the food. Reasonably priced as well, if you factor in the Santa Barbara \"tax\". The beet salad was really fresh and flavorful, and don't forget to throw an egg on top of that fried rice! Did I mention they serve beer? Not that you would ever have one during lunchtime..."}]}
