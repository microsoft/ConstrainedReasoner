{"question": "how do you process the air you breathe before it gets to your lungs?", "passages": "passage 1:Certain trunk and core muscles participate in the breathing process, as well. You might say they do double-duty as both posture and breathing support. These most important of these muscles are: The diaphragm muscle, which is the principal muscle of breathing, contracts in order to take air into the lungs, and it relaxes in order to let it out again. When the diaphragm contracts, it moves down from the bottom of your rib cage towards your abdominal region.\n\npassage 2:The process of breathing involves the exchange of gases, namely, oxygen and carbon dioxide that occurs between you, in particular, the cells of your body, and the outside environment, which is the air. This exchange happens in the lungs. In all, breathing has two components: Ventilation, or movement of oxygen into, and carbon dioxide, out of your lungs. Circulation, or transporting the oxygen taken into the body during ventilation to where it is needed in the body. In terms of how breathing can enhance your therapeutic back exercise program or your successful participation in a pro-active holistic therapy, it's the ventilation component that takes center stage.\n\npassage 3:Increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity drags along with it the lungs, which increases the volume of the lungs, which causes a decrease in the air pressure in the lungs below the atmospheric pressure, forcing air from the atmosphere into the lungs, causing you to inhale.\n\n"}
