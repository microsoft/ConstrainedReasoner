Located in the industrial or \"Funk Zone\" of Santa Barbara, Altamiro's Taqaquira is a great spot to hit while you're doing the Santa Barbara Urban Wine Trail. Nothing goes down better with 10 glasses Santa Barbara wine than 10 tacos. I highly recommend it.\n\nAmbiance: It's a true taquaria and it's priced at $/5 ($1.75/taco), so you shouldn't be expecting much in terms of ambiance. It's run by a husband, wife, son and daughter team and their smiles will fill up your soul.\n\nFood: Tacos are $1.75 each and I had 12 of them: asada, pollo, fish, carnitas, rajas, barbacoa and all pastor (my favorite). They're made right there in front of you and the corn tortillas are incredible. \n\nService: Like I said, the smiles will fill up your soul. \n\nDrinks: They have some unique Mexican beverages, water and Diet Coke. Once again, it's a taqueria so don't expect too much.\n\nEat well my friends,\n - www.JustAGuyThatLovesFood.tumblr.com"}]}
