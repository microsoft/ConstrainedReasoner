The curry was tasty, and definitely had a kick to it. Really liked the green curry had some fresh peas and carrots to add texture and vibrancy to the dish. The chicken was cooked well, and overall really solid! \n\nSecond, ordered a lovely strong Thai Tea that is bold in the tea flavor! Priced at $4.50, this is more expensive compared to the rest of their items, but still cheaper than comparable tea shops. What's unique about this thai tea specifically is you have a bold spice flavor of the spices that make up Thai Tea. \n\nThird, a really good pad thai! For $10.25 on doordash, you get a giant portion, that I personally cannot finish in one sitting. The noodles are moist and flavorful, which is an especially tough feat to pull off. There's shrimp, chicken, peanuts, and no bean sprouts, which is certain to satisfy all the non-vegetarian and non-peanut allergic people! Overall, this is the best restaurant to order on Doordash in Santa Barbara and highly highly recommend!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-20 00:55:42", "review_text": "This is one of the most flavorful Thai places around. Delicious food for an amazing price!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-07-09 03:09:18", "review_text": "I'm not sure what's up with the bad reviews here. Thai Kitchen easily has the most consistent Pad Thai I've ever ordered from any Thai Restaurant, and it tastes damn good; it's the largest portion of Pad Thai I've ever been served, yet also the cheapest Pad Thai I've ever been billed. While other places' Pad Thai often come delivered dry and bland, Thai Kitchen has always delivered moist and flavorful Pad Thai, which is a surprisingly hard feat I've found.\n\nAlso tried their Coconut Water and Thai Tea in the past. Those are good, but nothing special. \n\nIf you like Pad Thai and/or want something good on DoorDash, I guarantee you (Pennie's) Thai Kitchen does not disappoint."}]}
