My husband and I came here yesterday and ordered yang chow fried rice and beef broccoli! Worst Chinese food I've ever had! The fried rice was oily and only had tiny pieces of shrimp and spam! Ugh not worth my money! Then the beef and broccoli was nothing but just broccoli! Soggy broccoli! Can't believe we paid $30 for two nasty items!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2019-06-28 16:32:39", "review_text": "First of all, let's just start with the taste of the food.\n\nThe broth is probably the least flavorful Sichuan mala I have ever eaten.  The food is very expensive for what you get.  $13 for a plate of meat and you literally get 1 oz of razor thin slices.\n\nEven for cheap stuff such as vegetables or noodles that cost $6 and upwards, you would think you would get a decent amount.  No.  You also get a tiny tiny portion.\n\nI ordered Orange Chicken for my son, and each piece of \"chicken\" was LITERALLY 50% potato starch by volume.  Yeah.  Soggy potato starch coating each tiny piece of chicken.  \n\nWith these portion sizes and prices, I feel like I am eating at a Japanese restaurant with slightly more flavor and less fake politeness.\n\nNow let's talk about the other stuff.\n\nThe biggest thing that pissed me off is the \"sauce and appetizer bar\".  The hot pot menu is a huge list of items with small font size.  You check off what you want.  So after ordering the waiter (dressed sloppy in regular street clothes) said, \"Please help yourself to some appetizers\", which makes it sound like they are complimentary.  So I got  some mediocre appetizers.  Then when I get the bill I see I am charged $2 for each person for this, even though my wife and son didn't eat anything from there.\n\nI asked the waiter, \"What is this?  There is no sign about this?\".  He states it's on the menu that I looked at for 10 seconds.  I was already upset at paying $124 for three people (we had to go eat somewhere else because we were still hungry), and I didn't feel like arguing with him.\n\nThe next thing that annoyed me was that before I was even done eating, the waiter hands me the check.  \n\nThe last thing that annoyed me was that my spoken Chinese is mediocre and my written Chinese is even worse.  On the menu, I forgot what it said exactly, but it was some sort of noodle.  My wife wanted the clear glass noodles that are made from green bean starch.  This is the conversation:\n\n\"Excuse me what does this say?\", I asked, pointing to the Chinese characters.\n\"Fen si\", he said.\n\"Oh, the noodles made from beans, right?\"\nHe makes an annoying ugly stink face and shakes his head.\n\"It's made from green beans, right?\"\n\"Yes\"\n\"Yeah, so they are made from beans\"\nHe makes an annoying ugly stink face and shakes his head.\n\nOk..."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2019-06-22 20:43:45", "review_text": "The service was good. People are friendly. But the stir fry dishes are so bad. It's not even about authenticity. The dishes are just simply tasteless. Not going back cuz I like tasty good food. Wouldn't recommend."}]}
