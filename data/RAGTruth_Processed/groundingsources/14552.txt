Server had no clue about the menu or wine (there aren't any local wines and only four choices, owner said they are working on it). Server had to go ask someone else every question we had and could only handle one question at a time. Then he would forget to come back with the answer.\nThe food took over 1.5 hours to be brought out. They said they were busy but the place is small and no one was upstairs. While waiting, I used the restroom and noticed that the kitchen is extremely small. No way they can be efficient in that space.\nWe were entertaining out of town guests (one is a chef in NY) and he wondered about the so called \"award winning chef\" so we looked up Jim Gartman online and they are a joke. The food is not good.\nThey brought out dirty water glasses (one had lipstick on it). For a new place, it still seemed dirty.\nThe management doesn't seem to know what they are doing. They comped our meal since it took so long but even after they realized their mistake, it still took too long. \nNot worth the trouble and many other better options. My chef friend said the place won't last 6 months."}]}
