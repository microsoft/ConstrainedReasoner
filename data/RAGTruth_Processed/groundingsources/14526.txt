I've had soondubu many places, but this one is my favorite. I've had the bulgogi, spicy pork, soondunu, tteokmanduguk, and the tteobokki and I would recommend all of them. \n\nIt's a small mom and pop kind of store with various Asian goods run by a husband and wife. They're always super friendly. The husband runs the front and the wife runs the kitchen. The food reminds me very much of when I would go to my korean friends' houses with that kind of home cooking.\n\nDefinitely food that warms the soul and fills you up, and for a good price too!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 04:58:28", "review_text": "If I could give zero stars I would.  Wanted to order something off the menu. When I walked up to the counter, the cashier - an older Asian man asked me ''what do you want?\"  No pleasant greeting hello of any kind instead he was just extremely curt and lacked any type of of customer service skills.  The woman working the kitchen in the back was just as unpleasant.  I like supporting small local businesses, but the extremely rude staff at this market don't seem to care nor appreciate the business they are getting.  I will NEVER return again and will NEVER waste my time and money here!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-04 04:52:53", "review_text": "Great hole in the wall spot for Korean food! This place is really neat and doubles as both a restraint and a mini Korean market. We looked around the market while our food was being prepared and grabbed some ramen and calpico upon finding boReally enjoyed the bulgolgi and the sundubu. With the lack of Korean food in Santa Barbara, the food really hit home!"}]}
