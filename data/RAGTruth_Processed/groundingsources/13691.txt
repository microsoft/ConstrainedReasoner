Their beans and teas are great, and they have a pretty good selection of bagels, pastries, and other treats that round it off as a really nice place to start your day. The staff is generally friendly, especially the guy who runs the place. Possibly the best part of Java Jones is that their large drinks come with four shots of espresso, which is spectacular for any caffeine junkie. Their prices are reasonable, and although they're renovating the inside now, it sounds like the place is gonna be nice and clean once they're all finished up. Java Jones is highly recommended by this yelper."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2010-06-09 05:43:40", "review_text": "On a warm day there is nothing more satisfying than an Iced Coffee from Java Jones.

The drinks themselves are so-so and the music is ok for the most part. I like this place way more then starbucks but for the best coffee place in IV that has got to be Caje! This place does not compare to Caje.\n\nSo if you feel like changing it up and not going to starbucks and for some crazy reason you don't want to try Caje then I'd recommend this place."}]}
