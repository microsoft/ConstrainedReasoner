Came here with a few friends for the first fine dining experience ever.  Service was wonderful and food was heavenly.  We got the 6 course tasting menu which is just right in variety and amount.  The dessert.. which I still remember was so delicious.. each bite just got better and better.  Toasted filo dough & almonds with a hint of a vanilla custard and fresh strawberries.  So simple, yet so tasty.  I just want to drool when I think about it.  They do set their meals according to season though, so you probably won't get the same courses.  Dare to try this place :)"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2007-06-26 23:06:31", "review_text": "I'm sorry to say, something has changed here, and not for the better.\n\nThe first sign was through the reservation process - don't bother with the website since they can't seem to handle that.\n\nBut, for better or worse, I secured a reservation for eight on a Saturday night, from the day before. Generally, for a good restaurant, that's not a good sign. But I didn't have many choices and I remembered this place being good.\n\nWaiter was nice, restaurant was more than half empty - all the way through the meal. Got a good wine (Blair Fox syrah).\n\nAppetizers, amuse bouche, and sorbet were all fine. Sorbet, even, was good. \n\nEntrees were all - ALL - uniformly overcooked. My scallops were tough, the Ahi was cooked all the way through (so far beyond 'seared' it was pathetic). The Sea Bass was tough. Only the chicken stood up to the cooking - not that it was very good.\n\nNeedless to say, we didn't stay for dessert.\n\nLast time I had been here was about five years before, and it was stellar. Since then, the owner seems to be on a chocolate binge, and maybe he just isn't interested any more. This place is clearly off its game."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2007-03-15 03:04:05", "review_text": "A solid 4 stars.  We came here last week on our anniversary jaunt to Santa Barbara.  After a long day of whale watching and wine tasting, the last thing we ended up being in the mood for was a fancy dinner.  As it turned out, the Sage and Onion was absolutely lovely.  We were served an amouse buche of some kind of yummy thick blended tomato-y soup in a cute little espresso cup.  The truffled white cheddar souffle was a delicious beginning, and surprisingly light and fluffy, it didn't weigh us down but got us excited about the main course.  Our main courses were fantastic.  Mine was steak with scalloped potatoes and rapini that were to die for.  Hers was ahi perfectly seared tuna in a coconut curry lemongrass sauce, and she LOVED it.  The owner said hello, and even gave us some unbelievable cabernet (on the house, it was a 2003 Jordan Cabernet that was the best wine of the trip).  I was so full by dessert that I only ordered sorbet, which was as sweet and refreshing as I'd hoped it would be.  It was a wonderful night, and made our anniversary not just the special night it was, but special AND tasty!  And the waiter was adorable to boot (just look for the tall, dark, and handsome guy)!  We'll happily return next time we're in SB."}]}
