'Young and The Restless' Spoilers: Phyllis Plays A Twisted Game, Tucker Makes Her His New Target?
The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers tease that Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) is stuck in a hard place. She Knows Soaps reports that she helped Tucker McCall (Trevor St. John) hack into Jabot's and Billy Abbott's (Jason Thompson) accounts.
Phyllis would have told Tucker to take a hike, but she really needed the money. She owed her life insurance company $2M after Jeremy Stark (James Hyde) took the payout after faking her death.
Tucker knew this information and leveraged it to get what he wanted from her. He bullied her into it, even after she said no. It's clear that Phyllis is struggling with guilt over helping Tucker.
The Young and the Restless spoilers say that Phyllis reaches out to Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) about Tucker. She tells him Tucker approached her about hacking into Billy and Jabot's account, but she said no. Phyllis also revealed that the present he bought them had a listening device on it. She wasn't willing to help him in his vendetta against the Abbotts.
Soaps Spoilers reports that Jack thanked Phyllis for her honesty and said this would help mend their friendship. He's not ready to forgive her completely, but this is a step in the right direction.
Tucker discovers Phyllis exposed him to the Abbotts. He confronts her and reveals that he has information that could pin the whole thing on her. If that happens, she would go to prison, as it clearly violates her probation.
