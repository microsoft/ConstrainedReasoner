Overall not bad I guess may eat there again. Don't judge the resturaunt completely off my rating because it is very good there is just some things I dont like."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-12-27 04:08:53", "review_text": "Simply the best most delicious chicken and tri tip in town. Great prices too & dependable quality. The char chicken burrito deluxe is my staple although the No. 1 Combo and Fajitas are also favorites. You cannot go wrong here. This is the first place I bring my guests to impress. All smiles."}]}
