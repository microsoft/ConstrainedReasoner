Today we asked specifically again. We want chicken cordon blue. The attendant checked and told us that yes they had it and that certain ones were chicken cordon blue. We asked for two. we cooked  tonight no they are breasts with stuffing. We are not amused. No point in returning here although we have over decades shopped there.  Apparently they haven't a clue what they are producing anymore.."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-07-11 02:40:38", "review_text": "Just wanted to thank Country Catering for making my family gathering on the 4th awesome!

We were so glad that we did. Everything was absolutely delicious. We had tender tri tip, BBQ chicken, beans, broccoli, red potatoes, bread, and cookies. There was something for the entire family to enjoy. Looking forward to coming here again next time we're in the Santa Barbara area."}]}
