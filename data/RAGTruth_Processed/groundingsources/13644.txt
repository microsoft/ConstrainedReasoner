Had crazy Flavor! \n\nThe menu is well rounded. From burgers to Nachos. All the food looked pretty good coming out. My burrito came with Gauc and sour cream. \n\nI asked for the spiciest salsa. She gave all 3 to try. I'd have to say the red/orange Salsa had the best flavor and was the spiciest. Not really over the top. All were good. \n\nWas a beautiful day to sit outside in SB."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-03-06 21:28:05", "review_text": "Crazy Jim's made you makes you feel good crazy.
