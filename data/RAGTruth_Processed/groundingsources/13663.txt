There's like 4 breakfast sandwiches that I've had over the years on my travels and I still think about them to this very day. Add Recipes to the list! The jalape\u00f1o cheddar biscuit breakfast sandwich is just ...*chef's kiss*. Located in a quaint Victorian home, this bakery offers the most tasty home baked goods. I also tried a cinnamon roll that deserves its props. I wish I could have bought one of everything. The owner was working hard all alone; you can tell he is a master at his craft. Already looking forward to my next trip back to SB."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-13 19:38:08", "review_text": "This place is so cute! The bacon cheddar scone with homemade preserve, butter and homemade whipped cream is to die for!!! And it's gluten free. The icing on the cinnamon roll was superb and I'm usually not a cinnamon roll fan. And the fresh squeezed organs juice was very likely the best I have ever had!"}]}
