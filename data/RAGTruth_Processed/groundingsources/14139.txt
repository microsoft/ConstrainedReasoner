We were seated immediately on a Saturday morning at around 10 AM. We loved the decor and old photos of Summerland everywhere! \n\nMy boyfriend got the regular eggs benedict, I got the crab cake eggs benedict, and a cinnamon roll to share. The food was fresh and delicious! I highly recommend to anyone looking for some delicious breakfast and/or lunch!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-12 19:52:14", "review_text": "Came here with a party of 6 and we got seated immediately on a busy Sunday brunch day. Our server was very helpful and polite. The portion sizes are huge and our food came out less than 10 minutes after ordering! We left with full tummies and with plenty of leftovers for later. The food was good quality but wasn't memorable/special besides its serving size but we still enjoyed the experience."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-09 18:01:49", "review_text": "This place is great for families. I love their breakfast. Great place to go. The parking is a little difficult but there's a parking lot across the street. The waffles are my favorite. Yummy"}]}
