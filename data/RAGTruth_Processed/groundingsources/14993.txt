Belcampo is excellent, but the Santa Barbara Public Market screwed up and *lost* this purveyor, so now there is really no reason for my gang to even visit the place anymore."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-08-03 20:55:49", "review_text": "We stopped to get some hot dogs here - really yummy! Grass fed beef $4/dog.  That's food love for me, affordability and quality. It would have been nice to have more topping options other than mustard and ketchup, like relish or banana peppers but would definitely recommend and return to try more of their menu."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-07-29 03:17:10", "review_text": "So I'm only giving 4 stars because I ordered their food for takeout, but their beef is top notch!! The burger with baby lettuce wrap is one of the freshest and juiciest I've tasted. And I'm a burger whore. Their chili is just spicy enough and melts in your mouth. Delish."}]}
