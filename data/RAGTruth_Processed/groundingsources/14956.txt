The day felt completely magical, the staff was incredible, professional, and helpful, and the packages they offer make planning so simple. We worked closely with Christy, the venue/wedding coordinator, and she is absolutely amazing! Super responsive and helpful + clearly lists out options. For anyone looking for a venue in Santa Barbara, I'd 10/10 recommend this place!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-09-26 18:28:37", "review_text": "Came here for lunch with my Aunt who is a member.  We sat on the gorgeous patio.   Excellent options on the menu - something for everyone.  The service is IMPECCABLE.  I got there early and was treated like a valued guest.  I was there on free glass of wine day - the wine was wonderful.  I ordered the French Dip sandwich. My cousin ordered the fresh ahi and my aunt had the soup.  Generous servings.  Again, our waiter and waitress made this such a wonderful afternoon.  Food is really good, but service here and ambiance is five star all day long."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-08-08 19:31:13", "review_text": "The Riviera Mansion was the first wedding venue we looked at and the one we ended up falling for. We loved that it had the option of indoor/outdoor spaces and that we could have the entire venue to ourselves for the day. It was the perfect size to accommodate our 100 guests comfortably. The mansion and the grounds were a beautiful backdrop for all of our photos as well. Breanna was very responsive to all of our questions and was so great to work with. Chef Jamie was also nice enough to help us create a menu that met our needs and was present at our tasting to meet with us. Very pleased with our choice!!"}]}
