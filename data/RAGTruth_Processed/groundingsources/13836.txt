Governor Hobbs' Secret Washington Trip to Talk about the Migrant Crisis
Last week, there was a lot of concern about what was going on with Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs. She suddenly put in a request that her state secretary was the acting governor.
The media was concerned about what happened with Governor Hobbs as news broke that State Secretary Kimberly Yee was the acting governor.
Now that Governor Hobbs is back in office, news broke that she was meeting with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. She discussed with him the migrant situation that Arizona was facing last Thursday, September 28.
She returned that evening to meet with President Joe Biden who was visiting Arizona again.
But while Governor Hobbs was in D.C., she wanted support as U.S. Customs and Border Protection was releasing about 100 to 200 migrants onto the streets of Arizonaaccording to NBC News.
Governor Hobbs said according to The Center Square:
"I shared how frustrated we were that that happened. They're pulling people away from their jobs to deal with the flow of migrants, and we had very little communication about it. He committed to doing better at the communication part, letting us know more ahead of time. We have assurances that they're working to fill positions, and that's what we need."
After Governor Hobbs came into office this year, she wanted to do things differently than her predecessor, Governor Doug Ducey.
With the container wall down, she wanted to rely more on the Biden administration and Congress to get things done to help migrants who crossed the border. One thing she didn’t change from Ducey’s administration was sending migrants out of state.
The only difference was that she sent migrants where they wanted to go. Mayor Hobbs gave migrants a choice.
Do you think Governor Hobbs is doing enough to curb the migrant crisis?
