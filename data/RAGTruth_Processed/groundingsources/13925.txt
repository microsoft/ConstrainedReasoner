The US Attorney's Office in D.C. announced today that a former FBI special agent and a renowned D.C. real estate developer have been sentenced following their involvement in an extensive bribery scheme. The scheme was tied to the unauthorized sharing of confidential data from the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development.
Key Points
Main Defendants
David Paitsel, 42, a former FBI agent from North Carolina
Brian Bailey, 53, a D.C. real estate developer from Upper Marlboro, Maryland
Bailey was convicted of paying significant sums to Dawne Dorsey, a program specialist with the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development. In return, Dorsey provided Bailey with confidential and un-redacted Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA) offer of sale notices.
These TOPA notices are critical, offering D.C. tenants the right to buy their residence if an owner plans to sell. Some of these notices include private details not publicly available.
In another component of the bribery scheme, Bailey paid Paitsel to retrieve the contact information of tenants with TOPA rights. Paitsel had exclusive access to this data due to his position as an FBI agent.
Sentencing
Paitsel received a sentence of 24 months in prison on each count (to run concurrently), 24 months of supervised release, a $100 special assessment, and was ordered to pay a $10,600 forfeiture money judgment.
Bailey was handed a sentence of 48 months in prison on each count (to run concurrently), 24 months of supervised release, a $100 special assessment, and a substantial $250,000 fine.
Other Parties Involved
Dawne Dorsey, 40, had already pleaded guilty to her role in the bribery in June 2019. Her sentencing is set for November 6, 2023.
In a connected case, Frederick Silvers from Washington, D.C., admitted his guilt over bribery and received a 5-month prison sentence for bribes given to Dorsey.
