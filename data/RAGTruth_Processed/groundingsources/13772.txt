The best thing about this spot is that the tortillas are cooked fresh and all your items are cooked when it's ordered. The line can get long but it definitely did not take longer than 40 mins to stand in line and then get or food. Definitely get an order of the adobado, quesadilla w/ chorizo, guacamole, and queso fundido w/ bacon. They all come with 2-3 tortillas so there's more than enough to eat. Skip the tri-tip with onions and the super rica especial. There's also a specials menu for the day and next time I do want to try the pozole."}]}
