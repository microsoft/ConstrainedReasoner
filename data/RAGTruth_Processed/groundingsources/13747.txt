My favorite is the hot Cheetos sprinkled Mac n cheese. Can I say this is the ultimate TREAT YO SELF meal to exist!! I know a lot of people like to go here after going out and needing good comfort food but this place should be acceptable to go to anytime of the day!! I've been dreaming of the Mac n cheese I think it's time I go again!!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-08-16 04:14:21", "review_text": "I would give a 0 star. Not open. Checked in at this place yesterday and today. Called yesterday, the lady on the phone said they will be open Saturday. I am here Saturday. And this spot is closed even though she said she would be open."}]}
