This was Top Notch! I ordered two spicy Falafel sandwiches. (I had one a couple days ago and zipped back for a repeat order. The falafel was actually spicy (vs salty spicy and spicy for wimps). It was crunchy in the outside and tender on the inside. The veg mix was super spot on! The extra hot sauce was freaking amazing and I emptied it! Tahini sauce was as perfect as could be. I might just revisit one more time before we leave SB. Sorry for not sharing pics; I didn't take the time away from my amazing lunch!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-27 21:29:38", "review_text": "Kale falafel burger was absolutely incredible. I've never really actively sought out vegan food, but this has made me start rethinking that. Super great flavor, and so nice to look at!"}]}
