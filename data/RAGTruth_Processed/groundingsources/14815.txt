I wan't sure what type of restaurant this was - - American fare or tapas?  Ordered the basic for dinner - - hamburger with fries.  Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the burger.  It was so salty (and I am a salt maniac).  I really tried to like it but it also didn't taste freshly made, ie. the burger patty had a strange texture, densely formed, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was pulled directly out of the freezer and put on the grill.  The waiter was nice, but it is too bad the food wasn't good.  The interior decor was a dark and dingy and felt like an extension of the biker bar next door.  The patio looked inviting, but it was too cold outside to try it.  Parking was difficult (getting in and out) once a spot was found."}]}
