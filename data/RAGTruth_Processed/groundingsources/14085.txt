I had the beef pho and spring rolls, both of which were fantastic. And as the other reviewers mentioned, they use quality beef. The spring rolls were crispy yet fluffy. Excited to try the bahn mi next time"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 20:47:53", "review_text": "Absolutely delicious! This place is a hidden gem.
