A Kogilicious spicy chicken burrito is one of my favorite foods in the world. But all of the proteins are fantastic- beef, spicy pork, tofu; can't go wrong. Taco, burrito, both are great. And so reasonably priced! Pay cash; you'll get a giant burrito for less than $7, which is unheard of elsewhere in IV. This town desperately needs a proper Korean restaurant, but in the meantime, Kogilicious hits the spot."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-07-22 23:44:51", "review_text": "Three words, Spicy Pork Burrito.\n\nBomb.\n\nBring cash, they charge more if you use a card."}]}
