This little area is very hip and artsy with tons of eateries, shopping but most importantly lots of wineries and breweries.

And even an art installation right. there on State Street!\n\nSome of the best new restaurants in town can even be found here.\n\nIf you're mobile, the Funk Zone is very walkable from a lot of points of interest in town like the beach, the wharf, the Public Market and the Presidio.\n\nParking might not be the best, but like I mentioned before, it's within walking distance of a lot of places you'd be walking to/from anyway."}]}
