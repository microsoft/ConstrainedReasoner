'Young and the Restless' Spoilers: Paul Returns--Social Media Buzz Reveals A Recast Is Coming?
The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers tease that a recast could be on the way for an iconic character on the CBS soap opera. Twitter users speculate that Paul Williams could be returning to the show. However, they suggest that Doug Davidson won't be returning. Instead, the soapy series could be considering recasting the role.
Soaps Spoilers reports that Christine Williams (Lauralee Bell) informs Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) that her marriage is not good. She went to Portugal to spend time with Paul, but they couldn't get on the same page. She cries to Danny that her marriage likely won't survive this, suggesting that she could be ready to move forward and take a chance with him.
But the Y&R fans don't think the show wants to close the door on Paul. They have been discussing if Davidson would consider returning to the soap. He told his Twitter followers he would not return to The Young and the Restless. For him, it has nothing to do with money-- it's a matter of respect.
With Davidson shutting down reprising his iconic role, it leaves Y&R in a difficult spot. They must decide to leave Paul off the canvas or recast the role. Davidson shared with his followers he fully supported the network recasting the role if that's what they want to do.
The Young and the Restless viewers can't agree on the issue. Some encourage Y&R to recast the role, while others find it insulting to recast the role.
