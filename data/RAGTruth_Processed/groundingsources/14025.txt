It was worth every single bite. Usually it comes in 4 quarters with artichokes, olives, ham and mushrooms in each, but I asked if they could mix it up and they were happy to do so. They service was wonderful and I cannot wait to be back. Thank you!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-17 00:01:04", "review_text": "Came to this place for take out the other day. When our food was ready, the lady at the bar called our name. When she was handing us the food, she asked if we had paid for it yet and my boyfriend said yes. (The hostess had us pay when we first ordered it). When we were walking out the door to leave with our food, the lady at the bar shouted at the hostess, and said, \"DiD tHeY pAy YeT???\" Like b******tchhh, we literally JUST told you we paid! Not only are you telling us you don't trust us, you're giving us the worst costumer service ever. My boyfriend even left a hefty tip, which obviously you don't deserve. \n\nSide note- the hostess was very sweet and wonderful. \n\nAnyways, the lady at the bar who handed us the food didn't even warn us about carrying the food up-right. When we got back to our hotel, there was a huge puddle of liquids/sauce in the bag. Basically they didn't even use the correct take out containers which led to everything spilling. The bread was SOAKED in liquids. They were soggy!!! Ew. \n\nMy boyfriend was not happy. We are very disappointed. \n\nSo on top of soggy bread, my dish, the clams with spaghetti, was super dry since all the liquids leaked out of the container. I could've made way better tasting spaghetti at home LOL. \n\nWe paid $60 to get staff that doesn't trust us, soggy bread, and dry spaghetti. \n\nI don't recommend coming here. If you want really delicious pasta, go to California Pasta on State Street. The address is: 811 State St\nSanta Barbara, CA, 93101. Their prices are way better and you won't get soggy bread!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-10-22 16:15:15", "review_text": "Delicious food on a very cute patio. The service was good and the prices are fair once you taste the love in the sauces. Extremely authentic pasta dishes. The fusilli tartufati was recommended by our server and did not disappoint. Exquisite combination of flavors!"}]}
