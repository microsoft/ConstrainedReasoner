How Santa Barbara!\n\nI enjoy spending my money locally. That means Santa Barbara restaurants and Santa Barbara County grown grapes. This approach however can limit exposure to great wineries outside of the area and that's where the California Wine Festival comes in. The summertime, beachside, celebration, does feature some wine from Santa Barbara County but focuses mostly on other producers around the state. If you're looking for Santa Barbara County wines, I would highly suggest attending a Vintners Association event. \n\nThe convenience of this wine festival and its location on the beach is key to is success. Like most, in-town festivals, it can get very busy so I highly recommend buying early entry which gains access at noon rather than 1 PM and allows a little more quiet before the storm time to acquaint yourself with the wineries.\n\nWhile there is food at this event, it's not plentiful, so make sure you eat before you come, giving you a solid base to enjoy your day.\n\nIt's outside and while this time of year we can still see some coastal fog, it's usually bright and sunny. Put on that sunscreen or wear a hat along with cool, cute, wine festival clothing!\n\nMy friends and I gather yearly for this beach side event and I hope you'll make it part of your Santa Barbara experience too."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-06-23 21:40:22", "review_text": "Not sure Nancy T really attended our fest.

This event (Saturday beach tasting) was very expensive for the crowd and length of time. Very little food samples, mostly wine. Would be interested to know if other vendors (not wineries) did well here. We lost $. :-("}]}
