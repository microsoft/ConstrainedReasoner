New Implant: Cancer Cure in 60 Days?
A team of scientists at Rice University has received $45 million in funding to develop a novel implant-based treatment system for cancer. The system aims to improve the outcomes of immunotherapy treatments by continuously monitoring the patient's cancer and adjusting the immunotherapy dose in real-time. The three-inch implant, called HAMMR, will deliver immunotherapy drugs to the patient in a closed-loop system. The chargeable devices will communicate wirelessly, potentially with a smartphone. Researchers believe that the implant will only be needed for short-term use and could potentially eradicate the cancer in as little as 60 days.
Currently, available diagnostic tools provide infrequent and limited snapshots of the dynamic nature of cancer, which hampers the effectiveness of therapies. The new technology, a combination of cancer monitoring and drug administering systems, aims to provide real-time data from the tumor environment to guide more effective and tumor-informed novel therapies.
The first clinical trial will focus on recurrent ovarian cancer, with human trials expected to begin within five years. This technology holds promise for a broad range of peritoneal cancers affecting various organs. The development of the HAMMR implant-based treatment system is a significant breakthrough in the field of cancer treatment. The ability to continuously monitor the patient's cancer and adjust the immunotherapy dose in real-time has the potential to provide more effective and personalized treatments. By delivering immunotherapy drugs in a closed-loop system, the HAMMR implant ensures precise and targeted drug administration, which could lead to improved outcomes for patients.
The current limitations of available diagnostic tools, which only provide infrequent and limited snapshots of the dynamic nature of cancer, hinder the effectiveness of therapies. With the HAMMR implant, real-time data from the tumor environment will guide the administration of novel therapies, thereby increasing their effectiveness. The first clinical trial focusing on recurrent ovarian cancer is an exciting step toward demonstrating the efficacy of this technology. If successful, the HAMMR implant holds promise for treating a broad range of peritoneal cancers affecting different organs, offering hope for numerous patients in need of more tailored and efficient treatments.
