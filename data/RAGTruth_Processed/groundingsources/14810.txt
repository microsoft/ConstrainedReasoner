When I first came here I assumed it was just a small cafe with a few tables inside, instead what I found was a lovely boutique and cafe with a huge garden back patio! Simply fantastic.\n\nThe food is typical morning bakery items and some hot dishes. I like to stick with a bagel or avocado toast. They also have breakfast burritos and sandwiches. I thought those were just okay but otherwise any bakery food has been great. A huge assortment of teas and coffees. Easy to please any guest.\n\nFrom my experience the service has always been great and friendly. You order at the counter and any food items they'll bring to your table. I feel like the service is super quick here, I've never had to wait long for food and the outside is so spacious that even when they get busy they can fit many.\n\nMy other favorite thing about this spot is their small store/boutique on the inside. They always have the cutest little dishtowels! There the secret is out. Love all of the small home and garden goods. A great little treat to be able to shop while brunching."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-10-21 19:43:17", "review_text": "I don't understand the hype. Most of their sandwiches/food items are average. Their California ciabatta super disappoints. Something about they way they make the egg or the type of cheese they use. The bread is not a good choice for it either. Plus, they are never very friendly and I've been there probably 5-10 times now."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-20 22:43:48", "review_text": "The very best sandwiches we've ever had!!!!!\nA beautiful garden to eat your lunch in also \nJust can't say enough about this hidden gem. \nFound it accidentally while looking for the old Santa Claus lane I remembered as a child which is no longer there. \nYou won't be disappointed with these delicious freshly made foods"}]}
