There's a location downtown that's cheap and fast I work in Goleta so I decided to google \"Italian food, Goleta\" and Sorriso Italiano popped up.  A co worker and I decided to give it a go, and we were more than pleasantly surprised.  The alfredo sauce was impressive for such a quick call in order.  Highly recommend it!"}]}
