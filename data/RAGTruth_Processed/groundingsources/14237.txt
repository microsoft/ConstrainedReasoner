You can tell the pork cutlet is so aged and frozen by looking at the texture and the taste. If I were Gordon Ramsay, I will definitely put that cook under every single pressure test. Doubt whether is it a new Chinese money laundry business."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-05-21 00:18:29", "review_text": "Considering the lack of Taiwanese food in the Santa Barbara area, this place is a godsend if you live here and miss food from Taiwan. If you're comparing to Taiwanese food in the bay area or LA though, this is probably just a 3-star place. \n\nI ordered the braised pork over rice bento box, which came with some fatty pieces of pork on white rice, half a soy sauce egg, sauteed cabbage, corn and ham, kimchi, and a small sausage (though not the Taiwanese sausage I was expecting). It was alright. It tasted like a lot of it was reheated in a microwave. The egg rolls were pretty standard, nothing to write home about, and the Szechuan spicy wings had a good kick to it but presentation could have used some work."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-05-11 23:09:43", "review_text": "Thought we would try something new. This place did not disappoint. The popcorn chicken and bento box were out of this world. Too much food for two people...we brought food home. Popcorn chicken is fried and served with a curry mustard sauce (crazy good). The bento box had excellent kimchi to go with the chicken over rice...also corn, egg and seaweed salad. They serve beer. The decor is bland with only the largest tv I've seen in my life. Bathroom clean was a bonus. Nice staff though you order at the counter and they serve you. Really impressed."}]}
