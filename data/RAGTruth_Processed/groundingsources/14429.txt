{"question": "what is the difference between method overriding vs overloading", "passages": "passage 1:In method Overloading, two or more methods shares the same name in the same class but having different signature while in method overriding, method of parent class is re-defined in the inherited class having same signature.\n\npassage 2:Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism. Method overriding is the example of run time polymorphism. In java, method overloading can't be performed by changing return type of the method only. Return type can be same or different in method overloading.\n\npassage 3:There are many differences between method overloading and method overriding in java. No. Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program. Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of the method that is already provided by its super class.\n\n"}
