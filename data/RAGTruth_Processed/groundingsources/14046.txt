EVER had... they are not even entirely vegan which is the shocker- as most non vegan places believe a plate full of vegetables is what us vegans eat.. this place was truly imaginative, and provided me with a perfect four course meal..  yes, i, Shirley, said perfect... a rare thing indeed.\ni really wanted to have this place cater my wedding, the second i realized every bite i had was magical, i was truly obsessed with the idea of them catering my wedding- and now that i'm planning it... they're gone. so sad.\n\nwish places like this stayed open.... this and pure luck in silverlake...
