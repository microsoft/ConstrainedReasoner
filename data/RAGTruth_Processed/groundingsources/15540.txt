{"question": "history of the word gemini", "passages": "passage 1:The word \u201cGemini\u201d is a Latin word for twins and it is one of the constellations that actually look like its name would suggest. The first known reference of the Gemini constellation was in Aristotle\u2019s Meteorologica, over 300 years BC. He mentions that he observed an occulting a star in Gemini and speaks of observing Jupiter in conjunction with it.\n\npassage 2:Gemini History. The History of Gemini. As other signs in the zodiac, Gemini is not in the same position as the constellation of Gemini. In the zodiac, it follows Taurus and takes the third 30 degrees of the zodiacal circle. Gemini is a mutable sign that is preceding the summer, and as such, it announces change while ruling the time of year when Taurus spring has ended, and life on Earth is about to change.\n\npassage 3:Gemini Mythology The Story Behind the Gemini Zodiac Sign. The origins of some constellation myths are heavily debated. Gemini mythology, luckily, is pretty straightforward. By all accounts, the twins represented in Gemini mythology are Castor and Pollux of Greek mythology. They share the same mother, Leda (Greek mythology), but have different fathers. Castor's father is Tyndarus, the King of Sparta, and Leda's husband.\n\n"}
