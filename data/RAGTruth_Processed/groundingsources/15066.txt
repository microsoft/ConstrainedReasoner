But with the long break in our work due to Covid, I got a great refresher in just how awesome they are yesterday. I can't say enough about how amazing the bartenders and staffers that worked my Carpinteria event were! Incredibly hard workers, flexible, pleasant, going out of their way, you name it, they did it. Thanks to Jude who runs the show for tying it all together.\n\nBest- Toby the SB Wedding Coordinator"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-08-14 13:29:16", "review_text": "Jude is so knowledgeable in his industry! He knows all the other vendors in Santa Barbara area, he knows all the venues, and he gives great advice! I highly recommend choosing him in general, but especially if you are having a Santa Barbara wedding because it is ideal to hire a wedding planner who is familiar with your venue. He will know how much space there is for things and he will be realistic with you about what will/will not work. Although he is technically a partial service wedding planner, he will do some full-service things for you because he goes above-and-beyond to make sure his brides are happy. He even fought for a refund for us from a vendor that we ended up needing a refund from. It was great that he had a lot of \"pull\" with that vendor when they were trying to be difficult. I highly recommend hiring Jude as your wedding planner!"}]}
