{"question": "how to grill beef back ribs on a gas grill", "passages": "passage 1:Place beef ribs on the grill (bone side down) away from the coals and cook with indirect heat (approximately 275\u02daF) for 1\u00bd hours, or until internal temperature of beef reaches 160\u02daF. Remove ribs from grill and place them in the center of a doubled sheet of aluminum foil with meat side facing down. Pour stock mixture over ribs and wrap tight in foil, trapping juice inside. Return the foil pack to the grill for 1 hour, or until internal temperature of beef reaches 200\u02daF. Remove foil package from grill and let beef rest in the foil for 15 minutes before removing. Slice each rib to the bone at scored cuts. Reserve some au jus to drizzle over beef or to season side dishes, such as mashed potatoes. The hickory adds just the right amount of smoke to the already bold beef rib.\n\npassage 2:1 Cook 2\u00bd to 3 hours or until tender and meat has shrunk back from the ends of the bone by about \u00bd inch.  About 15 minutes before ribs are done, turn the heat up to medium. Place the ribs meat-side down over the fire and cook for a couple minutes to crisp them up and render any remaining fat. Generously brush with sauce. Return the ribs meat-side up to the indirect side of the grill and brush on more sauce.\n\npassage 3:1 Preheat a gas grill for high heat, or arrange charcoal briquettes on one side of the barbeque. Lightly oil the grate.  In a small jar, combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Close the lid, and shake to mix.\n\n"}
