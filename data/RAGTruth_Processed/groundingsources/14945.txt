Their food preparation is first rate.  Quality of food is also first rate.  What makes them over the top is how easy it is.  Just a call to Justen.  Always on time, the food is hot, delicious, and correct to the order.  Never had one of their bagels, yet, however!  We use them all the time for catering.  Keep doing what you're doing!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-12 21:24:46", "review_text": "I ordered a milpas melt and I was very disappointed. It looks like they just threw it in there.. they didn't bother closing the lid either so the other bagel fell out. the staff was very unorganized. There was a young lady by the name of Celeste who was very rude to other employees and in front of the customers which is not professional at all. Jacks used to be my favorite restaurant when I was younger it was great, the food and customer but now it's not the same and it's disappointing."}]}
