I want a restaurant to succeed here, but where is the branding? The name Sublime comes with no info as to what kind of food is served. There is no identity established and no web presence. Even if the sign said, in big letters, \"Sublime: Healthy California Cuisine\" it would help a lot. To the owner: this is very basic business 101. You can't open a restaurant in 2015 without a website and a name that hints to the consumer what type of food you are serving!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-06-25 14:18:40", "review_text": "Awesome coffee! Nice cafe in the area, looks like the menu is changing since they opened.

They could not answer a single question about anything without having to run to the back to ask someone else.  \n\nFood - decent enough.  I enjoyed the sage chicken.  My friend had the $40 steak dish (which I see is no longer on the menu) and the steak was juicy and delicious.  Congrats!  You made a yummy!  However, they use Miracle Whip in their deviled eggs.  Rewind....whuuuut??  Ew and moving on.  I looked forward to trying their tiramisu and after the server hyped it up, he told us it was not ready for the eating and wouldn't be until the next day.  Tiramisu tease!\n\nA place that charges $40 for a dish should NEVER have Miracle Whip on the premises!!!  Where is your pride?!  Ohhh yeah, it's at the bottom of that jar of Miracle Whip.  It's miracle if they stay open, and it certainly won't be attributed to my returning patronage."}]}
