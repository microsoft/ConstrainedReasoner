What remains arrives without salad or fries or even a tidbit of  garnish. Your food comes on a metal tray without napkins or eating tools. If you order a hamburger, expect it to come under a super greasy bun. \n\nThe patio is no longer covered so you'll be sitting in direct sunlight. It feels like this place is having an extended identity crisis. \n\nDamn if the funk zone doesn't need some decent dependable lunch places. This establishment is really missing out on an easy opportunity here. Great location, nice facility, but no thought or care in what they're serving up or in what they want to be."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2016-01-10 02:25:11", "review_text": "Horrible service.

They've all but eliminated all the great food they served. They've now removed all but 2 TVs. Very disappointing business choices. I walked in this past weekend to catch a nationally televised hockey game, something I've done dozens of times here in the past. The bartender acknowledges us but is so busy covering the entire restaurant that he didn't get to us for nearly 10 minutes. We had to walk out and find a more suitable place to catch the game. Can't say I'll have a desire to go back. This town was already lacking decent sports bars with a good beer selection."}]}
