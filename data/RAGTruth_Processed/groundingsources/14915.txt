We made reservations which was helpful. We ordered the Kale  salad with Salmon and the Grilled chicken with chilies. The salmon was moist and the salad dressing had some lemon in it which gave the salad a great flavor. The grilled chicken was moist and flavorful. We have been to the Jane restaurant in Goleta and in Santa Barbara many times and the food and service are always great."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-24 20:00:08", "review_text": "I've been to both locations in Santa Barbara, and have thoroughly enjoyed both. I've only gotten the fettuccine and chicken, and every time I go I'm always tempted to try something new but have a hard time straying from a delicious meal. Atmosphere is great and the service is also great. I also love the pasilla chiles appetizer and the onion rings, and both are great starters for a meal."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-07 16:55:50", "review_text": "We love Jane, both locations. Excellent starters, salads, burgers, mains, drinks and dessert. Besides the delicious menu, we also enjoy the great service. From greetings from the front to exceptional service, we are always pleased. Never ever had a bad meal or experience there. They don't always have it, but when they do try a soft serve Ice Cream Sunday. That's my daughter's favorite. Jane's coconut cake is mine!"}]}
