Especially since I really enjoyed visiting the one in carpinteria. However, the food is mediocre. I got an order of the French toast and it tasted bland and a little cold. The tables were really sticky, the waitress acknowledged the tables were sticky but did not offer to wipe it down, instead we just got \"oh wow the table is sticky\" remark. The cashier in the front was very nice though. I did however, love the art work and interior of this place. The coffee was also really good! And the prices are affordable."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2018-05-22 16:58:40", "review_text": "Not a good place to stop for morning beverage, out of chai for at least two weeks, out of both coconut and almond milk! Seems to be a change in morning staff?"}]}
