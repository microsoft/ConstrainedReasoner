Dollar General Sued for Firing Pregnant Worker
A Dollar General worker in Georgia was reportedly fired after informing her store manager of her pregnancy, leading to a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against the discount chain. Dollar General has agreed to pay $42,500 to settle the suit. According to the EEOC, the worker was terminated immediately after revealing her pregnancy in September 2020. When the worker expressed her desire to return to work, her manager questioned the safety of her working while pregnant. Despite assuring her manager that she could work, she was not allowed to return and received a separation notice citing "health reasons" as the cause of termination.
The EEOC emphasizes that pregnancy should not be a reason for employers to assume an employee cannot work, and it aims to address and prevent such detrimental stereotypes. Dollar General has yet to respond to requests for comment. Pregnancy discrimination is illegal under federal law, and the EEOC enforces protections for pregnant employees through three federal laws, including the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. Pregnancy discrimination in the workplace is not only morally wrong but also illegal. The case involving a Dollar General worker in Georgia highlights the importance of protecting the rights of pregnant employees. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has filed a lawsuit against Dollar General after the employee was fired following the disclosure of her pregnancy.
The worker's termination immediately after revealing her pregnancy, and the subsequent doubts raised by her manager regarding her ability to work while pregnant, demonstrate a clear violation of federal laws protecting pregnant employees from discrimination. The EEOC's involvement and the $42,500 settlement are significant steps toward addressing and preventing detrimental stereotypes surrounding pregnancy in the workplace. It is crucial for employers to understand that pregnancy should never be a reason to assume that an employee cannot fulfill their job responsibilities. By enforcing protections for pregnant workers, such as those provided by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, the EEOC aims to ensure equal treatment and fair opportunities for all employees, regardless of their pregnancy status.
