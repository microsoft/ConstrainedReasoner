Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's "Low Blows" on royals have drawn criticism from King Charles
The Royal Family and all of its fans are still displeased with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, but according to a royal expert, King Charles is in a better position and shouldn't use the Sussexes' purported "low blow" assaults against him.
Speaking to GBN News, Dr. Ed Owens asserts that the Sussexes must continue in a "dignified manner," since that is what the king is doing.
The Sussexes have not made a public statement on the monarch since they spoke with Oprah Winfrey a few years ago.
"All they can do is carry on in a dignified manner as possible," he stated. "If the Royal Family wants to come to light with any new story, this might prove that Harry and Meghan's complaints about the Royal Family were true."
According to Dr. Owens, Prince Harry poses a greater threat to the public's perception of the Royal family than Meghan Markle.
Dr. Owens concedes that the younger Prince's popularity with Spare did more harm to the brand than any "tell all" interviews the couple has done or would do going forward.
"Harry said that there were members of the family that were essentially briefing against him," he said.
The last members of the House of Windsor do not wish for those rumors to come to pass by acting in a way that would lead to their discovery.
"The Royal Family must not deign to the low blow strategy adopted by Harry and Meghan," he said.
According to a recent Time Magazine poll, younger people are almost calling for a more republican movement as the popularity of the British monarchy is eroding.
Even though just 29% of all Britons think the monarchy is "very important," Dr. Owens thinks that continuing with the traditional approach will be well-received by younger Britons.
"They've got to maintain a distance at a dignified silence, however difficult that might be," he stated.
