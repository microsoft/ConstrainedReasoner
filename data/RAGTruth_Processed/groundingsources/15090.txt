Watched the bartender walk from the women's bathroom (identifying as a male) without even stopping to wash his hands whatsoever --to RETURNING TO SERVE DRINKS. Actually horrifying given the current COVID crisis. Clearly no consideration of the very real health crisis. Avoid. This is very concerning."}]}
