I came here on a Monday night and there was no wait time. \n\nI ordered a medium bowl which was VERY filling! They are extremely generous with the portion size and especially the protein scoops (which most poke places tend to skimp out on). The fish and all the toppings were fresh and overall it was really delicious. \n\nChoppa is more expensive when compared to other poke places; however, the price is justified by the fresh fish and generous portions! Will definitely come again(:"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 05:56:37", "review_text": "WORST experience ever. If you wish to be humiliated, do check them out.\n \nOrdered their poke bowl in english and dined in with my husband. Thinking we could not understand mandarin, we later heard one of the female employees speaking to her colleagues pretty loudly about us and mentioning how disgusting we were as customers. In her exact words \"Those two people who just came in, one male and female, having a bowl of poke bowl. Don't you think they are very disgusting?\"  \n\nI was extremely astonished to hear what she had said given that we did absolutely no wrong. And still find it puzzling why she would have said that. While we did not confront about the issue, we later walked over and spoke in mandarin, to let her know we understood mandarin too.  I guess it's just having a certain amount of basic respect and EQ to not badmouth about your customers so loudly. I hope the boss of this outlet is reading this and would educate your staff about customer service.  \n\nI've never felt so much humiliation while dining."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-18 02:17:03", "review_text": "Located next to Kyle's Kitchen across from the Costco Center, this place offers up delicious poke bowls with all the fixings. I get the medium, which comes with 3 scoops of protein. For me, that means 2 scoops of fresh ahi and 1 of spicy tuna. Like all poke bowl spots, be careful if you order any mayo sauce options as you will quickly be asking for poke with your mayo. I like some ponzu sauce and a touch of wasabi mayo to go along with almost all the toppings + extra ginger. It's always fast and mostly polite service. \n\nI do feel compelled to dock a star for the prices. A medium will run you $20 with tax. Considering it's delicious and healthy, I'll splurge every now and again, but I'm just not sure how long it can survive. So far so good and I'm glad it's there. Definitely worth checking out."}]}
