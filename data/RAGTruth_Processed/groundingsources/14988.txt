Plenty of seating and has everything that you need, but not much more than that.  There's a nice patio outside to sit at.  The drinks are kind of a hit or miss, depending on who makes them.  Sometimes I admit that it kind of smells funky and some of the fabric furniture have food stains and crumbs and smells odd.  But otherwise, the people here are chill and the baristas are really nice.  You can pretty much stay here as long as you like without being bothered unless it gets to crowded (which I have yet to see, however I hear that it does during the school year and I've only been here during the summer).\n\nGreat location.  Yay for free wi-fi.  And so far outlets haven't really been a problem.  Outlet strips on every wall.  Coffee to keep you awake.  Food close-by.  Like I said, everything that you need."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2009-08-12 06:31:58", "review_text": "Comfy little non-chain that makes good coffee. \n\nWhat I like best about this place is that it feels very welcoming--you actually want to stay and have a conversation with friends, or grab a book (they totally have a borrow-lend bookshelf, too!) \n\nHas both indoor and outdoor seating, isn't overpriced and takes debit cards with no required minimum. \n\nThe only thing that weirds me out is there's no place for tip on the receipt and I never carry cash. So that makes me feel like a non-tipping jerkface."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2009-07-09 04:33:19", "review_text": "We were looking for a great coffee spot near UCSB and found Mojo on Yelp. \n\nI'm not sure how it got such great reviews. The coffee and latte we had were OK but nothing to rave about. The cinnamon bun was stale (and the server did not offer to heat it). The decor was fine."}]}
