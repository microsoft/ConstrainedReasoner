The blonde girl thought this was the most prudent question to ask this Gaucho when I went inside to buy an energy drink. First and last time I buy anything here.

Inside seating is usually full but outside seating is fine. What I really liked was the breakfast burrito, I'll have to try more of their food menu to make a complete judgement but the burrito was pretty good."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2019-05-22 16:39:11", "review_text": "Slow slow slow!!  And they often get my order wrong.  But, they have a monopoly on this side of campus, and have no incentive to perform."}]}
