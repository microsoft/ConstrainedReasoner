Service was great. The meat lovers flatbread was amazing, but I wasn't a big fan of the prosciutto flatbread.  The kids pasta was decent but it tasted very spicy for some reason. The mojito was decent, too. Will probably come back at some point!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-10-21 03:56:27", "review_text": "Corner Tap is a welcome addition to the Mesa.  Staff are friendly and responsive. Should have ordered beer. Wine prices way too high. Paid $16 tonight for glass of Qupe Chardonnay which is pedestrian at best. Cauliflower hot and tasty. Flat bread cold and cheese not toasted. If you go, avoid wine and order one dish at a time!"}]}
