Pizza looks amazing.... I haven't bitten into a slice just yet. I've been waiting over an hour for plates, forks ect... I'm staying in a very nice hotel after a long day and I called Gina's two minutes later to say.. You forgot the utensils I ordered a salad. What poor customer service!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-01-13 18:11:58", "review_text": "Gina's has really good hearty Italian entrees & pizza at very reasonable prices.\nWhen I am not in town visiting elderly relatives & I have food delivered from here to them.

My wife ordered a pizza with pesto and artichoke heart on one half and Hawaiian on the other.  We carried the order out.  It was okay--the crust was a bit thick for me--I've tasted better.  I would try other items on the menu if we visit again.  We're just passing through."}]}
