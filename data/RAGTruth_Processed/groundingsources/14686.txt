I called 9 times and never got an answer. I FINALLY got through and they said my pizza was made within 30 seconds of my online order so they couldn't remove the pepperonis. Finally, the manager answered and said he would give me 4 extra garlic sauces to make up for the mistake. And then the pizza was delivered WITHOUT 4 extra garlic sauces..... can you believe that? Called back to explain that I was promised extra garlic sauce and didn't receive it.. apparently it was another \"mistake\"......... long story short... I did NOT enjoy my papa john's experience."}]}
