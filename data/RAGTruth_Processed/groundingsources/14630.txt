Check out this spot if you havent"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-04-15 12:22:25", "review_text": "Nice little hole-in-the-wall spot. \n\nIf you're searching for Elsie's, you'll likely drive right past it. It's not really advertised from the street and I believe that this is intentional. While only a mere block or so from the best of downtown, its location is far enough off the beaten path that lends to the feeling of a speakeasy.\n\nElsie's is in a unique old building sectioned off into a few rooms. You'll find old couches (the kind you'll absolutely sink into), vibrant wall colors, and eclectic wall art. It's like a grunge-style garage from the '90s and truly brings me back to that era. There's also a great, large back patio along with a small front parklet area for Covid. There are two bathrooms which have seen far better days, but their dirtiness ties right into the old, endearing vibe of the place as a whole. \n\nElsie's is beer and wine only - and cash only, although there's an ATM in front. I don't typically carry cash so must remember this fact when I come here. You'll find a very unique assortment of beers and I've tried a few good ones. I'd also tried their soju-based Bloody Mary once and it wasn't bad. \n\nWhy three stars? Service can be a hit or a miss. I was here last night and the bartender was awesome. He was able to recommend some good beers for us and even provided a shot glass with a sample to try. Haven't always been this lucky, though. I was here about a year and a half ago (late 2019) and the female bartender working (dark hair, she's there often) was surly to the point that I'd decided not to come back in until just yesterday. I don't know if she's still here but I'd avoid at all costs if she is. Otherwise, a nice, comfortable local watering hole."}]}
