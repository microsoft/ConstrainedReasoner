{"question": "smell in a house how to get rid of", "passages": "passage 1:When these critters grow in number, they can generate a pretty strong odor. They can even spread to other regions of your home, which strengthens the musty scent. (If this is the problem, learn how to fix drain pipe leaks) Damp Wood \u2013 Wood, when left damp and uncleaned, gradually develops a strong musty scent. The culprits are molds and mildew, which thrive in organic materials.\n\npassage 2:Clean your home thoroughly using a strong cleaning solution and cleaning rags. Pay attention to places you don't normally clean, such as inside cabinets, under sinks and along window sills. Wipe down the walls, baseboards, doors and counter tops with a 1 to 10 solution of bleach and water. Air out each room by opening the windows. Choose a nice day with a breeze to help move air throughout your home. Airing out the rooms will help release odors in curtains, carpets and furniture. Keep the windows open for at least an hour, or longer for particularly heavy odors.\n\npassage 3:While this won't get rid of the smell, it'll help. Also, set bowls of white vinegar around your home, at least one per room (depending on the room size). Just make sure small children and pets are safe. If you have an air purifier or can borrow one or two from friends, this is a great way to decrease smoke smell. It takes time for the air to become clean, so I suggest keeping the purifier in the room you use the most. In the day, that might be the kitchen or home office. At night, the bedroom.\n\n"}
