But they've changed their fries & personally it doesn't taste as good as before :( but they're still good! I would still recommend for the gaucho tradition. They've even change containers & definitely something different about the fries themselves. Management looks a bit tough on the cooks as well so I felt bad for the cooks while they were preparing orders getting yelled at by their manager/supervisor. Overall they're not the same but they're okay!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-17 05:53:44", "review_text": "I like this place. Open late but sometimes takes a long time.

I went to school here in 2015 and was here almost everyday. Buffalo chicken cheese fries is always my go to. I work down the street now and it's such a terrible experience every time I've go. I found out that it's now newly owned and operated (which explains my terrible experience/service). The Buffalo fries don't even taste the same and it breaks my heart. They must've changed the recipe or something cause dear God, those taste disgusting. I've ordered fries only to take two bites out of it because of how bad they are. I hope this lady gets this business together, it's tearing down a beautiful culture that was built in IV. BRING BACK ORIGINAL BUFFALO CHICKEN CHEESE FRIES"}]}
