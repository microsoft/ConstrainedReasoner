A mother-of-four from Florida,  disappears mysteriously after leaving Walmart shift in 2010
Marie Chantal Delly, a mother-of-four from Florida, vanished under mysterious circumstances after concluding her cashier shift at a Naples Walmart on May 17, 2010.
According to details provided by Collier County Sheriff’s Detective Scott Peterson, Delly was dropped off at the Walmart by her husband, Mathnauld Dareus, around 8:30 a.m. She clocked out around 4:30 p.m., but her subsequent movements remain shrouded in mystery. "Marie had sought a day-off for the following day, intending to attend her child’s doctor appointment. However, she never turned up for that appointment,” Detective Peterson reported.
The alarm was raised on May 19 when Delly failed to report for her scheduled shift. Walmart subsequently reached out to her husband, who then reported her as missing to the sheriff’s office.
Notably, Detective Peterson mentioned that Delly had previously taken short breaks when she faced “marital difficulties,” often not informing her husband of her whereabouts. But she always kept her family and children in the loop — a practice she deviated from this time.
A key piece of evidence has emerged in the form of Walmart’s security footage. The footage captured a silver vehicle at the store during Delly’s exit time, which was later spotted at an area toll booth. Significantly, Dareus, Delly’s husband, has not been ruled out as a person of interest due to "inconsistencies between his account and the findings of our investigation."
Since her mysterious disappearance, Delly has neither accessed her bank nor her social media accounts. Further, there's no indication of her contacting friends or family or leaving the country. Importantly, Detective Peterson highlighted that Delly is an immigrant from Haiti.
In a startling twist, the Naples Daily News reported that Dareus moved to Orlando shortly after Marie’s disappearance. The same publication also highlighted that Dareus was convicted in 2015 for first-degree murder with a firearm, linked to the fatal shooting of Hyatt Regency employee Cedilien Forestal in Orlando.
