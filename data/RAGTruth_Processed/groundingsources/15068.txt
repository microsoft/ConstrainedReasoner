We received our food and then the bar tender forgot about our drinks. She then proceeded to make multiple others before making hours. This also happened to me last time I came! I never write reviews but honestly it was very unpleasant. Also, there happy hour time is wrong on the menus...extra frustrating!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-05 18:52:59", "review_text": "For the weekend evening, they were not busy, but after getting seated our drinks order was taken after 10 min. There were only 2 people managing the bar and service. Our food arrived 40+ minutes after placing it. We ordered more drinks which they forgot about so I had to go in and add the request again. Both me and my husband had to personally go in several times to get what we needed. My husband also got 2nd mule which didn't taste like a mule. Bar tender said she accidentally gave the wrong drink so he got a new glass which was filled with ice and the drink was little bit over half full. Food wise, it was good except for chicken shawarma. Chickpea patty from chickpea burger was definitely very good. I cant imagine hoe their service will be when they're actually busy, so we will not be taking chance in the future.\nFor the good food and set up they have, the can go long way with good service."}]}
