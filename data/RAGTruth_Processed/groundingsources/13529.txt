'The Bold and the Beautiful' Spoiler About John McCook's Three-Year Contract  Is A Lie
The Bold and the Beautiful (B&B) spoilers revealed in September that John McCook, the actor who plays Eric Forrester, signed a nearly record-breaking three-year contract. The news relieved the fans as Eric seemed to be going through a severe health crisis.
The truth is no one knows McCook's contract status. The report came from Celeb Dirty Laundry. TV Insider, Daytime Confidential, and numerous other blogs sourced CDL reporting McCook's contract deal.
On Monday, October 30, I (the writer who wrote the CDL article under the name Marcy Cohen) came clean about the article. The article was based on McCook's last contract with The Bold and the Beautiful in 2017.
The owner of CDL has a history of encouraging his writers to blatantly lie and disguise those fabrications as spoilers to get page views. The lie in the article about McCook was weighing heavily on me, so I decided to come clean.
It's possible that John McCook signed another contract with The Bold and the Beautiful. It's doubtful he signed a three-year deal, considering the soap opera is only renewed one-to-two years at a time.
I cannot let the B&B fans believe that Eric will definitely pull through his illness because of a contract that probably was never signed.
As difficult as it was for me to come clean about this situation, it was necessary. Not only am I a soap writer, but I am also a bonafide soap viewer. I don't want anyone believing in fake spoilers, especially when Eric Forrester could end up dying in the coming weeks.
