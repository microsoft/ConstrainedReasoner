Texas Police Could Arrest Illegal Immigrants In New Bill
Last Thursday, the House of Representatives passed a crucial bill to stop illegal immigrants from staying in Texas. The bill would allow police to arrest illegal immigrants and send them back to Mexico.
According to KERA News, House Bill 4 passed 83 to 63 after much disagreement. The House vote was around 4 a.m. on Thursday, October 26.
Democrats tried to derail the bill, but the House of Representatives eventually passed the bill.
State Representative Cody Harris, R-Palestine tried to limit the number of amendments representatives could make, but the bill was approved.
State Representative Armando Walle, D-Houston warned Harris about his actions.
Walle said according to KERA News:
“Y’all don’t understand the s**t that y’all do. It hurts our community, it hurts us personally.”
Democrats and immigrant rights groups tried to limit the bill's passage.
HB 4, sponsored by state Rep. David Spiller, R-Jacksboro, would create a new state crime for illegally entering Texas from Mexico, authorize state police to arrest violators, and allow officers to return migrants to a port of entry and order them to return to Mexico.
Representative Spiller said according to The New York Post:
“Our cries for help in the enforcement of existing federal immigration laws have been ignored by President Biden. We have had enough.”
Spiller also said according to the Texas Tribune:
“There is nothing unfair about ordering someone back from where they came if they arrived here illegally.”
House Bill 4 is now headed to the Senate for approval.
The bill could come under scrutiny from the Biden administration. Spiller said:
“There is nothing unfair about ordering someone back from where they came if they arrived here illegally.”
Another immigration bill was recently declared legal after two years as Governor Greg Abbott’s executive order was declared lawful mentioned here.
