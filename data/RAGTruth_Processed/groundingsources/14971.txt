It's a fish market & restaurant.  I ordered battered fish sandwich and my husband ordered salmon poke bowl.  Salmon poke bowl had too much creamy sauce mixed with salmon but it tasted good.  My sandwich was very good.  I asked for the tarter sauce on the side (simply because I don't like to have too much sauce on it) and she served everything (but fish) on the side.  If I live near by, I would love to buy some fresh fish here!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-16 01:10:19", "review_text": "Great food, great service!

It's got a welcoming, clean look, is only one block from State, and has its own parking lot. Today wasn't going to be the day either, but when we found that the sushi spot we wanted to hit was closed, we pivoted to Kanaloa. I'm here to tell you that it was a great choice.\n\nI had the grilled fish sandwich and fresh chips. My wife and daughter got poke bowls. It was all extremely fresh and delicious. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. In addition, the service was very friendly and helpful, ordering was a breeze, there was plenty of seating, and the food came out quickly and perfectly done. I'm not sure it's always this awesome, but I simply don't care. I will be back."}]}
