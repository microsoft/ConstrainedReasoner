My husband only eats rice dishes and I love a little bit of both sushi and Japanese homey dishes. In most places in town, they are only good at one or the other. This place is great at both. The family feel of this restaurant is great. They were all so friendly and we felt really welcomed.  We can't wait to go back!  I've also had their food delivered and it travels really well."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-24 21:08:53", "review_text": "Best santa barbara Uni sushi in United State.\nAn authentic hole in a wall Japanese restaurant owned by a very nice Japanese owner.\nOther pupus and entrees are very good as well.\nTemporary they are serving food with plastic containers which is understandable too."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-08 23:10:21", "review_text": "My girlfriend and i were both craving japanese food, and this was the perfect spot. A very laid back place with a diverse menu, fresh fish, and great entrees. Not to mention lovely staff! We ordered quite a few things, and our favorites were the tuna crispy rice, yakiniku, and katsu curry rice! I would certainly suggest coming here!"}]}
