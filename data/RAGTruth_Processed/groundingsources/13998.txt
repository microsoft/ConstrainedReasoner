We parked a few blocks up the street.\n\nThe food was freshly made and delicious. We tried the Machaca burrito and the chicken fajitas. Best Mexican ever in Carpenteria! \n\nThe market also stocks a huge selection of beer and wine. The cherry on top was finding our favorite Mexican beer that is difficult to find in LA."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-07-25 03:55:43", "review_text": "Woww my friend recommended lunch from this place and honestly it just might be my new favorite spot in town! We shared nachos and a torta and the torta was literally the same size as a Costco chicken bake. I was literally expecting it to be half of that size. My order came out to $21 and this could have easily fed 3 people, so you definitely get your moneys worth! Wait time might take about 15-20 minutes since they are always super busy!"}]}
