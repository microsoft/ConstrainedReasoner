We came in to try this awesome looking old fashion with candied bacon and to say the least I am disappointed.  Its extremely sweet and just overall not well made.

She is not kind and they have miserable looks on there faces. I wont be back ever."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-09-12 23:23:03", "review_text": "Stopped for a quick lunch and beer .
