Corn soaked with fishy taste. Things looked like they were quickly scrambled together.\nPrices were high--yes, it's Santa Barbara, however, the quality better be unreal for the prices they're commanding (plus tax and then tip). \n\nMany California eateries don't know how to prepare seafood. \nDon't know if this is a California thing? Perhaps, the owner, chef, etc...need a trip to New England and/or Maryland to see how seafood is really done. Quality is very impt, not the illusion (perception) of quality. Maybe it's a  touristy-type place?"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2018-08-02 00:56:46", "review_text": "Super expensive for very little food. Lobster roll was very little.

Tasty. Would have preferred a biu instead of sliced bread. The chowder was excellent. Fries were covered with cheese, bacon and chowder. Not what I expected but still good. The shrimp required more work than worth the effort. The corn was delicious. Overall a good experience. We will be back to further explore the menu."}]}
