Drove by the El Pastorcito Mobile 3 nights in a row on our way to our hotel and would see a crowd of people at this taco truck every night. (East Beach on S Milpas St) They have tables set up and some lights. It's a fun scene. We decided to check it out. So glad we did. Go get you some al Pastor tacos and burritos and all of it. \nWe had the birria tacos too - which were fine but nothing to go on and on about. But the el pastor... damn good! Squeeze on some lime, a splash of the salsa verde. Game ON! \nWould go back again and again. In fact we did - we got back in line and got another taco and burrito the same night because it was SO good.\nGO!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-06-18 02:32:15", "review_text": "First time trying them. I ordered the tripa tacos and an asada mulita with an horchata. Everything was delicious. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu"}]}
