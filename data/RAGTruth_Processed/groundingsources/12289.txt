{"question": "how to make pork chop", "passages": "passage 1:The chops are baked at 425 degrees F for 20 minutes or until the chops reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. Allow chops to stand for 3 minutes at room temperature before serving. To stuff, cut a pocket in the side of each pork chop.\n\npassage 2:To make stuffed pork chops, a small pocket is cut into the side of a pork loin chop to create a space for stuffing. Then a mixture of feta cheese, pesto, and pine nuts is spooned into each pocket. If necessary, the edges of each pocket can be secured with wooden toothpicks to keep the filling in place.\n\npassage 3:How to Saute Chops. The easiest way to fry pork chops is to saute them, which means to cook them quickly in a little oil in a skillet. Boneless or bone-in rib or loin chops, cut 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, work well for this. For four chops, heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil or olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n\n"}
