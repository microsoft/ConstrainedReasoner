{"question": "what is the effect of carbon footprint", "passages": "passage 1:Your carbon footprint measures the environmental impact of your lifestyle. Everything you do has an impact --- positive or negative --- on the environment. That's the concept behind your carbon footprint, which is one method of measuring the environmental effect of your lifestyle. A carbon footprint, measured in tons, indicates the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are produced as a result of your daily activities. You can reduce your footprint by changing the way you live your life. Even seemingly tiny changes can make a significant difference.\n\npassage 2:It all comes back to the average carbon footprint. The average per capita carbon footprint is 6 tons per year. In the U.S. the average is 20 tons per year, and a third of that is created by automobile emissions -- meaning your car itself can put out over 6 tons of C02 a year -- enough for two people.\n\npassage 3:So what exactly is a carbon footprint? In simplest terms, carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced by various human activities within a given time frame. Carbon footprint is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere. Your home has a carbon footprint if you use oil, coal or gas to heat it. That cheeseburger at your favorite restaurant has a carbon footprint: raising the beef and wheat and operating the restaurant all involves greenhouse gases. Your car has a carbon footprint, dependent on the vehicle\u2019s fuel consumption and driving distance.\n\n"}
