Maybe we were desperate but we decided to come to Hob Nob because we were parked outside of it. \n\nOur initial impression was that this place was kind of alright. It seemed spacious with a back dining area, front loungy area, and small bar. As we came in, some people were leaving and you could hear the waitress and bartender shout out \"thanks for coming!\" We thought this would be a start to a good experience.\n\nWe took a seat at the bar, kind of waited for a while, but the starvation kicked into place. By this point I was frantically looking around trying to get SOME waiter's attention. There was one standing right behind us talking to a guest that just walked in. -- ignored for another couple of minutes--. Finally came, took our order and came back with our drinks.\n\nThe food on the other hand.. took ... for..... e.... ver..... Despite this, we enjoyed the truffle Parmesan fries. Yes tasty indeed - but cmon forks would have been appreciated. Unfortunately I could no longer overlook the slow service. We received our water that we asked for after we had already half-way eaten the fries. I probably should have learned my lesson by now.. but nope - I was still hungry and ordered the calamari (I blame yelp for this one! pictures on the site were not how they appeared in real life!). The calamari took almost 30-40 minutes to bring out. To put this in persepective... there were probably max 8 other people at this establishment at the time. NOT really sure why it took so long. And when it **FINALLY** came out - well it wasn't hot and fresh as I expected and it was really poorly done - overcooked and the batter crumbled off the calamari. \n\nall in all\n- slow ass service\n- mediocre to okay food\n- cool vibe but not enough to salvage feeling starved and thirsty\n\nWe kept our cool. Smiled and was courteous - after all we were too tired and hungry to really put up a hissy fit, but we'll never stop by here again i'm pretty sure."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2011-02-15 18:14:59", "review_text": "If you wandered in for a drink and stayed for some food, you'll do just fine. The calamari was particularly above average, and the ahi tuna nachos looked fantastic as they went by.\n\nif you made a special trip to come here, you should maybe upgrade your Yelp skills. Service was well-meaning but not terrifically competent and the food was tasty, but about as interesting as you'd find at your average corporate hotel restaurant (though definitely better priced)."}]}
