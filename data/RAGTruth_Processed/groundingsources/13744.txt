It might be the best salad I've had in my entire life, and this is coming from a self-described salad aficionado. The cantaloupe is just past ripe and it is served over a generous helping of delicious SPROUTS along with the rest of the aforementioned ingredients. I really wish this place wasn't closed as I've tried recreating this salad but haven't had any luck at all."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2010-10-15 01:54:30", "review_text": "The line is long around the lunch hour, but it's understandable.\n\nI really liked the scrambled eggs breakfast combo, although I was disappointed with the eggs were obviously watery (made from instant liquid yolk). The ham I asked for was also straight up sandwich ham. I was expecting a ham steak for some reason.\n\nOverall the breakfast was okay though. Very filling\n\nI'll likely be coming here, perhaps to try other breakfast options or salads"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2010-08-04 22:46:00", "review_text": "Gaucho Cafe is a no-frills salad and sandwich place with a DEEP menu that doesn't disappoint. The place has a huge selection of hot and cold sandwiches with plenty of options for us vegetarians. I have been here a handful of times, and I have never been unhappy with my food. The sandwiches don't come with anything else, and look plain and lonely on a white paper plate, but throw on a side salad for a buck, and you have a nice happy lunch. The food is definitely tasty, but the portions could be a bit bigger, and the ingredients could be fresher. Besides that (and their cash-only policy) I have no complaints. The service is friendly and pleasant, the food is great, and their options are almost endless. Easily one of the best places to eat on campus."}]}
