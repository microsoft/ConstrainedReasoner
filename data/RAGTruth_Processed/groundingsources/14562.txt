The employee at this location stunned me with her behavior and attitude. She was visibly frustrated at the level of difficulty she was experiencing separating American cheese with her gloves. Was not not able to place cheese evenly on the sandwich. Fine, sometimes your sandwiches aren't %100. After painfully watching her struggle with the vegetables we get to the sauces. Now, my 12 year old daughter who is learning to confidently make orders and requests, asked this lady for \"heavy\" mustard. Your employee grabbed the honey mustard and proceeded to coat this sandwich with an amount of honey mustard that still confuses me, as I reflect on it. I understand that this was a miscommunication. My daughter said \"heavy\", she (subway employee) wasn't the best English speaker, I get it. I apologized and explained what happened. My daughter didn't want the honey mustard. How does she solve this problem? Scrape off the honey mustard, of course. Except, as I mentioned before, she has already disrespected this sandwich with a comical glob of this translucent slime. There is no way, this is going to work. I ask if maybe we can replace the cheese altogether, not wanting to waste the sandwich. Annoyed, She says she would have to charge me for extra cheese. I sigh, and agree reluctantly. So she remove the cheese, and replaces it with new cheese. Please keep in mind that there is still a healthy portion of honey mustard on this sandwich. This lady leans forward, looking like the villain from the little mermaid, and snarls at my daughter. \"Do you want mustard on this or not?\". This is why in sitting here writing this nonsense. This lady literally reduced me to basic parental instincts, and made me want to fight her over a sandwich. I literally would have bought another sandwich and just tossed that one thay was wrong to avoid conflict. She was unreasonably disrespectful. Factor in that she was speaking to a child. A CHILD! Anyways, I did Yell at her. I told her that she was not to speak to my daughter that way. how hard is it to make a sandwich? She got angry and told us that she refuses service and threw away all 4 of the sandwiches she was making us. I will also be filing other observations I made with the health department. And corperate also gets a copy. Just as a middle finger. I can't get the image of this lady halfheartedly scraping the fat glob honey mustard off of that sandwich. Like what is shrinkage at this location like? Anyways, I will definitely follow up with this. That glob of honey mustard tho....man..."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-05-10 01:07:26", "review_text": "I made an order to take out paid with Apple Pay. I got to the subway to pick it up, two young male employees working. One did not have a mask and was constantly wiping his face. The other had a mask that sat below his nose. I asked the employee without the mask where his mask was, and he pointed to it sitting on the counter where the bread sits to make sandwiches.  DO NOT EAT HERE. I could not get refund, fed sandwich to crows during my walk home."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2018-10-22 23:25:41", "review_text": "Hardly any tuna in the sandwich. Tasted more of the bread than I actually did the tuna. Noticed that it is also being scooped up by a smaller scooper too. It use to be bigger. The guy that wrapped my sandwich must be new or something because he did not make the sandwich nicely (most ingrediants were on the wrapper and he also didn't wrap the sandwich correctly. Everything was falling out of it. I normally like all the Subway's I go to, but the one on Milpas needs to be less greedy when it comes to the serving amount of tuna, like I said before, there was hardly any tuna on the sandwich and also better at putting the sandwich together. I most likely won't go back to this Subway."}]}
