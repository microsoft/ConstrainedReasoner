New owners were not given the keys, something about a rent dispute with the landlords. The management had to scramble to alert people with Valentine dinner reservations that they were SOL.\n\nAh well. Here's my review of the place anyway. I sampled their goods at a couple fundraising events, and visited the restaurant once for an after-party event. All times I thought the food was decent.\n\nThe interior, as commented by others, seems like a backdrop of a David Lynch film. Dark halls, red velvet, the rooms keep going back back back. It was sort of creepy.\n\nThe price? I am aware the place was spendy and that was my main issue with the Melting Pot. Fondue is easy! It's always been lazy food to me. Too lazy to do a dinner party? Make fondue and give your guests half prepared food and make them do the rest!\nSo, getting feedback from friends grousing that a cheese and chocolate fondue set them back $75 each is wince-worthy. \n\nThe restaurant was also vast, and in an area with little foot traffic. It also often looked closed, because the blinds were down to block the glaring sun off the west windows. \n\nThat said, the people who worked there were very friendly and helpful. I'm sorry they lost their jobs."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2009-12-13 20:21:40", "review_text": "The experience was 5-stars worth, as I am new to fondue and it was a fun night out with the girls.  However, 4 stars for value, and service.  After sitting in our booth for quite a while, we finally were able to order drinks, which we then waited for our drinks to arrive.  Once we finally ordered, the service was prompt and our server checked on us regularly.  This is not a cheap night out, it is about $9 per person, per fondue that you order, and we tried the appetizer portions so we could taste more than one cheese.  The items you get for dipping don't seem to warrant the price - tortilla chips, bread, apples, veggies.  It seemed steep to me, but the cheese was quite tasty.  \nAll in all, a tasty and fun night out, with a hard hit to the wallet."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2009-11-11 21:28:58", "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. I'll start with the good. The place is gorgeous and the staff was friendly. The salads we had were both very good. Unfortunately, the rest is bad news.\n\nOur waitress, although very nice, didn't know anything about the wine list. I asked for a buttery chardonnay but the one she recommended was sweet and acidic instead. This inauspicious start was the precursor to an evening of well meaning incompetence.\n\nFor the cheese fondue, we ordered the traditional Swedish. The fondue was prepared for us at the table. After asking us if we were garlic lovers (and we are), our waitress plonked a hefty portion of raw garlic into the wine base. Most traditional recipes have you season the bowl by rubbing it with garlic, so this was beyond overkill. The traditional recipe finishes up with a dash of kirsch. Our server was as generous with the kirsch as she was with the garlic. There was so much wine for the base that the consistency of the fondue was watery instead of the rich molten gooeyness that you want with a cheese fondue. The result was terrible to the point where I actually asked her to make us something different. I almost never complain in restaurants, but this was truly inedible.\n\nWe tried the beer/cheddar fondue next. Once again our server overdid the garlic, but cheddar is a little more forgiving, provided it's sufficiently sharp and there's a solid mustard base to work with. Unfortunately this did not prove to be the case, and once again the consistency was watery.\n\nFor dipping we had some chopped apples (tasty), an assortment of raw veggies (also tasty) and a bowl of chopped up bread bits. The bread was stale with a dense crumb and soft crust. The staleness was unfortunate, but the choice of a dense crumb was stupid and the soft crust simply idiotic. Given the watery consistency of the fondues is clearly intentional, the apples and veggies made poor choices for dipping since they could barely get enough fondue on them to have flavor. The bread should have a nice crunchy crust to provide a textural offset to the creaminess of the fondue. The crumb should be open, light and chewy to carry the fondue. This is basic cooking 101 stuff, not deep insights.\n\nWe left in disgust without even trying a main course. The bill was over $50 for two salads, a crappy bottle of wine that we barely touched and two failed attempts at a cheese fondue."}]}
