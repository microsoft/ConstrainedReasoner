Love the food and service at this location specifically. I know there are many different chick fil a's but this one in particular nails customer service. When they mess up on an order (which they rarely do) they always make sure to make it right! That's customer service which is pretty hard to find in the fast food industry."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-22 05:05:38", "review_text": "Love it!
