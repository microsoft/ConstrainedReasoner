The one bartender that actually talked to me I guess is only an emergency bartender who only gets to work when someone else cancels. Came in one night as a non-working employee was leaving. The bartender was in the back room for almost 10 minutes while I was waiting to order. The leaving employee was nice enough to serve me. The  Thursday bartender never greeted me afterwards, never asked if I wanted anything else, never said anything to me but played on his phone, watched an infommercial. I guess I'll be finding another bar for when I'm in town."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-07-06 20:51:22", "review_text": "The bar tender there Matt Topete makes drinking at old town tavern an experience in its self, he is quick on the draw with a drink and may not be able to tell one but can take a joke. He knows more than most about sports and will have a conversation with any patron and make them feel right at home"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-06-15 09:37:57", "review_text": "Love the bar the people and the tenders. If you can find a liquor they don't have. They'll get it. Karaoke dj rocks the house best attentive dj ever again if he doesn't have a song he'll get it."}]}
