This review is not biased, pure 100%  our experience staying at Ritz Carlton Bacara Santa Barbara. \n\nRitz Carlton SB is not located in a prime area. This is a resort,  their property is isolated away from downtown so that customers can enjoy the activities that the resort provides, such as hiking by the beach, biking around the hotel area. Mind you, this hotel is not walkable to restaurants in SB, they provided their own chain restaurants to make guests enjoy and relax at the property.\n\nHere is our experience:\nLike any other experienced travellers, we booked our hotels through credit card partners using our mileage. Who pay their hotel rooms in full nowadays anyways? Most smart people pay their hotel rooms with points or mileage affiliated with credit cards company. Originally we booked for double beds. However a day before, I received an email from them that my room was changed to single bed. This is quite impossible to our situation since we have 2 adults and 2 children. So I called (many times) to our credit card company and to Ritz to make sure we would get 2 double beds instead of 1 single king bed. The number of phone calls to change the number of beds did not happen only in one call, unfortunately. I had to call them several times before our arrival. \n\nSo, arrival day, we got our 2 double beds. Perfect. Checking in was a smooth process. The receptionist was polite, explaining us everything about the resort. By the way, the resort has so many activities that you could book first through their website. And I also appreciate the concierge emailed us days before reminding us about the activities on the days we stay. (Tips: the receptionist offered us a transportation like a luggage cart to transport the guests to your villas, ACCEPT IT! Ritz carlton property is so huge that you can even get lost in the area. You can walk if you want to reach your 10k steps, though). \n\nWhen we got to our hotel, problem arise. Tv did not work. I called the receptionist, and the technician came after an hour later. They tried their best to fix tv, unfortunately the problem was much bigger than they expected. The sad part was they KNEW the tv was broken already and Ritz didn't even solve the problem. (Technician told me our previous guest also had the same problem - broken tv). So, me just being me, asking for a compensation for the broken tv. The technician was very generous giving us $100 restaurant fee.  And I took it with my grateful heart. \n\nResort wise; this property again has a lot activities that you can do with your kids, partners, etc. Hiking by the beach is the most popular activities done by my people. Biking around the area also a great thing to do. \n\nDuring check out time, there was a bit problem since I wanted to redeem the $100 certificate that the technician gave me. A bit miscommunication happened at that time, but they resolved it quickly.\n\nWould I recommend you guys to stay here? if you have $1000 extra to spare for staying a night here, sure you should. \nDon't forget to add\nParking vallet is $53 a day\nResort fee is $50 a day. (that's why maximise the property since you're charged hefty for resort fee). \n\nOther than that, yes I would stay again here. Hopefully I can bump this review to 4 star next time."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-28 21:00:04", "review_text": "Amazing hotel with such such comfy rooms. We had a iv and there was an area right outside the room where he could go in the morning..so so convenient..there was a small lawn with a gorgeous fountain right outside the room which was awesome. The GYM WAS BEYOND FANTASTIC!!! the views were great. Service was great at the coffee shop and the bar. Room service we got it in the lobby was great. THE YUCCA FRIES ARE A MUST Have!!! The chips and guacamole were totally yum! We got takeout in the lobby and hung out which was so fun! Having a fridge and microwave in the room was so helpful. We will definitely come back. Highly recommend!"}]}
