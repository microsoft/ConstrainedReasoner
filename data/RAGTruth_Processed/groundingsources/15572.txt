{"question": "what is a transistor how does it work", "passages": "passage 1:The design of a transistor allows it to function as an amplifier or a switch. This is accomplished by using a small amount of electricity to control a gate on a much larger supply of electricity, much like turning a valve to control a supply of water.he base pulls these electrons from the emitter because it has a more positive voltage than does the emitter. This movement of electrons creates a flow of electricity through the transistor. The current passes from the emitter to the collector through the base.\n\npassage 2:A transistor is a miniature electronic component that can do two different jobs. It can work either as an amplifier or a switch: 1  When it works as an amplifier, it takes in a tiny electric current at one end (an input current) and produces a much bigger electric current (an output current) at the other.2  Transistors can also work as switches.ormally, the holes in the base act like a barrier, preventing any significant current flow from the emitter to the collector while the transistor is in its off state. A transistor works when the electrons and the holes start moving across the two junctions between the n-type and p-type silicon.\n\npassage 3:A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power.It is composed of semiconductor material with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit.ollector current is approximately \u03b2 (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications. Unlike the field-effect transistor (see below), the BJT is a low\u2013input-impedance device.\n\n"}
