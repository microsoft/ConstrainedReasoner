Back for a visit. My wife has a severe gluten allergy (epi-pen) not just a fad. Server was awesome explaining kitchen was not gluten free but since they were slow that day (new year's eve), she'd ask the cook to wipe down the grill. Food was great. Wine was outstanding. Service was exceptional. Thanks!!! Can't find my receipt. Otherwise I'd give a shout out to the server too (she has allergies and empathized)."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-25 20:42:33", "review_text": "My first time at this restaurant was about a month ago, we waited for about 15 minutes before she / waitress took our order, this was during the week for lunch, so were like well it happens sometimes but I was there this pass week and the same waitress was there and we waited 20 minutes, she keep on saying give a minute and I'll take you order. We just left the restaurant because that's not acceptable, this is very bad customer service."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-11-14 01:48:33", "review_text": "I've driven by this place on the corner many times and always see people eating on the porch out front. We decided to give it a try on a 90 degree day, and unfortunately the umbrellas didn't cover enough of the patio and there was no AC inside so that made the experience a bit un-pleasurable. The staff was rushed and didn't pay much attention to us. But the food was good! Not high quality but tasty. Nothing special but satisfying. \n\nI had the veggie sandwich, to switch things up from my usual go tos and was very pleased. The onion rings were light and crispy too! Those were a hit around the table! Everyone enjoyed their food so we walked away feel good. Wish I had picked a place that could have impressed a bit more."}]}
