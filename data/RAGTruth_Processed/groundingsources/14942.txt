Whether you have Anthony as your bartender, Joseph, Tracy, or Britany you know you are going to get the best service and have the best experience. I will keep going back and hope that Whole Foods keeps them for a long time and maybe eventually gives them a remodel with more seating and better hours."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-09-28 21:09:16", "review_text": "I love this place!
