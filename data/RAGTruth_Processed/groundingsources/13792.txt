They were the worst catering team I had ever worked with in my years of working in the industry. The owners were the only workers older than 21, which normally wouldn't be a problem if they were professional. The \"kids\" (as the owners called them) stood around by the bar feeding each other the wedding cake and joking while there were dishes all over the tables. When I asked one of the \"kids\" for help, he said he couldn't because he was drinking a soda! Un-freaking-believable! I informed the owner what the \"kid\" just told me and she basically told me I shouldn't be asking the team to do things because I'm not their boss, but the other owner told me to ask the team for whatever I needed. Neither one apologized for his ridiculous behavior. This kind of stuff happened all night. At the end of the night, they were responsible for bussing ALL the dishes. Of course, they did not. I asked the owner to have the team finish up and she said they said they were done. We were both looking at the tables and I said that I see quite a few dishes still. Her daughter, one of the serving staff, grunted and stormed off. I would not recommend this catering team to anyone that is relying on the staff for an event. Indras, the owner, was very helpful before the wedding, but I didn't see him much throughout the event. His wife was not so pleasant to work with."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-01-17 03:09:29", "review_text": "The Fig Grill, having largely failed to meet the promise of its previous owner, Fresco, is no longer in business and the doors are now closed. While I never like to see a business close, this new owner failed to take requisite notice of customer reviews and numerous comments about poor food quality.  Given the great location and former reputation of this restaurant, the owner worked hard to disappoint new and returning customers."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-12-21 04:19:22", "review_text": "Do I really have to give it even one star?  We have been to Fresco North countless times and never was disappointed but this new concept is beyond terrible.  \n\nI got a chicken caesar wrap which is hard to mess up but the tortilla was raw... Yes, raw.  It was rather plain just salad and chicken and was waaaay oversized.  It was two in one.\n\nMy wife got the grilled cheese with white bean soup.  The soup was basic, minestrone style soup but it was hardly even warm.  The grilled cheese was cold, in fact the  cheese was already so cold it would just tear apart rather than stringy (Hope that makes sense).  \n\nMy son had the small plate Mac n cheese.  Not bad but also cold.  \n\nNothing was hot including the restaurant.  We thought we would walk into a warm place to sit and enjoy dinner with it 53 degrees outside but were blasted with freezing air from the AC!  The AC was probably set to 60 something. \n\nI should have known it was going to be bad from seeing all 4 cars in the parking lot.  This is NOT the same restaurant it once was.  I will NOT be back unless they bring back Fresco North."}]}
