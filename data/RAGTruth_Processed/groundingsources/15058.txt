Chicken tika masala, tandoori chicken, curry chicken, etc. There were many Indian dishes with dressings and they were well prepared and delicious.\nThe lunch buffet was $9.99 per person and soda and drinks were extras.\nThe server was attentive and okay but he was on the bluetooth phone all time while we were having lunch.\nI would go back for a lunch buffet next time, and they are good food for the money."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-05-17 21:52:32", "review_text": "***REVIEW FOR STREET SHOP***\n \nThere was an awesome car show going on that Saturday and in the corner we found this amazing pop up shop. It invited you in with incents and beautiful Indian textiles. Upon walking in this homemade tent you can see wall to wall art. There was Indian imported rugs, clothing, metal ohm symbols, hand carved wooden jewelry boxes, handmade cloth posters and much more. The jewelry initially caught my eye they are very unique items.  Everything was in a rich coloring and beautiful taste. I stumbled upon a large cloth poster of Mother Lakshmi. It was bright in color and had beautiful beads on it. I knew instantly that I needed it! Not only was this a wonderful part run in but the owner was delightful."}]}
