We got the buccaneer, which comes in a young coconut, and the Thai iced tiki. I wasn't a fan of the Thai iced tiki. I thought the all spice was a little overpowering but it was still a fun drink with the popping liquid pearls on top. The buccaneer was also fresh and I liked that it was in a coconut because we were able to eat as a side snack!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-15 21:13:30", "review_text": "This was a really fun bar to go to. Great crowd on a Sunday funday. They have nice outdoor seating. Drink prices are reasonable and taste phenomenal. Perfect for a date or a fun hang."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-06 02:49:11", "review_text": "Stumbled upon this bar Sunday around 3pm while we were exploring Funkzone; it was relatively empty so we were able to sit wherever we wanted. \n\nThe bartender is knowledgeable and accommodating, the cups for cocktails are very instagram-able if that's your thing, and the decor is well thought out with open-air beach vibes. \n\nThe drink list is LONG and had something for everyone in our group- strong drinks, creative drinks, and twist on classic drinks. \n\nDefinitely recommend a pit stop here if you're in the mood for a creative cocktail!"}]}
