{"question": "what is the difference between tier 3 and tier 4 engines", "passages": "passage 1:Below is a diagram from Cummins showing the difference between the Tier 3 engines and the Tier 4 Interim engines. As shown below the muffler is replaced by the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) which also acts as a muffler; plus the addition of the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system.\n\npassage 2:Tier 4 refers to a set of emissions requirements established by the EPA to reduce emissions of particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other harmful toxins from new, non-road diesel engines. As part of this clean-air initiative, the EPA established acceptable levels of emissions in diesel engines.\n\npassage 3:The Tier 1to 3 standards are met primarily through improvementsin the combustion process with no, or only limited useof exhaust aftertreatment (oxidation catalysts). In 2004, the EPA signed the final rule introducing Tier 4emission standards, to be phased-in over the period of2008 to 2015.\n\n"}
