We walked by this place and decided to try it out. First we were greeted with kind smiles and did not have to wait to be seated. Michael was our server and he was so so so kind! We ordered the Chile Verde Omelette and Eggs with Bacon. We received our food fast! The food was great, the service was amazing, and the environment was great!\n\nGive this place a try!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-29 01:04:47", "review_text": "Great breakfast and service.

The Customer service at this place is awesome and deserves 5 stars by itself. They are very friendly, prompt, and kept our coffees filled. If you notice the other reviews where Karens were complaining about bad service, were leaving reviews around when covid peaked so don't pay attention to those. I assure you the service is great.\n\nThe food is not bad, however it is basic, and safe. Don't get me wrong,  the food tasted fine, it's just that they play it safe which I guess is a good thing so that Karens in SB (There are plenty in this town) don't complain."}]}
