I'm a big fan of having multiple businesses under one roof, having gone to school in Boston I always enjoyed my visits to the famous Faneuil Hall Marketplace.  This is far from that, but the feel is there. \n\nBig plus, \u00a0you can bring food from anywhere in the market and sit at The Garden.  The Garden is a big bar area at the front entrance, relative to the hall, with various beers and wines.  They also have a few televisions so it's a good spot to congregate and eat/consume. \n\nit's an easy spot to grab some grub and a beer, totally casual.  There is a bit of a premium on the beer."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-08-28 01:59:00", "review_text": "Darn it. I wanted to like this place so much. I did, for years. Heck, I gave them a five-star rating a mere two days prior. Can't say that I am much of a fan anymore. \n\nChanging my review to three stars due to the bartender's lack of service. We waited 10 minutes as he went on his phone and helped others after us. Not worth the time when there are so many other bars in Santa Barbara. We left without service.\n\nI hope that ownership takes note of their staff's level of service and implements measures to improve upon it. A busy bar is one thing; the staff member scrolling through his phone while there are patrons waiting is a whole other level of low. You're going to lose customers!\n\nI now understand why this venue has an average rating of three stars, not four or five. A mediocre experience overall. Regretfully, I probably will not be back."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-08-27 04:29:42", "review_text": "this place is not worth the exorbitant prices and rude, inattentive bar staff. it's not hard to see when someone is sitting at the bar trying to get your attention. like... it's literally your job, not social hour. f this place"}]}
