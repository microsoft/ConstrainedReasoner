It's a place where you pregame before hitting the other hole in the wall bars and the dance floor is good place to warm up your moves before waiting in line to get into a bigger place. It's  also a great place to end the since most people are dancing and thinking the same thing. New Management tells they will be getting a face-lift and I welcome it. Hope it's restored to it's former glory."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-04 23:44:09", "review_text": "Stoked that Nelson is here now! The spot is a SB institution. Intimate inside bar with a intrinsically dope patio. The asiatic theme is exotic and fun. Strong drinks and attractive bartenders is always a winner!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-16 22:02:13", "review_text": "This place is a Santa Barbara landmark. It's boutique nature makes it selective and exclusive. It's Black Market liquor selection is second to none. One should arrive around 10 ish to avoid the lines or be prepared to wait or tip for entry (but worth not waiting). Currently open Thurs thru Sat but i hear more days to come. Keep in eye on this one!!!"}]}
