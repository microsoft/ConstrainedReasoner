They have awesome margaritas and decent seating outside. The staff is always pleasant. The food is another story. Since we usually just go for drinks and chips (good salsa) I can only speak for today's dinner. The food is expensive. $16 for a tostada. We decided to split it. The staff split it in the back and brought it to us on two plates (again, the staff is great). The quality?  Not good. I thought for sure it was canned chicken, the beans definitely right out of a can. There was nothing to substantiate a $16 meal. I would have complained if it was $5 cuz flat out it wasn't good. They refunded us the $16 for food and we happily paid the $36 for drinks. Go for the drinks and target the days when they serve free appetizers during happy hour. You'll never be disappointed."}]}
