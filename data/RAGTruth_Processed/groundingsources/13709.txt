They have a wide selection of donuts and their bagels are always tasty. I especially enjoy their homemade cream cheese flavors - I haven't had anything like them! Their vegetable cream had chopped up veggies in it and their strawberry cream cheese had jam. Definitely stop by to try some delicious bagel and cream cheese combo and donuts!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-25 19:20:52", "review_text": "So happy to have stumbled upon this bagel place. I've had hundreds of NY bagels of the years but I'm telling you something about the bagels is special. I ordered the everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese and lox. Literal perfection.

Trey and the boys laid it down, but the reason I was able to rokk was Spudnuts and Bagels. Had 3 of my 5 meals there while in town. The bagels are crispy but somehow airy not chewy! The ham and cheese filled croissant - get 2 or 3. The lady who was helping me was super nice and took the time to answer all my questions. When she found out i was flying her goods home to the fam she gave me some xtras she wanted them to try - thank you S&B!!"}]}
