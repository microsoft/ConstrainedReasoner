Whenever I am craving sushi I come here. This particular night, it was our first time eating in for dinner because our place had no electricity for 12 hours, we were hungry and needed some light. I usually order take out so it was different eating in. The rolls seemed a little bit bigger than when you order take out. The nigiri is usually consistent, occasionally when it's take out they sometimes give you more rice but the fish size is always the same. Some nigiris at other sushi places are tiny and cost double the price but at Sushi Teri the price is decent in comparison to the size of their nigiri. Which is the main reason I come here. \nWe ordered quite a few things to try out other than our usual. We got the calamari, dynamite, four types of rolls, and uni, unagi and salmon nigiris. For the longest time I was looking for a decent dynamite dish and had no idea they served it here because it was never in the appetizer section, it was hidden as a meal. I really liked it for the fact that it's bigger with a lot of scallops and a few big mussels, the price itself was decent considering other places sell it for about the same price for the size of an appetizer. As for the calamari appetizer, it was a horrible fail, the batter was thin but it was not crispy, the initial bite felt like a dried jerky texture on the outside then after that initial bite you get the tenderness of the calamari. The uni nigiri was fresh as usual, the unagi and salmon was great! The four rolls we ordered were called Monkey roll, orange roll, broken heart roll and the real crab roll, we specifically got these roll because it didn't have any imitation crab on the inside. The Monkey roll was out favorite out of the four rolls. Our least favorite roll was the real crab roll, it was super disappointing because there was not enough real crab in it to taste it. I hope this place stays the same because I will continue coming here for their nigiris!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-25 04:43:43", "review_text": "I've been eating here (as in all locations but mostly Goleta) for the past 20 years, and it never gets old. Sushi Terri is just the best and I don't understand why there are bad reviews. Sushi is always so good and tastes fresh. The miso soup broth is great. The staff is friendly and helpful. Always a quick meal too. I will eat at Sushi Terri for the rest of my life. Highly recommend."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-28 03:33:18", "review_text": "Sushi Teri Goleta what an experience ! If you are looking for slow service and unpresentable rolls this is your place. Girlfriend and I were looking to grab some quick rolls and didn't feel like driving  down to Santa Barbara for the Sushi Teri on Bath St. So we decided to try out this location. I'd like to start off with the appetizers. Miso soup (with no seaweed!) had to be at least at room  temperature and spicy edamame was more\n of a garlic edamame For our rolls we had ordered one \"Baked AF\" and a \"Broken Heart.\" The only \"baked\" part about the first roll was the tin foil. It had gotten stuck to our roll which eventually lead to the roll falling apart after we tried to grab a singular piece. I understood why they had named the second roll the \"Broken Heart\" because it had broke my heart when I saw how poorly this roll was presented. Noting back to the slow service, We were checked on once by our server and once she had heard about my experience another server attended to us one to drop off the check. So thank you Sushi Teri Goleta, will stick to supporting the location down town ! They never miss"}]}
