I ordered the ribeye and I gotta say the flavor is underwhelming  I guess I expected too much in that it would be steakhouse quality but it's not.  It's more like average coffee shop quality so I'm not impressed. The flavor also was lacking a bit as it's not seasoned all that well."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2014-11-28 21:48:31", "review_text": "I'm not sure how this place is getting good reviews. I'm staying at the hotel because my daughter is hospitalized at cottage. Having to spend Thanksgiving in the hospital really bites but we were with family. My husband didn't want to eat the hospital food so suggested the restaurant. They had a special menu as it was Thanksgiving. I ordered it to go to eat dinner with our daughter. When I got it back to the hospital room I couldn't be more disappointed. $20 plate of barely any food. I let my husband eat mine and I had what the hospital served which was half the price double the food and better quality. I mean there were literally 4 green beans and 3 carrot slices in each container. We will not be eating here ever again. What a rip off."}]}
