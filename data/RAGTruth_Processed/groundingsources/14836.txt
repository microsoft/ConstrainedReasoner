You get seated by the host, then go order at the cashier and they bring your food to you. I opted for the pulled pork sandwich with kale salad since it seemed like their bbq is quite popular here. Paired my meal with their Pilsner and I was very satisfied. The kale salad was delicious and the pulled pork in the sandwich was really nicely flavored, and didn't have too much sauce.  I took half home and it made for great leftovers. The patio is dog friendly and there's plenty of seating. They also have a nice selection of drinks from their own beers to wine, micheladas and margaritas. I'd definitely revisit."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 08:26:56", "review_text": "Super Solid spot in the funk zone for food. Beer didn't do much for me, but it's okay. \n\nTacos are nuts good. Pork, fish and chicken were all just great. My wife like fish best. I was partial to the pulled pork, but you can't go wrong no matter which way you go!  \n\nAlso tried the avocado salad with smoked turkey, which was very good. And a side of Elote that was excellent!  \n\nGreat food and worth your time!  Food 5. Beer 3."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-02 05:40:06", "review_text": "The horchata was pretty good I think they added something else to it since it didn't taste like authentic horchata. I had the Little Gem salad, which was pretty good but I would've expected them to add some kind of meat to it? It was the half size but for almost $10 I really thought it could've been worth adding some chicken in it?\n\nThe street corn was atrocious. I would avoid this dish unless you wanna overpay for the taste of corn with barely any of the other stuff they supposedly add in there. Not even cotija cheese! I get that this is an Americanized version of Mexican food but honestly for $11 I only took one bite and I hated it. Social anxiety got the better of me and I should've asked for them to take it back and make me something else.\n\nAnyway, nothing about what I ate was outstanding so I doubt I'm coming back."}]}
