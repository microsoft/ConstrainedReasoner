We only got to try one item but will be back for sure.\nThe Smoked Pastrami Reuben on Seeded Rye was delicious. It was a good portion & tasted really good. We split it. The mustard was a bit too much for me & burnt my nose. My husband loves meat and he said he wishes it had more meat it in. The side salad was very nice & refreshing, with great dressing."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 21:44:32", "review_text": "This bakery is in a cool arts complex area with a few other restaurants and bars (we came to this same area for dinner the night before at The Lark). Very cool Santa Barbara feel. I had the Farmers Market sandwich (add ham) and he had the taco. We shared the amazing challah French toast (only avail on weekends). The baked egg sandwiches are huge. We loved the outside patio and it's of course dog friendly. 10/10 for us. The espresso\nMachine was down which gave me the opportunity to walk to a coffee shop, Dart, down the street."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 05:38:26", "review_text": "This place was good! I got a BLT and added turkey. It was quite delicious but too ezpensive for what it was. I spent almost $30 for the sandwich + tip. I also didn't love the peppered chips, but I will still give this good scoring because the bread, meat, and everything in between was very good. Service was great, and speedy too."}]}
