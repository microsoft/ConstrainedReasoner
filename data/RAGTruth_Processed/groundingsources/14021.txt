This place is legit for the mere fact that it is very unassuming. We chose this spot because it was a market/restaurant. From my experience fish is best cooked and prepared by those who are in the market of selling it. I ordered the swordfish along with a pint of Central Calfornia's Finest Firestone Ale.   \nI would recommend this to anyone who wants to relax and indulge in great seafood."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2010-01-02 22:25:30", "review_text": "This was our lunch stop during the Captain Jack's winery tour.  It was fairly disappointing even though we kept our choices simple.  I had a cup of clam chowder and a serving of the oysters Rockefeller.  The clam chowder was off in its flavors.  It was a touch more watery than I would have liked.  I also did not come away with a nice rich, buttery flavor; this offering was much less nuanced, pedestrian in nature.  Clam was seldom seen throughout.  The oysters were definitely a miss.  These were not the famous ones from Antoine's.  The variation here was a very thick layer of melted cheese spiked with spinach or was that chives?  I couldn't tell, because the only thing I could taste was cheese.  It even dominated the natural taste of the ocean in the oysters entirely which really misses the point of the dish.  It is called Rockefeller because it is a very rich dish.  This was clunky.  Worse, one could simply scrape off the layer of coagulated cheese and just eat the oyster.  There was no melding of flavors, no subtleness to it at all.   A better name for this dish would have been oysters Velveeta.  Pass."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2009-10-26 02:48:42", "review_text": "We are Santa Barbara locals.  I think they have the best seafood in town.  Don't over look the specials they offer.    I have tried them and they are fantastic!"}]}
