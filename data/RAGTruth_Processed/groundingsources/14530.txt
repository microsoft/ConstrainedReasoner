Their food is delicious and tastes fresh. I tend to order the gyro pita and have never been disappointed. I will say that I ask for extra tzatziki sauce because it can be a bit dry for my taste. The salad is nothing special but a nice side. The fries are a solid choice as well. I appreciate the indoor and outdoor seating and parking is plentiful. The reason for not giving five stars is the wait. I really feel like they need another cook in the back. If you order in-person, be aware that you will be waiting for some time. I now order online and they are usually pretty accurate with pickup time. Otherwise, great food!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-12 02:21:42", "review_text": "Food is so good and Sheila was so sweet!! It was her first day and she was literally so nice.
