We went here because the godmother looked like it had a lot of meat. The godmother tasted delicious but I'm not sure if the other people's pictures of the godmother were with with extra meat but I was honestly disappointed at the amount of meat we had after seeing other peoples pictures.  (For those of you assuming we got less meat because we didn't tip- we tipped over 25% in cash). The pickles they use are in between the sour dill and sweet bread and butter pickles. The salad dressing that came with the salad also had that in between sweet and sour flavor- not overly sweet tho! Wife got the potatoe salad(?) Some potatoes were little on the firm side and had nice mustard flavor. I actually enjoyed her side that came with her sandwich. I also had the mint cake. With the color of the mint, I was hoping for a stronger mint flavor, but to each their own.  I would try this place again. The flavors of their food are good."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 23:22:18", "review_text": "This place is fantastic!
