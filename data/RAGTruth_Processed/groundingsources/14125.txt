Both our orders were delicious- blackened halibut and seafood combo. We ordered a seafood cocktail, and it was too much food considering we also\nOrdered a house salad. The seafood combo was too much for one person. The fish and chips were the best on the combo. The coleslaw was second. \n\nThe halibut was dry, but the caper burre Blanc enhancers the halibut. \nOur waitress was really sweet and interacted with us and we had. Nice short pleasant chat. \nBerry Good mojito was ok and made with vodka and my second mojito was with rum. I liked the rum mojito. Overall we had a great dinner in a great atmosphere!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-16 08:59:56", "review_text": "I was here three times and I always have a good time.
