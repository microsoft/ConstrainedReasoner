We used to come in at 5am to get warm Bolillos and the folks that work here are always super friendly, the bread is always awesome and I always come back.\n\nI filled a bag full of randoms and brought it into work the other day and people loved it and were asking where it came from.\n\nThis place is great - you need to check it out if you havent yet!!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-05-12 04:06:42", "review_text": "Polvorones!!!! The best I've had in a long time! And huge!!!!  I'm just talking about the pink sugar cookies, which are my favorite. It's not overly sweet or lardy. Lots of places are just blah and leave that film in the mouth from all the lard.\n\nI enjoyed it so much I had to come back before going back home. I also bought their bread, which was freshly baked. Omg so good!!! I was bummed they were out of conchas. I bet it's delicious as well. \n\nDefinitely coming back here when I'm in town."}]}
