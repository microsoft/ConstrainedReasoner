Picked up Linguine Vongole (Clam Pasta) and after arriving at home after picking up myself at the restaurant, I noticed that the pasta was standing in inches of \"clam water\". The chef must have sloppily put the clams on tops of the pasta, but with a ton of \"clam water\". Absolutely disgusting. The pasta was soggy and inedible."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-13 04:33:46", "review_text": "The positives -\n\nThe frittata Mista was good with a light crispy outer layer and the fried scallops were really good. The portion was large which was great\n\nThe Bolognese was absolutely delicious definitely try this dish. The pasta was light with large pieces of meat in the sauce. I loved this dish.\n\nThe Meh -\n\nI ordered the truffle pizza and the truffles were very small. The pizza is also not authentic Italian pizza but also not quite like an Italian pizza. It's not terrible but its... meh. I wouldn't order it again. \n\nThe tortino dessert was decent it was very much like an average chocolate cake and it was very small. I thought It would have a more chewy texture and be more like a lava cake. \n\nThe Bad -\n\nI was extremely excited to see that they had fried zucchini blossoms since it was one of my favorite appetizers in Italy. I was very sad to see it looked like fish and chips and tasted like a giant mozzarella stick from like a chili's or something. Yuck. It was also $20 for that appetizer."}]}
