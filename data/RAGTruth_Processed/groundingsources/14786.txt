My mother and I were on a little get away from home (Los Angeles area) and doing some \"thrifting\" in Santa Barbara. We came for dinner but first had a couple of drinks at the bar. My extra-spicy Bloody Maria was very tasteful and not \"watered down\", I was actually able to taste the tequila (YUMMY)! We didn't know that dinner began at 5pm. When we were seated Trish was our waitress. She was hustling with her tables, as there was a 70th birthday party/dinner happening next to us. Even being busy she was still high spirited, kind and generous. She explained to us how the cooking of YOUR OWN steak happens. Yes you cook your own steak and/or chicken. I ordered the 10oz Rib-eye and my mother ordered the Filet Mignon (it comes bacon wrapped). With both our appetizers (crab and shrimp cocktails), our steak dinners, the salad bar, (chorizo) beans, baked potatoes and bread our bill was ..... UNDER $58.00 AND we had our \"doggy bags\" to bring home. Great for dates, family dinners and celebrations. I will be back to bring my husband. It looks like this will be a regular spot to have dinner when we travel up/down the coast."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-01-21 03:44:25", "review_text": "The steak was amazing as usual and the salad bar was so fresh and crisp,but the service is what made our night. We really appreciated our server Trish who \"went above and beyond\"to make our dining experience so wonderful. We told Trish that we were celebrating a special occasion and she brought over a delicious piece of cheesecake at the end of our dinner."}]}
