The one in Paseo Nuevo is super disappointing and I thought this location might be better. It's not much. It is definitely cleaner and has a nicer atmosphere with nicer workers but the food is just not good. It smells and looks good but then you bite into it and it's like eating air with sauce. They rely on the sauce for flavor so they drench it. The chicken is always dry, overcooked, and flavorless, and the bread is stale and flavorless. They give good portions but it really isn't worth the money. It also does take quite a while to get you food no matter if it's busy or not, but I'm pretty understanding of that since I've worked in a restaurant before but for the wait, you would expect it to taste good."}]}
