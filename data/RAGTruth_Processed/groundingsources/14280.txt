My contractor was stuck working late and I wanted to surprise him with an assortment of food, Giovanni's was the first to come to mind, plus, it was an excuse to finally try their pizza. Wow, just wow, the crust tasted like an award winning Chicago pizza joint - only better. We ordered a meat lovers and Hawaiian. I'm not a pizza fan but this pizza is really good. They deliver and next time I walk by Giovanni's, I will actually go in."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-03-01 21:46:42", "review_text": "Great pizza.

Sometimes over the phone ordering causes stuff to get lost in the sauce. Not at Giovanni's on the Mesa.\nThe pizza they made last night was fantastic. So much better than normal commercial pizza.\nIf you want some really good pie, check these folks out.\nPeace and pizzaout,\nAdam"}]}
