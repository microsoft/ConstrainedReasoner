The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is urging residents to take a step towards hassle-free travel within the United States by obtaining their REAL ID. With a growing number of Californians recognizing the importance of this identification, now is the time to secure your REAL ID online.
As of the latest DMV data, approximately 15.5 million Californians have acquired a REAL ID, reflecting an increase of 185,842 in just the past month. This surge in applications highlights the awareness of the benefits this identification offers.
Why is getting a REAL ID crucial? To ensure that your next adventure takes off without a hitch, having a REAL ID is vital.

So, don't let travel plans bloom into a complex ordealâ€”get your REAL ID in advance.
To apply for a REAL ID, the process is made simple for Californians. Just visit the official website, where you can fill out the online application and upload the required documents. The documents you need to provide include proof of identity, such as a valid passport or birth certificate, with legal name change documents if applicable. Additionally, two paper copies of proofs of California residency, like utility bills or bank statements, are necessary, along with your Social Security number (with exceptions that may apply).
By upgrading to a REAL ID, you can ensure your future travels within the United States are smooth and uncomplicated. So, don't delay; make your REAL ID application today and look forward to stress-free adventures in the years to come.
