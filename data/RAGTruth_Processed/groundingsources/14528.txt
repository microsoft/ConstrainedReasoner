The people there were so nice i hate writing this review on their way out, but...\n\nHad the tri-tip on french roll with all the toppings (as suggested by who i'd think was an owner, really sweet lady) and it was BAD.  I mean really bad.  The tri-tip was old and flavorless, the salsa, mayo and mustard combo was a shock to the taste buds that i never want again... \n\n2 stars based on service alone."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2010-09-19 02:26:57", "review_text": "They are closing for good on 25 September. I stopped in today to get my last tri-tip sandwich and smoked ham hocks. \nAll the customers were asking if they'd relocate. They'd like to, but don't have any new place yet. They'll take a break for a while.\n\nIf you like the personal service of a local butcher shop, you've got one week left. Hurry!"}]}
