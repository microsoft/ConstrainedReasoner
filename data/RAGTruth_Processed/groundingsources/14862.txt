Two things made me decide on Soul Cal Smokehouse--the AXXESS deal for buy one food item get the second free, and the AMAZINNGGGGG smell of the meat smoking. Wow oh WOW did it smell amazing and then taste even better. \n\nMy friend and I both got the Pulled Pork sandwich with 1 side of fries. Fries had a garlic and pepper kick to it and we could not stop eating them...despite being full from eating the entire sandwich. Pulled pork was so fresh and JUICY with a rich smokey (I mean has to right?) flavor, topped with coleslaw (which I think had a pickled cucumber  in it?)."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-10-15 00:39:25", "review_text": "Omg!
