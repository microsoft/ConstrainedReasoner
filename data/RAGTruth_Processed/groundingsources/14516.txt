Awesome and clean establishment.  Equipment was always in the best condition and had Lacey as a bartender which was the best in Santa Barbara.  Not a typical pool hall, but a well maintained, well managed establishment that is always a pleasure to frequent."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2012-02-18 17:31:55", "review_text": "Great place if you like watching sports and drinking beer!

I always go to get food, and the drinks are just to go with the food.\n\nFig & Haley, is the place I go for drinking, and the wonderful Brew Co. food is there to set a good base to ensure a long night of drinking.\n\nThey have so many tv's with so many options of channels, it is one of the best places to watch sports in SB. Overall, a 4.5 star establishment."}]}
