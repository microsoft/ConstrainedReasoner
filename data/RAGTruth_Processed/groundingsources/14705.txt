This place has you covered. Office supplies, home decor, home improvement, cosmetics, clothing, cell phones, wholesale alcohol, banks, dining, beer, movie theater, you can find it here. This is an outdoor shopping center with ample parking which does have a tendency to fill up on weekends. \n\nI'm a big fan of this plaza as it offers more than just shopping. You'll find an ice skating rink, a giant multipurpose park, a hotel, electric vehicle parking, and there is a final undeveloped area which will be home to a future gas station. There's also a beautiful fountain on the northeastern corner. This was a whole planned development which I feel has been well executed. \n\nHalf of the businesses here have been around for the better part of 2 decades and seem to be doing well. No matter the time of day, Camino Real attracts all walks of life. I enjoy coming here on Sunday mornings to take advantage of the farmer's market. While mostly commercialized, I do appreciate how there is still a local's vibe to this place. \n\nIf you find yourself in this part of Goleta, park your car and be sure to carve out a few hours exploring this awesome shopping center."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2018-11-04 18:49:34", "review_text": "I really like that place. They have a cool loyalty program that I enjoy. On Tuesdays you can see movies for $6 but AMC has $5 Tuesday. So that's the only minus. I went there with my roommates and we watched a movie together. Good thing about that movie theater is that it's not really crowded."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2015-04-13 05:20:03", "review_text": "Camino Real is an okay shopping center and by no means a destination, unless you want to go to Costco from Santa Barbara.\n\nCompared to other shopping centers in other cities, I consider this one bland in appearance with unremarkable stores.\n\nThere is a nice farmer's market twice a week though and I do like frequenting Costco. The Starbucks is pretty nice as well with multiple tables for outdoor seating. Other than that, Home Depot, Albertson's, Staples, Ross, and many of the other stores are just standard and most of the eateries are disappointing chains.\n\nOddly, \"CAFE ZOMA\" on the other side near Albertson's had been closed for over three years and nothing has replaced it! I look forward to seeing how this shopping center transforms. (A French Press is currently under construction across the street from the center, by Chipotle!)"}]}
