Ordered takeout and got an asada burrito. Easy pickup and was ready when I got there. I was excited to try my food with the good reviews that this place got, but i was left disappointed. The burrito was very bland and the meat was not good quality. Very small bit of meat and a lot of pieces with fat on it. Safe to say there are better options for tacos and burritos."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-28 19:29:10", "review_text": "I randomly stopped by this taco spot on my way back to Pasadena California, I tried an al pastor, chorizo con papas, and Carne Asada taco. All were really good, the homemade tortilla was a good touch, the chorizo con Papa was the best, I would really recommend this place"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-26 23:32:09", "review_text": "Mauricio is the man. The tacos were great. I also like their countertop. We had the carne Asada, shrimp, and house special."}]}
