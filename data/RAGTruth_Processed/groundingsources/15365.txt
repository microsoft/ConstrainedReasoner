{"question": "why does lower back.hurt when i do.leg raises", "passages": "passage 1:This rupture can cause swelling in the area of the disc, which can press on nerves that come out of the lower spine. As your knees bend and you bring the weight down towards you in a leg press, your lower back can round. When it rounds there is a lot of pressure on the discs between your vertebrae. Your back is also being pressed back against the seat because it's supporting the weight of the leg press. This combination of pressure from the weight and from rounding of the lower back can cause a herniation of the lumbar spine.\n\npassage 2:To prove to you that lying or hanging leg raises don\u2019t specifically work the abdominal muscles; let me get you to lie flat on your back as if you were performing a leg raise. Place your right hand at the top of your pubic bone and your left hand on the bottom of your rib cage.\n\npassage 3:If your doctor does a straight leg raise test and you have pain before your leg is at 30\u00b0, then it probably isn't a herniated disc pressing on the nerve. Before 30\u00b0, the nerve root isn't stretched, and it's the nerve root stretching in the straight leg raise test that brings the nerve closer to the herniated disc (if you have one).\n\n"}
