I had their special that was a beautiful roasted chicken with rosemary potatoes and a salad with balsamic and some oil. My boyfriend ordered their steak with rosemary mashed potatoes and spinach. My chicken was flavorful, light, citrusy and tender. I usually don't care for side salads but this salad had fresh greens, and some vegetables that were delightfully soaked in a balsamic and oil, not sure what oil but gosh it was so flavorful, I ate it faster than any side salad I ever had. I also had a bite of my boyfriend's steak and it was juicy, tender and rich in a delightful sauce. A wonderful experience that I hope to taste again"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-01-26 03:35:25", "review_text": "Just came here before close of sbiff... super awesome meal: roost salad and skirt steak.... perfect flavors, doneness and portion...don't just walk by...."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-01-23 03:19:23", "review_text": "We have been to this restaurant several  times now  and each time we are delighted!
