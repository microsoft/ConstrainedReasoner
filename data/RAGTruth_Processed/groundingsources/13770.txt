When I was a line cook, on my day off I would drive the hour from ojai to SB to experience the fantastic service and mouthwatering food at Barbare\u00f1o. Their menu reflects their thoughtful and playful takes on local food history and culture. Everything I've ever ordered here has been a home run and clean plate club situation. I always tell people how perfectly salty their desserts are- that's what I'm talking about with the balance on the tongue. Taking my family out for a special bday dinner here was such a high point in a year where we mostly cooked at home. This is a rare restaurant that is worth experiencing because the layers of flavor and time in each dish would be difficult to recreate at home. Also notably serious beer and cider menu. The only picture I have of their food is a seasonal dessert from 2017- stone fruit sorbet with fried soba. Memorable. Gotta get back here soon."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-30 02:59:21", "review_text": "This place lived up to all the hype! We came while on vacation for dinner. Cozy on the inside and the food is eclectic and plated beautifully. The taste even better than the aforementioned two qualities. We had the Grilled Avocado and Lamb Especial for appetizers, both superb specially the ponzu sauce they hit the avocado with.  For the mains we did a local sea bass in a black garlic sauce and then the trip tip bbq both excellent, fish was perfectly flaky.  All of this said I think their dessert was the best part of the whole meal. We had the hive and honey which was the most unique mix of flavors. They serve it with a panna cotta and a slew of fruits and other honey. It was beautiful to look at but better to eat and might be the best dessert I've ever had. Only thing I wish they had was liquor as it's a beer and wine only but you come here for the food and for that, five stars!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-11-11 04:40:46", "review_text": "Overall, the food was average at best along with the service.\nOrdered catch of the day which was yellow fin rock fish. Had very little flavor, was cool when served and was over priced at $35.00. Nothing comes with it so you have to order a side which was suppose to be grilled veggies but was also not very good and served cold.\nGrilled Avocado was not actually grilled but served cold with way to much sauce.\nBest part was the bread which took forever to get. \nWaiter was average and lost interest when we told him the app was not that great.\nThe patio was very nice and overall atmosphere is good.\nSave your money and go some where else."}]}
