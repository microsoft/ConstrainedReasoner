NHL Player Defies Pride Tape Ban
Recently, the NHL took a step backwards and refused to allow players to use prose themed stick tape and jerseys during warm ups.
Arizona Coyotes defenseman Travis Dermott decided to ignore the ban and played with the pride tape anyway, making Dermott the first player to do so.
Pride Tape, a gesture to support the LGBTQIA+ community, could be seen on the top of his stick during the Coyotes 2-1 win over the Anaheim Ducks.
This past June, the NHL said that players could not use Pride themed paraphernalia during games, kowtowing to players who refused to wear the Night Hight jerseys.
The NHL doubled down on this ban stating before the season started they players could not use any specialty theme night equipment or tape even during warmups.
The NHL, per ESPN has not yet said if they will punish Dermott, and Dermott has not yet heard himself if any punishments are coming.
Dermott has been a supporter of the LGBTQ community saying in a 2021 interview, that he has “some family that is involved in the LGBTQ community. So, I'd like to step forward and in the future take part in supporting them more vigorously."
It does not seem like Dermott plans on stopping. Jeff McLean, one of the co-founders of Pride Tape said that he is still sending shipments of tape to Dermott saying, “He sent me a text to get topped up because he had run out. We're always more than happy to support Travis.”
Longtime GM and NHL personality Brian Burke has been vehemently speaking out against the NHL’s decision to ban the tape. He is on record saying that it:
“This is not inclusion or progress. Fans look to teams and the league to show they are welcome, and this directive closes a door that’s been open for the last decade. Make no mistake, this is a surprising and serious setback.”
Burke has offered to pay the fines of players who choose to keep using the tape.
