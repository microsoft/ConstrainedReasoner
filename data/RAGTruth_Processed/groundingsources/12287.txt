{"question": "similarity and difference between nervous system and endocrine system", "passages": "passage 1:Key Differences. The nervous system is made of neuron cells while the Endocrine System is made of glands. Transmission is performed by the electrochemical pulses in nervous system. On the contrary, the Chemicals known as hormones are responsible for signal transmission in Endocrine System.\n\npassage 2:The nervous system is continuous in which the cells are interconnected. In contrast, the organs of the Endocrine System are not physically connected as they are discrete in nature. The nervous system utilizes the neurons to transmit the signal. On the other hand, the circulatory system is used by the Endocrine System to transmit the signals.\n\npassage 3:What are the similarities between the nervous system and the endocrine system? Both the nervous system and endocrine system are devoted to maintaining homeostasis by coordinating and regulating the activities of other cells, tissues, organs, and systems. Both systems are regulated by negative feedback mechanisms. Chemical messengers are important in both systems, although their method of transmission and release differs in the two systems.\n\n"}
