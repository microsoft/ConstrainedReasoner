I WAS a regular Friday AM pick up of a bagel pack for the office, from when the store opened.  I stopped coming in a month ago or so. The bad service last time I was there was the last straw for me.  Place has gone downhill fast as the new morning \"manager\" was in charge.   I thought my order would be more efficiently handled by doing on an online pick up.  WHAT WAS I THINKING!?  When I arrived for pick up the \"Manager\" didn't have a clue what the print out was for and it was just laying on the counter unattended to.  When I mentioned my paid for order she then said \"Oh that's what that print out is for!\"  She did not apologize and attempted to put the order together.  Too bad she moves slower than molasses! AS THE CLOCK IS TICKING and I AM NOW LATE FOR WORK!   My regular attendant asked if she could help and the manager told her not to.  WHAT A JERK!  Then the regular attendant apologized and acknowledged that she remembers me from my regular visits.  BINGO!!! someone who should be a manager and is not!  This \"manager\"  in the early morning is CLUELESS, does not know a thing about customer service.  I've seen her over the past few weeks looking at her phone, and ignoring anyone walking in---- a complete goof off.  Who chooses management in this place?  The one star goes to my regular morning attendant who \"gets it\".  This location is messed up, and needs a wake up call or closure.  The excuse for customer service from \"management\" here is unacceptable and a major FAIL!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-07-02 17:30:43", "review_text": "Closed as of July 2, 2015. Management let homeless store filthy, stinky bags in the patio out front, Ive seen folks smoking who-knows-what, making it unsavory for any regular employee or tourist on the street to approach the business. \"No Loitering\" would have been a good sign to have out front. They need an original restaurant there, this is Santa Barbara for goodness sake."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-05-14 19:15:43", "review_text": "It pains me to do this but management does not seem to care.\n\nWorking downtown I frequent Panera once in a while for convenience sake. The fact that they allow vagrants to camp on their patio does not make for a pleasurable dining experience.\n\nMonday I witnessed a bearded fella berating his dog for not drinking water. The poor dog was shaking in fear of this guy and if you looked at him the wrong way he'd yell to mind your own business. This guy was taking a four top to himself with all his dirty belongings on the table and chairs. Oh, yeah...the dog was laying on a seat. Not too sanitary.\n\nHe was there again this morning so I went up to Coffee Bean instead.\n\nSorry Panera...you lost me as a customer."}]}
