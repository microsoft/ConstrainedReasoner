Bagel melt, Avocado Toast are favorites. \n\nRecommend: \n1-baristas clean/sanitize outside tables more often\n2-tighten up loose mask policy indoors\n3-SB ordinance does not allow smoking in SB but a homeless guy wearing grey shirt daily smokes in the back which stinks and you can smell it if sitting on the side. Might need to report that \n4-baristas could be friendlier to regulars\n\nLikes: \n1-baristas make great coffee drinks\n2-good atmosphere\n3-great baked goods\n4-outside seating\n\nRecent price increases is a bit heavy. Coffee In a mug was $2.95 now $4!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 17:21:55", "review_text": "To start off the New Year of 2022, I figured I would write a review for a place I regularly visit and appreciate. Given the bags under my eyes and slight fatigue due to being up past my normal bedtime of 9 pm, I could go for a cup of their joe right about now!\nWhile I do enjoy many coffee shops in town, Java Station often has a few perks that places it toward the top.\n- Shorter line for friendly service\n- Better food offerings\n- Decent amount of parking and seating\n- High speed Wi-Fi (not sure how this is possible in town)\n- Welcoming to all (they celebrate Pride, Halloween and beyond)\n- They have games available to play\n- It brings a sense of community to an odd little neighborhood (What the heck is it considered?! Noleta? Or Hope Ranch Annex? ...Now we are just getting particular...)\nI enjoy their Klatch Coffee Co. espresso which is bold without being acidic or underbearing. I often order the Oat Milk Vanilla Latte (yah, I'm basic), yet recently ordered a fall/winter special of Maple Bourbon Latte which I'm a big fan of. I will note that their \"small\" coffee is truly small, so order a medium if in doubt.\nNow that I'm rambling due to a lack of sleep, I will adjourn...until a Review Update comes along!"}]}
