We did some shopping and happened to find this little hole in the wall pizza place. it was kind of hard to find bc their name has changed to cali-forno pizza lol. Andy was so kind, he accommodated us and make a delicious greek salad along with probably the best pizza we have ever had. this review is actually for jaime, our waiter. such a kind hearted amazing soul! he treated my parents and i like we were family. thank you so much, guys! we appreciate the kindness and the hospitality that you show to your customers, we felt so loved and cared for."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-04-14 02:25:50", "review_text": "Randomly discovered this pizza place by walking on park at.
