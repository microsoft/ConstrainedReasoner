This little sushi place is located in old town goleta and it is super fresh and high quality. It is also less of an event than going downtown for sushi so it's more of like an everyday sushi place. I've been here a couple of times and the waiters are always attentive and kind. I would say it's definitely on the same level as Sun sushi!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-10 17:02:06", "review_text": "Best sushi take out in Goleta! We love this little spot!

Did not disappoint. The sushi was delicious! Much better than other places in town that we've tried. To top it off, me and my husband had a wonderful time chatting with the lady that I believe may be the owner? She was so friendly. We always love supporting local businesses!"}]}
