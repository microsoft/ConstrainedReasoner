Football earns first win 19-6 over Tech Boston
( Sept. 30, 2023 ) The football team earned its first win of the season Saturday behind three unanswered touchdowns in the second half of a 19-6 victory over Tech Boston on a rainy afternoon at Vito Capizzo Stadium.
"It was a team effort all-around, just great energy," coach Tim Psaradelis said. "Nobody hanging their head, just battling all-around, all across the board. Anyone who went in just gave everything, it was great." Tech Boston opened the scoring in the first quarter when the Whalers made a goal line stand on the opening drive of the game but fumbled the ball right back to their opponent on offense to set up a one-yard touchdown run. The Whalers defense held strong for the rest of the game and won the turnover battle 5-2 on a day when the rainy conditions made it difficult for both sides to hold on to the football. Anderson Tejada recovered a fumble to set up Nantucket's first score early in the third quarter. After taking over at the 17-yard line, two plays later Brock Beamish rolled out to his left and found Carlos Aguilar wide open in the corner of the end zone for an 11-yard touchdown reception to tie the game 6-6, following a missed extra point. The Whalers took their first lead of the season in the final minute of the third quarter when Angel Cabrera punched the ball in from six-yards out with a strong run as the offense again took advantage of a short-field opportunity thanks to the defense. Arann Hanlon completed the scoring in the fourth quarter with a 30-yard touchdown run where the sophomore took a pitch to the left, broke a tackle and then scampered down the left sideline for the score. Nantucket, now 1-3 on the season, will travel Saturday to Dennis-Yarmouth.
