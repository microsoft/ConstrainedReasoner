I was craving something somewhat healthy so I went with the Teriyaki chicken bowl. I asked for brown rice but they only serve white. the chicken tasted rubbery and they loaded they soaked the bowl with sauce. Even though it was only $6 bucks I wouldn't have spent a $1 on this! The service was extra slow and the staff wasn't friendly. I will not be back."}]}
