Love the indoor/outdoor seating, and ability to bring my lil' dog. Can't go wrong with the happy hour, huge nacho plate, margaritas, queso mushroom and black bean dip. I would definitely recommend for a relaxed night with coworkers, or something like that."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2019-09-14 17:59:50", "review_text": "Loved this place. Great atmosphere and great food. We used to go once a week from opening until recently. They took EVERYTHING we would order and go for off the new menu (plates appetizers and even the desserts) and raised prices. Very disappointing. I'd suggest going to Santo Mezcal for the food with those prices now."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-09-08 15:26:28", "review_text": "Love this new installation to the los agaves chain of restaurants. Highly recommend sitting on the outdoor patio-- they have live music each night which is lovely!\n\nHappy hour is everyday 5-7 which is a great deal, sadly we got there 5 minutes to get those deals!\n\nPortion sizes are big (both of us took home leftovers). I enjoyed the seafood burrito (shrimp and salmon) as a bowl. They did a good job of knowing how to accommodate a gluten and dairy free diet. My husband got the burrito Vicentas a d loved it. \n\nWe also got a tropical margarita and a jamaica margarita (hibiscus flavor) which were both fabulous.\n\nThe only negative was the service went downhill throughout the night. It started out great but towards the end if our visit it seemed like we could never find our waiter and it took way longer than it should for him to return to take care of our bill.\n\nBut all in all I definitely reccomend checking out this restaurant!"}]}
