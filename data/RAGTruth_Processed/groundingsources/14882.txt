There was not a single customer in the shop and 4 employees, wondering around like chickens with their heads cut off? \n\nI told them to immediately get going on my sandwiches, and then once they finally began, it was llike watching paint dry. They took SO INSANELY LONG to make 3 small sandwiches. I've never seen anything like it!?  My 7 yr. old son could shuck a dozen oysters in less time...\n\nManagement needs to either start cracking the whip on these clowns or, just fire them and start over. \n\nUnreal!!!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-02-12 18:45:41", "review_text": "Hubby and I stopped in here to get sandwiches a couple weekends ago.  First thing I noticed was that while no customers were in the store, the employee who was preparing things in the back was wearing his mask over one ear but not over his nose/mouth.  I could see this as I walked in.  The employee didn't notice us right away so I just watched.  Eventually they saw us and put their mask on properly and came over.  Our sandwiches were made correctly and quickly.  Jersey Mike's doesn't put very much meat on the default sandwich though so I recommend ordering double meat.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  Store was clean and easy to find just off the 101.  Down one star for questionable mask-wearing while no customers present."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-10-27 09:34:52", "review_text": "First of all the two young teenage guys that were working we're very polite but when it comes to making sandwiches or food in general it didn't come out so good.\nI got the number 55 the Big Kahuna chicken and I got the biggest size sandwich they had and then I also purchased a sandwich for later.\nThe Big Kahuna chicken was so nasty the chicken was overcooked, it was chewy and dry, when I opened the package to eat the sandwich it was soaking wet with what I'm assuming was the cheese? maybe??\nNeedless to say I ended up throwing it away that was an expensive sandwich to throw away but it was unedible.\nI then tried to eat the sandwich that I had gotten  for later and it was soaking wet there was no reason why it should have been soaking wet.\nI didn't get anything on it  to make it soaking wet no sauce  or any of that.\nThe bread was so soggy and it was only a matter of an hour prior to me opening  it that I had purchased it.\nI had purchased a small sandwich for right then it was tuna I had asked how fresh the tuna was I wanted to see what it look like he grabbed the container ran back in the back and disappeared for a while then came back out and showed me the tuna and when I looked at it I could see he had made fresh tuna and put it on top of the existing I watched him put the fresher tuna on my sandwich but how fresh was that tuna I have no idea because it made me sick.\nI know it was bad because I was nauseous for several hours before the tuna finally came back up.\nMy stomach didn't even digest the tuna which is a good sign that the food was bad when your stomach will not digest it, it knows better.\nSo I was only able to eat the little tiny sandwich which was the tuna and it tasted good at the time I ate it.\nLater when I tried to eat my other sandwich before I was nauseous from the tuna, it was just disgusting I threw it away then I tried to eat my other sandwich that was supposed to be for later it was all soggy it was disgusting also.\nI threw it away also and it was probably a good thing because if the tuna was bad God only knows how bad the other was needless to say I paid about $90 for all of our sandwiches and they didn't even come close to being as good as they looked when they were making them.\nWhen they were making them they looked really good but this is one time looks can be very deceiving!\nThe only reason I'm writing this review is so that I hope nobody else gets sick first of all, and second of all they don't waste their money.\nI had also left a 10% tip on our order.\nAll I have to say is eat cautiously if you eat here\nIf this was the first time I had ever had Jersey Mike's I would never go back.\nSorry for the bad review Jersey Mike's but I felt it should be said."}]}
