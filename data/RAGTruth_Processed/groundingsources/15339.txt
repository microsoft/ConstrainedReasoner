Equating someone's character with the soundness of their argument is a logical fallacy.\n\npassage 3:Poisoning the Well Fallacy. Poisoning the well is an ad hominem attack (see \u201cAd hominem,\u201d above) on a person\u2019s integrity or intelligence that takes place before the merits of a case can be considered. It redirects a discussion to the faults of one of the parties.\n\n"}
