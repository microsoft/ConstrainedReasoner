The service is great, 5 stars for that. \n\nOther dishes we have tired are amazing: chicken parmigiana, ravioli and lasagna... All 5 stars.\n\nHowever, I love my eggplant and let me tell you-I was not sure if it was eggplant or jerky. It was so hard and over fried that I couldn't eat more than a bite. I hate returning dishes, so I just drank tea and took the dish home to throw it away :("}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-16 23:16:45", "review_text": "We love this restaurant.

And then we waited more than twenty minutes for a server to appear. Mask three quarters down his face, and only over his mouth. \n\nGot a half-hearted \"oh, sorry\" when we said we'd been sitting twenty minutes with servers ignoring us. Then lots of rudeness. Claimed to be the manager after telling us there was no manager. \n\nWent to Ca'Dario instead and we're greeted with \"good evening\", and \"welcome back\". And great food and service. \n\nHave been a customer at Arnoldi's for more than eighteen years, but really watched its decline.\n\nJust worth going there any longer when there are so many MUCH better alternatives in Santa Barbara"}]}
