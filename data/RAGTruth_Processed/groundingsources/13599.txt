The cabbage and slaw are served with most dishes we got, and are nothing we ever been offered at other traditional restaurants, but added a modern twist and lots of flavor to what would be a typical authentic dish.  Serving size is perfect. Definitely returning. \nWe had the veggie samosas, vegan dal, fish pakora, shrimp tandoori, vegan potato pancakes, and rice. All was so delicious, we destroyed the dishes before we thought to take photos!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-15 02:28:06", "review_text": "Really really solid Indian food. The fish pakora was the absolute star at dinner, but the saag, both paneer and lamb, were outstanding. Naan was also so fresh and really what Naan should be. And the complimentary Chai is a great, delicious touch. Nice people too."}]}
