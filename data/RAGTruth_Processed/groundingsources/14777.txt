It is in the very popular State street with lots of other busy restaurants nearby. Specifically recommended the full rack of lamb. You will get 8 chops of lambs, one salad or soup, and one another side. Another recommended dish is the sea bass."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-25 19:47:08", "review_text": "It's been years since have returned to Holdrens and take out a few days ago was uniformly good - from the first call to take out, the bacon wrapped shrimp entree w/sides including soup and my lettuce wedge was good.   Overall good experience.    Bread included was pretty good also.  Kudos."}]}
