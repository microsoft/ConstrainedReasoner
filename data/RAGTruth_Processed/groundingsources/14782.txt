They had tempura ice cream, and if you know me, this is one of my favorite desserts because of how it defies logic by frying ice cream in hot oil. Here, the tempura batter was fried nice and crisp which added great texture to the cold smooth green tea ice cream in the interior. This version is an adequate serving of the dish and nothing more.\n\nBeef Sukiyaki is an excellent dish that I rarely find in the Santa Barbara area. The broth here was excellent -- it had a strong soy and mirin flavor as expected and really nailed the taste. But don't be fooled by the large pot because it only contains a few pieces of low quality beef and a few pieces of vegetable and a small bunch of yam noodles. The amount of content in the bowl was very minimal, which is really a shame.\n\nFresh, sweet, juicy uni at Sushi Bar 29! While smaller and more pricey ($16) than Sun Sushi, their uni still hits the quality mark as they are fresh, vibrant, and delicious. Highly recommend everyone to try some fresh sea urchin in their lifetime.\n\nMy biggest problem with this restaurant is that place has both the unpleasant attributes of penny pinching and expensive food. I think it's pretty ridiculous for an upscale restaurant to charge for something as basic as tea, sauce, and condiments if you ask me."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-18 17:48:18", "review_text": "My new \"go-to\" for sushi!
