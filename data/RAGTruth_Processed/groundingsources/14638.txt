Both times the food was excellent and the service good. Unfortunately on sat night abt 7 hrs after dinner I was woken up in the middle of the night with gnarly food poisoning. I almost went to the ER. Now these things can happen anywhere. What upset me even more than that was the response I got when I called the restaurant to tell them in case I wasn't the only one. I was told that it must have come from somewhere else. That food poisoning takes 24-48 hrs. That is utter BS. \nAt no time did this man say he was sorry. I will never go back and I will tell everyone how rude he was. I know lots of people."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2017-04-10 03:43:32", "review_text": "My girlfriend and I came prior to watching a movie on State St. It's located in the heart of Downtown SB... It's ambience and decor is good enough for a casual dinner date, as it has a decent patio with heaters and is well lit inside.\n\nDinner was very very disappointing. Service is 3 stars as our server was a nice guy, but seemed to forget our order as my dish came 30 minutes after the rest of the dishes. He also had to ask and reconfirmed if we ordered specific dishes or not. \n\nFood I would rank 2 stars. The Avocado Salad was way over priced - I could've made the exact same dish at home with ingredients from Vons. The salad was very bland. The Octopus Carpaccio was decent but nothing special. My girlfriend had the steak taco, which was good. The meat was marinated well. I ordered the Seared Yellowtail, and it was horrible. The outside of the fish was dry and the middle of the fish was very very cold. It did not taste fresh at all. I was already upset that this dish took them more than 30 minutes to bring out after everything else, but to add its bland taste and weak preparation really made it worse. Perhaps the worst fish dish I've had at a restaurant in Santa Barbara.\n\nThe only decent thing about this place is its wine selection. Other than that, I'm unsure if I'd give this place a second chance.\n\nIt's sister restaurant the Black Sheep is better. Go there..."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2017-04-08 04:44:33", "review_text": "Have to counter all the 5 star reviews that brought me here during my visit to SB. The food was good. However, I don't think this deserved more than 3 stars. First, the restaurant was half empty on a Friday where most of SB was fully booked. Honestly, there wasn't a great vibe to start with. \n\nAlso, the service was pretty bad for a half empty restaurant. We  had to wait looooong between one plate and the next. It actually took us more than 2 hours to have dinner, most of which was waiting time. Most disappointing was the fact that waiters would disappear for long times before coming back to, for example, ask for deserts.\n\nThe other negative was the portion sizes. We ordered 5 plates plus 2 deserts for 3 people and were hungry although none of us are big eaters. That would have been ok except that we asked our waiter before hand if that was enough and he said it was plenty.\n\nFinally, being in SB, I was very disappointed by the wine menu. Sure, there are a couple of very expensive high-end wines. But, the rest are just ok and way overpriced.\n\nOverall, it is unfortunate that pretty good food turned into a meh experience because of everything that went with it."}]}
