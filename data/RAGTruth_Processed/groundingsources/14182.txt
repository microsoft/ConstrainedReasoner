On the other side with the chips and drinks you can find nail clippers and combs! I didn't ask what they had behind the counter but I bet they had some questionable items for sale back there, hidden from view.\n\nNow, as far as the food. Pastrami was good with a lot of it. Bread was stale and fell apart...bummer.\n\nChicken bacon panini, believe it or not, had too much bacon. \n\nFood is 2 1/2 star. Prices are on the \"low\" side for Santa Barbara @ $7.95 for a big sandwich. So, half extra star for that."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2013-04-30 23:21:15", "review_text": "Dont go!  just got back from there and bit into my cold cut sandwhich and it was horrible.  The bread was dry the spirinkling of bitter iceburg lettuce and soggy tomato just made everything worse.  There is no love in the food at this place.  How do places so bad stay open.  I would never go back if someone even offered to buy me lunch.  my stomach is ont very happy!"}]}
