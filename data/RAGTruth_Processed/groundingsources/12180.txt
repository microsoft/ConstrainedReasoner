{"question": "how does a nash equilibrium differ from a game maximin solution", "passages": "passage 1:If a game has a value, it need not to have a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. In the Von Neumann's Minimax theorem stated above, it is assumed that, for each player, the set of mixed strategy best responses is nonempty given the other player's mixed strategy.\n\npassage 2:Every finite game has a mixed strategy equilibrium. Now, to me, it seems that the Minimax theorem is simply a specific instance of the Nash theorem, for a two-player zero-sum game (the moment an equilibrium is established, the results concerning the game value follow immediately).\n\npassage 3:add a comment |. up vote 1 down vote.
