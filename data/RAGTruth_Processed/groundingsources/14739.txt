The hostesses were very welcoming and gave us an amazing table,  all tables at this place are absolutely gorgeous. Marcus and Manny showed us around the drink menu and suggested some delicious drinks such as the blood orange margarita which was so good.\n\nAdam was an exquisite server and made great suggestions through the night, we tried the Quail which was absolutely delicious, unlike anything we have had before. We also enjoyed the Wagyu which was so tender, moist and delicious. Everything we ate was to die for. The special, which was local Santa Barbara Uni, was absolutely amazing. \n\nThe Meyer lemon tart finished our night in the best way possible. It's is the perfect combination of tart and sweet. \n\nAbove all, best dinner experience I have ever had. The ambience made everything that much better and the food was the best I've ever had. Great service, we felt so taken care of!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-04 00:01:44", "review_text": "Stonehouse at San Ysidro Ranch is where elegance meets surf and turf.  The romantic lights on the patio and classy atmosphere set the stage for the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion or splurge on a night out. The service was immaculate, with a great balance of refined but comfortable. To start the meal, the wine list is extensive at 70 pages but the sommelier provided very helpful recommendations and details on the few we were eying to try. Their cocktails are divine, I personally enjoyed the paper plane with the initial starters of olives and trio of bread. Started off with delicious calamari, which was incredibly tender and flavorful. The sea bass was light and delicate, and the Parmesan crusted halibut was delightfully flaky. To top off a wonderful evening, we were treated to a table side flamb\u00e9 of cherries over velvety vanilla ice cream. Stonehouse is now one of my favorite restaurants for celebrations!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-11 23:32:43", "review_text": "One of the hidden gems of Montecito village with award winning cuisine and alfresco dining that will have you back again not only to explore the menu but to take in the views and sounds of this hidden oasis. An unrivaled dining experience that brings a culinary excellence without having to travel far from our gorgeous coast. Enjoy the seasonal bounty of the west by the fireplace or overlooking the view of ancient olive and citrus trees with lavender fields in the backdrop. I started off with the cheese plate and it was everything I was hoping for. Presentation and taste satisfied my eager palate and when I was done out came a gorgeous yellowtail crudo that was just the right portion and beautifully plated. Could it get any better than this? Of course, and our came the king salmon with all its glory on a bed of spinach. It's simply amazing what creative minds can do with our food. For dessert I had the chocolate crunch cake with a banana latte. And oh what a tasty twosome that was. To elevate your dining experience they're recipients of Wine Spectators grand award so check out their selection from their wine cellar. The service was impeccable and the pacing was on point. And that's my take on this culinary experience, Peace..."}]}
