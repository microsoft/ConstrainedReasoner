Times Square stretches between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, and between West 42nd and West 47th Streets. A subway station at the corner of 42nd Street and Broadway marks the name. Prior to 1904, the area, a busy horse and buggy intersection, was called Longacre Square, after the carriage district in London.
