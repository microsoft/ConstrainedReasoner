{"question": "how to calculate salary hike", "passages": "passage 1:You can find a month-by-month breakdown of U.S. inflation rates for the past fifteen years here. 3. Subtract the inflation rate from your increase percentage. To determine the effect inflation has on your increased salary, simply subtract the rate of inflation from the increase percentage you calculated in Part 1.For example, the average inflation rate in 2014 was 1.6%.. Subtract the inflation rate from your increase percentage. To determine the effect inflation has on your increased salary, simply subtract the rate of inflation from the increase percentage you calculated in Part 1.\n\npassage 2:Regardless of the amount, or if there is a cost of living increase for all employees, there is a standard way to calculate the increase. Step 1. Determine the yearly salary before the increase. This is the annual gross figure the employee received prior to the raise; for example, $50,000.Step 2. Compute the raise based on the percentage or the flat amount given. Percentage example: $50,000 x 4 percent (.04) = $2,000 annual increase.Therefore, the new annual salary is $52,000. The flat amount example would be: $50,000 + $1,500 = $51,500, the new annual salary.or example, say the employee\u2019s annual salary went from $49,000 to $51,000 (an annual increase of $2,000), effective at the start of the prior biweekly pay period.\n\npassage 3:Your employees will also appreciate being told in exact figures what they will now be earning, such as 50 cents more per hour, rather than simply being told a percentage amount, such as an eight percent pay raise. Step 1. Determine the amount of the old salary and the amount that you want to increase it by.For example, if an employee made $18,500 last year and you would like to give her a 10 percent raise, these are the numbers you should use. Always use pre-tax amounts for your salary computations.tep 3. Add that figure to the old salary to determine the employee's new salary. Continuing the example, add $1,850 to $18,500 for a total of $20,350. Step 4. Evaluate the resulting amount to determine if this raise amount is feasible for your business.\n\n"}
