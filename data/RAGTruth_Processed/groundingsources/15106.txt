{"question": "how to bake salmon med rare in the oven", "passages": "passage 1:I usually place the fish into a pre-heated oven at 180C for 15 \u2013 20 minutes. However, the time greatly depends on the thickness of the salmon. I found this great post about how to cook salmon in the oven - http://magazine.siansplan... - helped me a lot, definitely worth a read :)\n\npassage 2:Preheat oven to 350. Heat a medium ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil. Pat salmon dry with paper towels. Season the flesh-side of the salmon with salt. When the oil is hot, add salmon skin-side down. Sear until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Turn and transfer to oven and cook until a cake tester or tip of a paring knife is just warm to the touch when inserted into the middle of the salmon; about 5 minutes for medium-rare and 9 minutes for fully cooked through.\n\npassage 3:3. Brush top of salmon with remaining olive oil and place in oven about 20 minutes, until medium-rare in center. (An instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part should register 100 to 110 degrees.) Remove from oven, and serve with citrus yogurt sauce. For sauce: \u00bd cup drained yogurt. 1 T olive oil.\n\n"}
