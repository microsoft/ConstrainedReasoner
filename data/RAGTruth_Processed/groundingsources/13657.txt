Their sweet potato fries are really good. In my opinion the food is pricey but if your hungry and don't mind spending a bit more by all means yes. But well their service there is sometimes great sometime not so great just depends who takes your order. But the food and view are great."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-08 05:09:40", "review_text": "What's a surprising treat. We were road-tripping and wanted to grab some fresh affordable fish and ended up at Padrino's. Their fresh fish was perfectly matched by the ambiance as you could sit outside close to the ocean. Casual, good quality, and beautiful! Highly recommend!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-29 17:17:46", "review_text": "What an adorable place!!!
