It's probably the furthest from authentic you can get, but authenticity doesn't have a monopoly on delicious! I like it so much I simply haven't tried the other options, though I hear they're good (and pretty authentic). \n\nI would say the consistency isn't the best - sometimes it's a bland or weirdly dry or otherwise \"off,\" but when they do it right it's my second favorite burrito.

The shrimp quesadilla was just too much cheese and greasy.  If that's what you're into then you'll love it.  Probably not the best food choice if you're at all health conscious.  But if you order smart you'll be just fine.  The food is good.  The salsa bar is exceptional.  Fresh everything to suit anyone's needs for whatever plate you order.  You can order a Mexican beer here to go with your meal which is always a plus.  I would recommend, but watch what you order."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2011-09-04 00:10:38", "review_text": "Energy burrito - whole wheat tortilla, grilled chicken, jack cheese & romaine lettuce. \n\nHonestly, the burrito was only okay. If it were for the guacamole sauce, I wouldn't have like it one bit. The chicken was quite spicy (even though it didn't say it was suppose to be spicy) & there wasn't enough romaine lettuce in my opinion. However, each order does come with a side of tortilla chips & the burritos are definitely big enough to feed two!"}]}
