They have a huge TV that they were playing sports on so it was loud.  Otherwise, the place looks cool and has a great vibe.  I think you can also sit out on the patio.  Would eat here again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-02-08 21:41:37", "review_text": "Excellent service great place to slide into for a drink and / or a bite! Burgers excellent always.
