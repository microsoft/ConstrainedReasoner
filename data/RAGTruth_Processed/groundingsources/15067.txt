We were looking for somewhere we could play beer pong and this was it. But the tables were so tall that we had to calibrate for a while. It would be so much better if they had the actual standard beer pong tables and real ping pong balls. The ping pong balls were so soft and made of cheap plastic. It was hard to throw the balls. But drinks were cheap! $10 for cocktails. The cocktails were really good. We had the michelada, spicy margarita, and moscow mule. There's lots of games here like ping pong and corn hole. All the games were indoors. There's an outdoor area in the front to drink. Parking is on the street. Fun time here though! People were friendly."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-16 16:16:32", "review_text": "More like your neighborhood ghetto bar. But in a good way. Lol. Cheap drinks. Like $10 mixed drinks. Beer selection was ok, not a big selection of craft. Lots of games like ping pong, corn hole, beer pong, etc. The issue with beer pong is that the tables are much higher than standard and the balls are made of cheap plastic. So the balls do not go where you intend to throw it. Lol. Very hard to play. But at least it's free and they have normal red cups. All the beer pong is outdoors in the back. Street parking is easy. It's a good time"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-10-03 20:58:27", "review_text": "Cool place to catch a football game, play pong (beer and ping both), shoot some pool, grab some beer and bar food and hang for a while. Super casual and if you're a PBR fan this is definitely the right place for you!"}]}
