{"question": "figure out number of joists needed", "passages": "passage 1:To figure out how much lumber is needed to sheath the floor just simply multiply the width by the length (equals square footage), add 10% for wastage and that\u2019s the square feet of lumber needed. If using plywood square footage divided by 30. Example 30 ft X 40 ft = 1200 SF divided by 30 = 40 sheets.o figure out how much lumber is needed to sheath the floor just simply multiply the width by the length (equals square footage), add 10% for wastage and that\u2019s the square feet of lumber needed.

You use 16 because the floor joists will be placed no more than 16 inches apart.Measure the distance between each floor joist. While the standard distance is 16 inches, the gaps may be smaller.Add these measurements together to determine the amount of lumber you need for the blocking.ou use 16 because the floor joists will be placed no more than 16 inches apart.
