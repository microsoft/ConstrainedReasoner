House Democrat to Join 2024 Presidential Race, Challenging Biden
President Joe Biden's campaign for president in 2024 is now facing an unexpected challenge from within the president's own party after it was reported that a former member of the House Democratic leadership would be launching his own campaign for the Oval Office this Friday.
Now, Biden will have to contend with the campaign of Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who only recently stepped down from his role within the House Democratic leadership, an apparent precursor to his decision to run for the White House.
Biden Faces Internal Challenge
House Democrat Dean Phillips, a frequent critic of President Joe Biden's mostly uncontested primary race for the Democratic nomination for president, is expected to launch his own campaign for the White House, according to reports.
The New Hampshire secretary of state's office says that Phillips is expected to file at 10 a.m. ET tomorrow, which is the deadline for candidates to file in order to appear on the primary ballot in the state.
Expected to be a longshot in the race, Phillips will have to tackle not only facing an incumbent president, something that has been historically difficult to overcome but also fairly low national name recognition, especially in comparison to Biden.
Nevertheless, the challenge will undoubtedly frustrate the Democratic Party leadership, who have tried to discourage people within the party from running primary campaigns against Biden, believing the president is the party's best chance at retaining the White House in 2024.
