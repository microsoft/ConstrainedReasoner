The young woman was very helpful. When I asked about the chocolate-filled crepes, she said they no longer offered them as a standard option, but when I came to pick up the crepes, she had a box of them ready-made for me!\n\nShe gave me very specific instructions for reheating the crepes (in a pan, with SALTED butter). I made a number of fillings (cherry-brandy, sauteed apples with brown sugar and Calvados), homemade whipped cream, toasted sliced almonds, a bought a couple of sauces for topping from Cost Plus, and my friend made some savory fillings.\n\nShe then arranged a self-serve Crepe Bar so people can assemble the combo of their choice. It was a hit and a good way to serve a large group.\n\nI would definitely do this again. When you turn into the parking lot, drive all the way to the end. Their shop is towards the back on the right, on the ground floor.\n\nIt smelled really good when I walked in."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-06-02 19:13:03", "review_text": "I've tried all three varieties.
