Their food was really really good and am really hoping they will relocate maybe. I did find out though the family also runs NAAN  STOP (get it haha) in IV so I will check it out. The food here was really good,fresh ,the people were nice,chai tea good,lunch buffet and dinner was good and they had a little salad bar my favorite part.Santa Barbara maybe upped the rent and drove them out just like all great places here"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2016-07-18 23:32:30", "review_text": "Loved this place but am disappointed (just like others) about its sudden disappearance with NO notice to customers.  Are you temporarily closed?  Closed forever?  How can a business do that without letting customers know?  If they are closed temporarily, it's not a good way to keep a customer coming back.  I don't want to drive over there multiple times to see if they are open or closed.  Very disappointed."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-07-13 00:44:56", "review_text": "Went for dinner on 7/12/16. It looks like the restaurant is closing. So sad. I had a hunkering for good Indian food."}]}
