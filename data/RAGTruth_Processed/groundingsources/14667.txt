But the Yelp reviews were good so we gave it a try. Glad we did! Friendly service as soon as we walked in. Basic breakfast was hot and delicious. I had scrambled eggs (fresh and yummy) with crispy hash browns and sourdough toast. My husband had the veggie scramble (zucchini, red peppers, onion, mushrooms) all fresh and delicious, with the same sides I had. Good cup of coffee, also! We appreciate a hard-working local restaurant and will definitely come back. Four stars just because the ambiance isn't really there. Don't let that stop you from giving this place a try!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-27 01:28:40", "review_text": "We were coming home from a college visit trip to SLO and UCSB and wanted to hit Carp for breakfast. My kid typed in breakfast and this was one of the first that popped up - thank you Yelp!! Mom and pop-type small strip-mall cafe and we loved it. My wife and kids had pancakes (wife added blueberries) with eggs and I had the French toast. A side of hash browns to share (although we probably didn't need it) - just what the road trip ordered. Super friendly and when the people in front of us didn't need menus because the locals know what they want, it is a good sign. Hard working family, but open from 7am-2pm so it might not be a bad gig.... We will stop there again I am sure."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-09 16:17:22", "review_text": "Hugo's Restaurant in Carpinteria is THE best breakfast/brunch spot. I especially love their pancakes, stir fried noodles, and chilaquiles! Their menu is so diverse and anyone can find something to their liking. \n\nThe owners are so welcoming and joyful every time I visit. They have been operating for 20+ years! The service is phenomenal; you never have to wait long for your food. \n\nIf you're ever in the area, this is the spot."}]}
