I got the Italian salami sandwich. Beware, there is quite a bit of unexpected butter there. Overall, very tasty combination of ingredients. \n\nI loved the quinoa and corn soup! It seems homemade since there isn't an abnormally thick texture and too salty. This tastes fresh and hearty. Combo is the right amount of food :)"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-05-03 00:25:49", "review_text": "Fresh, local, easy, and simply delicious. \n\nGrab-and-go salads are very good,  reasonable, and there is a diverse selection. Sesame noodle is my personal fave. Very filling and tasty. \n\nOn the sweet side, they do very well too.  The lemon tart is amazing! \n\nAlso, I'm always on the hunt  for who makes the best chocolate chip cookies in town....For  Santa Barbara,  I nominate these as one of  the best:  full of chunky chocolate chips and a nice sprinkle of salt on top. mmmm!"}]}
