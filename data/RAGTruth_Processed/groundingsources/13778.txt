Need I say more?\n\nYet, there is so much more.  The place is just very comfortable and welcoming, the cook (at least every time I've been there) is a youngish, personable creative genius.  But above all, the burgers are THE BEST IN SANTA BARBARA. Have I mentioned that?"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2011-12-12 23:44:51", "review_text": "As the duchess of this fine establishment (don't argue with me. see the little crown? above this review? yeah. beat it.)... i think its my duty that i provide my favorites to the public. \n\nI'm here every weekend.  Not only because the food is amazing, but because the people that work here are amazing.  Where else can you go where you'll be WELCOMED into a restaurant with open arms? probably a lot of places. forget that I started off updating my review with that question. \n\nbut really though, the friendliness and the warm atmosphere is enough to get people coming back. you feel like you become a part of that small family. \n\nMy brother isn't 21 yet and he never understood why people went to bars. I never go to bars to have a conversation with a bartender (unless its in hawaii and i'm already hammered. then the bartender is my best friend.) but I guess the way that its portrayed in movies where someone goes to the bar and chats up a storm with the bartender is how he thought it was supposed to be.  He still didn't understand until he came in one night with me after work to grub and he instantly felt the hospitality and the warmth of these employees.  please note: this place doesn't have a fully stocked bar. He's just not 21 and thinks that any place that serves beer over a bar-like structure is a bar. Haha, so young and so very innocent. \n\nenough of that. my favorites:\n\npb and j burger. the first time I tried it, I was blacked out and I don't remember what it tasted like at all. I had it this past Saturday night and holy shiiiiiiii-, it was so good. And again, i hate savory and sweet. Maybe my taste buds are slowly changing? Because there have been a lot of these combinations that I'm starting to like... \n\nmacaroni and cheese with mushrooms and caramelized bacon. \n\ngrilled cheese with tomato and arugula. the green makes me feel a little bit better about neglecting my vegetables.\n\nraspberry shock top beer."}]}
