I define it as Kahuna Grill AND it's employee Patrick. The service was perhaps the best service on the planet and the food is insane. Never before have I seen a more perfect employee then my cashier and server, Patrick. His hospitality and amazing service deserves not a 5 stars, but an 100 stars. Looking back on this amazing experience, I don't believe I've ever seen service quite like this. It shocks me that this amazing dining experience only has a 4/5 stars when the service and food was that good. The food came very quick and was the perfect temperature. The food was seasoned perfectly, with the best flavor I've ever tasted. Patrick's laid back personality really shows in his service. He was very chill, while being helpful and professional. Patrick's amazing assistance leads me to believe he deserves a tremendous raise. Looking back on this experience, I am nostalgic. I miss Kahuna Grill but I am also very glad I was able to meet Patrick and eat the delicious food. In my professional opinion, Patrick and this astounding dining establishment is the G.O.A.T (Greatest Of All Time)."}]}
