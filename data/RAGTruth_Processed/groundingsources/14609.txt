Comfy vibe. Idk about the service though. Today was my first time there, and I didn't purchase anything. But the customers I saw come in had a bit of a long wait for their orders even tho there was hardly anyone in the joint. 5 stars tho. I want this place to do well."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-10-23 17:29:10", "review_text": "Terribly slow service - despite the caf\u00e9 being empty on a Sunday morning\nBasic amenties (ie utensils, napkins, etc) - absent \nBroken cr\u00e9pe machine - mildly forgivable\nOverpriced food - basic toast with eggs & a tiny sausage patty will run you over $7\nChum sized melon bites.... what?"}]}
