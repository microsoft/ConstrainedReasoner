Very clean, no rank smell - this is important - and tasteful comfortable furnishings. The stage is very pro w good sound system and lighting. When I went to the bar the server was very friendly and relaxed - I liked that too. Our non-alcoholic drinks were tasty and imaginative and he offered us free refills! Not all the acts were great, but a couple really were good and the in house MC was also a strong performer. We'll be back for sure."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-09-01 16:09:43", "review_text": "I just moved here and this is my first yelp review. I decided to make one and start with a review of Blind Tiger. I've been to 3 different bars since I got into town and Blind Tiger was definitely my favorite. \n\nI came on with one of my girlfriends on Saturday. There was a $10 cover but the accommodating staff and great crowd made it all worth it. Brandon was so informative and fun and made our entire experience memorable. \n\nWe will definitely be back to dance and party with everyone!!!!"}]}
