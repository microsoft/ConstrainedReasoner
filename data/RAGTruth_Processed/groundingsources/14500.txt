Late last year there was change of ownership and the food completely changed.  All the sauces are different, and they are all pretty bad now.  I used to get their Vindaloo, but now it is inedible.  Unfortunately, there are no more Indian food restaurants in all of Santa Barbara worth going to.  The only local Indian food worth a damn is in Goleta next to KFC."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2014-05-09 12:39:12", "review_text": "Good food (they'll assume you want it mild, if you're a spicy fan, ask). Great service. \n\nSamosa, lamb curry, cauliflower and spinach curry all well done."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-05-05 04:17:54", "review_text": "We stopped by on our way back to LA. It doesn't look like much from outside, but we loved the food. My husband and I are vegan and they were very accommodating. Someone next to us left a jacket and the server ran down the street to get it back to her. Just a nice atmosphere and vegan friendly."}]}
