HS FOOTBALL: Mahanoy comeback falls short at Marian, Bears fall 21-13
HOMETOWN – From being down 21-0, Mahanoy Area had multiple chances to come out of Hometown with a storybook comeback, but could never capitalize.
The Golden Bears entered Saturday’s game with a 1-4 record as they visited the 3-2 Marian Catholic Colts.
The Colts struck first via a one yard run by senior fullback Jesse Rodino with under 7 minutes left in the first.
Freshman running back Rory Dixon would find paydirt later in the first on a four yard run, set up by a long pass from senior quarterback Bruce Hopeck to senior receiver Brandon Klitsch.
Another short-yardage run by Dixon — who amassed 100 yards on the ground — would give the Colts a 21-0 advantage with 7:30 left in the second quarter.
Cue the start of a Golden Bear comeback.
With seconds left in the half, junior quarterback Levi Terry found a receiver Austin Green in the endzone to score.
Halfway through the third quarter, senior running back Colm McGroarty punched it in from a yard out. With a failed point after, the Bears were down 21-7.
A fumble on the ensuing Marian drive gave the Bears a chance to tie it up, but Marian’s defense kept them at bay for the remainder of the game.
The Colts secured the victory 21-13 to move to 4-2 as the Bears fell to 1-5.
Mahanoy Area moved on to face Williams Valley at Stauffenberg Field at Viking Stadium in Williamstown next Friday, while Marian faces Shenandoah Valley.
