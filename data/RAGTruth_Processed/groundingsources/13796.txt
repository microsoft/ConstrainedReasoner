It offers great curb appeal and the single-story interior is surprisingly large. The entire block is a gentrified section of downtown Santa Barbara and I enjoy how well-kept it is. I also enjoy how the mid century tile mural of Santa Barbara's history (from the Vons that used to be in the location) was preserved and added to the western facade. If you look at it from left to right, it depicts a whimsical timeline of how our city came to be. \n\nThis venue was originally more of a market with the actual grocery section in the front. I assume that when it was removed, the focus was to shift to food only. Either way, I feel that the place has evolved nicely although there have been noticeable speed bumps along the way. \n\nWhile this place always seems to have a few empty storefronts, those that do occupy the space are of quality. I'm a big fan of Empty Bowl and Fala Bar. Both offer exceptional food. There's also a great sushi spot though I've never tried for myself. A kitchen area in the rear was built to be a rentable commercial space. There is ample seating throughout and the market as a whole is very clean. There always seem to be janitorial staff working while I'm here. \n\nI look forward to seeing the SBPM further evolve."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-24 16:01:14", "review_text": "This is a lot like San Pedro square in San Jose.  A large building with several restaurants.  There's a huge bar that's playing sports.  Soccer was on when I was there.  They have pizza, tacos, sushi, wine and more.  Nice place for a meal or hanging out."}]}
