The sausage, country potatoes and eggs over easy were all great tasting. The sausage was fresh tasting with great flavor. The potatoes were seasoned with spices I couldn't name, but I know good food. My orange was a nice compliment instead of coffee. However, my partner had coffee. There was no bread product that came with the meal, but since the restaurant also has a bakery there were lots of yummy choices. I ordered a chocolate eclair as a special breakfast dessert. The cream was thick and delicious on the eclair. It was way too much to eat, so I had some left over for later.\n\nThe negative comments I have is that food was ordered at register and NO cash payments. One waiter/bus person for entire restaurant, so coffee refills were slow and waiter/bus person had to be flagged down for refills.\n\nLastly, I liked the options of where to dine. Indoor or outdoors. We chose the outdoor table under an umbrella. It was perfect!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-15 14:24:48", "review_text": "Walking State St for the first time and ran across Andersen's.

But after we sat down, my wife went to the restroom. To her surprise, there was poop on the floor that she accidentally stepped on. When we brought it up to the staff, we were brushed off. No apology, no nothing. I know the area has a homeless problem, but that should push management to keep the restaurant clean. Totally disgusting."}]}
