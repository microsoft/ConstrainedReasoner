Super filling, enough for 2 meals. I love their green salsa, its just enough spicy to make you sweat but enough flavor for you to keep adding it to your food.\n\nThe owner is really sweet! and the ambience is nice. A great place to check out!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-05-28 20:01:08", "review_text": "Service was excellent and really clean location.

I enjoyed it than all the other burritos in IV. The chicken was flavorful, everything was warm. It hit the craving spot. \n\nSecond time, ended up getting a steak burrito with the works. Not for me. Steak was chewy and made the burrito less enjoyable. Haven't been back since but I will give it one more chance when I get a burrito craving (but I haven't craved a burrito since)."}]}
