I ordered a #1 on gluten free bread.  The meat was plentiful and delicious, the veggies were fresh and the options are vast for a sandwich shop.  The gluten free bread was Udi's and definitely needs improvement.  There are many gluten free bakeries nowadays that Udi's shouldn't even be a consideration unless it's to make croutons; it's dry, falls apart and lacking taste.  However, the size of the sandwich and the vast menu, I'm still giving them 4 stars."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-09-24 18:19:56", "review_text": "I have been eating here for years with pretty consistent service and quality.
