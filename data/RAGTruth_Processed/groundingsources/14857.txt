We were served by a young man who nearly managed to individually make a rude comment to every person in our party of eight. As a person who works in food service myself, I know large parties can be sometimes challenging and extra work to deal with, but we were all very polite to our server and we were expecting to leave him a large tip for his time. However, he continuously made people in my party feel bad for asking questions about menu items etc. I personally ordered a salmon roll that I thought came with cream cheese as it was listed with cream cheese on the menu, and when the roll did not come with cream cheese I asked our server if it was possible for me to have a side of it with my meal. He proceeded to ask me if I was certain I had ordered my roll with cream cheese, and when I said I thought so he disagreed with me and told me that he \"had a pretty good memory\". Flustered I said that I was fine and didn't need any, and he eventually said \"well if that's what you want\" and left. I am so disappointed in Kyoto sushi because I have been here before and so enjoy the delicious menu items every time I go, but after this encounter I will not be coming back. Given that there was an automatic gratuity for the tip, there was no way for our party to express our distaste in the rudeness of our server. Working in food service myself, I know the job can be tiring and difficult, and I really try to understand the perspective of the worker. But my party did absolutely nothing wrong, and I personally would never have treated a customer in the rude way we were treated."}]}
