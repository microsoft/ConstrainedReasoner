It has all the things I look for in a theatre and it is no surprise that celebrities come from all over the world to partake in the Santa Barbara Film Festival! \n\nOffers fabulous shows, CHECK!\nGorgeous design and history (look up inside), CHECK!\nClose to plenty of dining/drinking options, CHECK!\nEasy nearby parking, CHECK!\nSafety protocols for attendees, CHECK!\n\nI recently came to the Lobero Theatre to see one of my favorite comedian drag queens, Bianca Del Rio. The staff kept everyone safe by requiring proof of vaccination, had everyone converse with masks and social distancing on the foyer prior to the show, provided visible signs indoors announcing expectations, and had a bar outside! We had a wonderful time that evening. I would have no hesitation to return for one of their wide-variety of shows or performances."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-21 16:51:10", "review_text": "Another great show at Lobero! They enforced covid protocols by checking vaccination cards and monitoring mask wearing, which I appreciated.  Sound was great. I love seeing acoustic shows here and there's really not a bad seat in the house at this small venue. They also pour a good drink at a decent price during pre show and intermission."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-19 06:10:20", "review_text": "Smaller but stately theater. \n\nI've had the opportunity to come to The Lobero several times over the years for various plays and symphonies. It's at the base of Santa Barbara's theater district and is probably among the oldest. I believe that this particular theater had survived the 1925 earthquake. It still stands tall to this day. \n\nWhile there is no upper mezzanine area, The Lobero does feature a large amount of seats. The lobby and theater are adorned with ornate wall and ceiling decor. It's as if you've stepped back in time 100 years. The venue is well-preserved and shows like a real gem to this day. \n\nOverall, a great theater with some awesome headliners. I look forward to coming back soon."}]}
