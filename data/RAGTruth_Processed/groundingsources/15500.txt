{"question": "what to do if your baby is throwing up", "passages": "passage 1:After the first few months of life, the most common cause of vomiting is a stomach or intestinal infection. Viruses are by far the most frequent infecting agents, but occasionally bacteria and even parasites may be the cause. The infection also may produce fever, diarrhea, and sometimes nausea and abdominal pain.\n\npassage 2:Baby Throwing Up. New parents tend to get worried about sick children. Young babies are very delicate and can get sick pretty quickly. The worst thing is that parents have no idea what to do when their baby does get sick and starts throwing up. For young babies, throwing up is nothing unusual.\n\npassage 3:If your child has just vomited, wait 30 to 60 minutes before giving fluids and then start with small amounts. Avoid giving your child solid food for the first 24 hours after the vomiting starts. Instead, give him clear fluid in small, frequent doses (every 5 minutes) by spoon or bottle. You can also have your child suck on ice cubes or cold, wet washcloths. Older child can sip their drinks through a straw.\n\n"}
