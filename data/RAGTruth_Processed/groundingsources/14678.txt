They only had 3, and they were absolutely massive.  Something that you would buy for a huge party you would host.  But because there weren't any other options, we had to settle with 1/2 a cow.\n\nWe got some fresh corn, which was super sweet, and some potatoes, ranch beans and misc other items.  \n\nThe store was very clean, and the check out attendants were very pleasant and accommodating for when we were running back and grabbing things during checkout."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-07-24 04:32:54", "review_text": "Best apple fritter I've ever had.
