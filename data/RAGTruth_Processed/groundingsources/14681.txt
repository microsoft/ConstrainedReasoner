While other pool halls have come and gone, Don Q has endured - I think they still have the same 70s-80s rock playlist in the jukebox. They have the highest quality tables and cloth, both bar and regulation size. It's fun and comfortable with the kids, a date, your wife or the guys - never feels seedy or uncomfortable. The beer and snack selection have increased greatly over time, and are downright over the top now. My only wishes: that they still had scoring beads for straight pool, some chalk cones, and didn't require the felt pad under the cue ball at break. Nonetheless, Don Q is the absolute best place to play pool in SB."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-10-23 23:15:31", "review_text": "this place is not a real billiards hall. the felt on all the pool tables is in  bad shape & when u ask the owner about it he'll just be rude.! stiix in ventura is where u have to go to play on real billiards tables. the only reason they r still open is because the kids know they can drink there !"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2019-04-22 04:55:17", "review_text": "The management at Don Q is probably the worst we've ever encountered in any business venue. We visited there after speaking to someone over the phone to discuss a possible opportunity for a large party event. The venue was relatively full but not overwhelming and the individual in charge couldn't take even a minute to talk to us complaining he was too busy; and, he even avoided us even though we waited for a possible 5 minutes of his time. \n\nAlong side this extreme rudeness, the venue allows outside food to be brought in. It wreaked of uncovered food throughout the place. Food on every counter and bar stool. Quite gross. \n\nI have to say I will never visit Don Q's again. Management is the rudest I've ever encountered and the place smells. They have a lot to learn about running a business and they missed out on a lucrative opportunity."}]}
