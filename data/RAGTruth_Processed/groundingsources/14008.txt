There was only two people in front.\nWe ordered two bento boxes and edamame. We got the boxes fast but my fiances was wrong. The girl took it back without giving me any utensils. We finally got my utensils and his food and she walked away without giving him utensils.\nWe also purchased edamame, reminded the girl and still never got it. (We did get a refund for that).\nBut while I was waiting for 10 minutes for the refund, 1 person came up to say 3 things were missing for their order and another woman came up saying her teriyaki was cold. There was also a ridiculous amount of togo orders that they were super behind on.\n\nThe manager/ owner needs to pay more people to work. I dont know if someone just called out or they are extremely under staffed but be careful coming here on a rush."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-04 23:17:23", "review_text": "My sushi was served hot...I think that's enough said.\n\nI ordered the dynamite roll and it just wasn't good. I understand this is americanized sushi but the scallops were overcooked and it was covered in a heavy layer of spicy mayo. For $15, it's really not worth it. Spend your money elsewhere."}]}
