Such an enchanting space, and perfect for socializing amongst the beautiful people of Santa Barbara.\n\nThank you Shannon and Alberto for taking such good care of us all. Shannon's drink recommendations were spot-on for all of us. \n\nDefinitely our new favorite chill and cocktail place in the Funk Zone. And thoroughly enjoyed the fun music selections."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 00:58:46", "review_text": "Such a fun idea. We really hope they do another.
