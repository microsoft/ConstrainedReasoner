When we went to pick it up, they hadn't even checked for the order, so the person picking up for us had to stand there and wait. Get home, order was shorted one sandwich. Went back and the staff was so utterly rude it was unbelievable. The woman behind the counter insisted that she packed four items, but as i just said, there were five. We ordered two of the Italian sandwich and we were shorted one of those because they probably didn't read the order carefully. So the woman made the second sandwich, then practically threw it at our picker-upper. Seriously? He wasn't rude to her or anything, and while we would have just chalked it up to an oversight, the deli worker who unloaded on us made everything worse. Food was fine, but the service today means we are no longer customers. Yikes! Happy freaking holidays."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-10-14 20:16:52", "review_text": "What happened, Cantwell's? You used to be the go to for big tasty sandwiches?

The people behind the counter were friendly and efficient. The perfect place to grab a bite or a bottle of wine."}]}
