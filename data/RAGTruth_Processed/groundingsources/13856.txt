Aurora Police Chief Issues Statement Following Elijah McClain Verdict
Aurora Police Chief Art Acevedo issued a statement shortly after a jury delivered a verdict for two Aurora Police Department officers who were accused of criminally negligent homicide in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old unarmed Black man who was subdued by police and injected with ketamine by paramedics.
â€œI know many have been waiting a long time for the involved parties to have their day in court, Chief Acevedo stated in a post on X. "As a nation, we must be committed to the rule of law. As such, we hold the American judicial process in high regard. We respect the verdict handed down by the jury, and thank the members of the jury for their thoughtful deliberation and service. Due to the additional pending trials, the Aurora Police Department is precluded from further comment at this time."
As reported by CNN, a jury found one of the officers on trial, Randy Roedema guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the case. However, the jury found the other officer on trial, Jason Rosenblatt, not guilty of the charges against him, including reckless manslaughter and assault.
During the trial, Roedema's attorney had argued that the officer was justified in using force to subdue McClain as he was resisting arrest. The attorney noted that McClain was given 34 commands to "stop" or "stop fighting," CNN reported.
On August 24, 2019, Aurora Police Department officers responded to calls about a "suspicious person" walking with a ski mask. McClain, a musician, massage therapist, and animal lover was walking home from a convenience store where he had purchased an iced tea when the confrontation happened. Police placed McClain in a carotid hold, and he was later injected with ketamine. He suffered a heart attack on the way to the hospital and died three days later, the CNN report noted.
A third officer and two paramedics have yet to stand trial for their roles in McClain's death.
