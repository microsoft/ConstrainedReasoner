She Knows Soaps reports that Luna wants to help RJ Forrester (Joshua Hoffman) and take the burden of this heavy secret from his shoulders.
On Friday's episode, B&B revealed that Luna is Li Flannigan's (Naomi Matsuda) niece. Her mother warned her to stay away from the Forresters. She appeared to want to protect her daughter from heartbreak. She could be a long-lost Forrester somehow. However, we have yet to learn how.
