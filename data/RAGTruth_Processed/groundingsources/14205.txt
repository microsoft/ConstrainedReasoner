The staff is very nice and helpful. I went for the soft opening and while it wasn't perfect, they did all they could to make the service amazing, and it worked. They also serve Mala Tang, which I tried, and it was really good. The medium spicy is exactly as it sounds like. They also have other items I haven't tried yet but I will definitely go back for more!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2020-02-25 08:58:42", "review_text": "A bit pricey for just a simple dumplings n malatang ( the spicy soup) ... But it taste good... Just not worthy to go back again."}]}
