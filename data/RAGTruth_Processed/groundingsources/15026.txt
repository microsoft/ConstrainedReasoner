Bevmo probably carries it. \n\nI'm consistently in awe over just how much of a selection this place offers. It's very reminiscent of an ABC liquor store on the East coast where you feel as though you're in the king of them all. \n\nThis location is typically clean and quiet, with a good number of staff present. They are happy to recommend items for you if you're on your way to an event or are in the market for a gift. \n\nI'd recommend acquiring one of their frequent customer cards (which pair with your phone number, too). With the card, you'll be eligible for some awesome discounts. I love their penny wine sale, among other amazing members-only perks!\n\nGive this spot a try!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-06-13 07:23:57", "review_text": "Cashier on duty was super vigilant about keeping masks on which could be viewed many ways.  Found the wine selection to be pretty limited, bit they did have a rarer Amarone della Valpolicella wine from Italy.  We eventually won the girl over at the end when my dad tipped her for keeping us COVID safe -- this location was semi #declawed on cold White Claw, but they did have plenty on the back wall.  One of the smallest BEVMO's I've ever visited."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-06-13 02:34:04", "review_text": "Although, the lady in charge was nice and sweet, Adam has horrible service which is why I gave 1 star. Not very helpful at all, questioning the price of the items in the store as if I was lying, boxed my own items because I felt like he didn't want to, I should've just rung myself up to relieve him of his misery"}]}
