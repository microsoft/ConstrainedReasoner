We both had the chicken piccata--my husband without changes and me with veggies instead of pasta (avoiding gluten). It was delicious with big chunks of tender chicken and (in my case) a fabulous side of sauteed mushrooms, artichokes, zucchini and red peppers in olive oil and garlic. Fresh bread and olives were provided. Friendly, prompt service and nice wines. We will definitely be back."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-03 22:01:00", "review_text": "Had an amazing lunch here when we pulled off onto Santa Claus Lane. Actually stopped to try another place but it looked busy, loud, and boisterous. This was perfect.  We sat on the quaint, comfortable patio and enjoyed the great food and service.  Appreciated the complimentary olives and had the bruschetta appetizer and pizza. Good wines.  So, so delicious.  Highly recommend."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-21 00:19:19", "review_text": "There are restaurants and then there are special places. Eateries that evoke memories, the personal past, places where you are just not enjoying a great meal but you feel comfortable like you are in somebody's home or a long ago family place,  perhaps a visit to a little French or Italian village cafe while driving through the European countryside where nobody is rushing you away from your table. And the food, well, that's a wonderful surprise in itself whether it's the fairly traditional Italian dishes with a slight twist here and there, or the imaginative real transformations of tradition, like the truly marvelous Brisket Pizza!! I kid you not. I have never seen a pizza disappear so quickly as the night 5 of us were there with at least four other dishes. It starts with an incredible chewy thin crust, Gorgonzola cheese, caramelized onions. and real beef brisket ( like my mother used to make!) or their Chicken Fettuccini which unlike many other recipes is light and delicate . They have wonderful appetizers a number of which have delicate pastry and are stuffed with spinach and may have salad on top. The delicate touch is due to the delightful Belgian/French chef Thais. Leave room for the best chocolate mousse you ever tasted, or the tiramisu or creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Mario your host and  co-owner with his chef wife at Thario's Kitchen makes you feel right at home."}]}
