As SB locals we've eaten here many times and always enjoyed the food and service. Our private event was no different and all our guests raved about the food. Through multiple delays and schedule changes due to COVID, Patrick was always accommodating and helped us put together a special evening that we will always remember. At the event, all his staff were friendly and on top of everything. Thank you Patrick and the whole State & Fig team!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-29 23:47:58", "review_text": "My boyfriend and I have been here a few times and it's always a great experience! COVID is tough on businesses these days and changes aren't always the best. We were skeptical paying at the counter since service typically suffers that way, but not here. Our server Riley was so hospitable and anticipated our needs before we could even ask. We had a few mimosas and had ZERO trouble getting another round thanks to Riley's impeccable service. He made the end of our trip a pleasant one! \n\nOnto the food: my boyfriend ordered the Presidio Burrito (he's tried it twice) which was delicious. It was generously filled with chorizo, home fries, cheddar and jack cheese, avocado, and salsa. It's paired with a side salad that's pretty tasty as well. For myself, I tried the Salmon Benny that was paired with a side of home fries. The entree was good, but the burritos here are definitely better. \n\nDrinks: this establishment has pretty good coffee whatever brand they use. Flavored creamer isn't necessary. We also had a few rounds of mimosas which are pretty darn good for $6 apiece. They have a variety of flavors to choose from too - peach, guava, pomegranate, pineapple and mango (my favorite). \n\nIf you're in SB, definitely give this place a try. Your tummy will thank you."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-11-27 01:55:00", "review_text": "We really wanted to like this place, but it fell sorta flat.  While the server was very nice, the food not so much.  For the price, the chicken panini was small and basic.  Flavor was something I could have made at home.  Same for the salad.  It was a very small portion of salad greens.  I also ordered the Sausage Kale soup.  It smelled great, but since we eat with our eyes first, I could not get past the layer of thick floating grease/oil on the top. I could not eat it.  That layer of fat needs to be removed.  I understand fat is flavor, but this was too much."}]}
