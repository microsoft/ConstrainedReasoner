But Pick up Stix is the best you can get in under 5 minutes. While their portion sizes tend to be under-whelming, their ingredients and general tastiness is a good compromise to the pig slop served elsewhere. This particular location is usually pretty clean and generally has friendly staff.\n\nIf you are in a hurry, stop by Pick Up Stix for some decent food."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2010-02-22 17:55:02", "review_text": "Went to this place for the first time the other day.  It's sooo good! For a place that cooks fast, it's way better than panda express!  \n\nShrimp fried rice and honey chicken was what I got...and you get your moneys worth! and then they have a dollar menu too, hahaha. They have egg rolls on it, wontons, edamame, dumplings!  The food is bomb!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2009-09-16 05:27:21", "review_text": "Kung Pao Chicken w/ Fried Rice for Mom. Pad Thai Chicken & Shrimp for me. $16 dollars, no drinks. Why did I wander away from my normal order? The pad thai was...ehhhh so-so. Kung Pao was pretty good, Rice was gross. Took 15 mins to get the food and no one was in there. I've had it before when I would have given 4 stars. Won't be rushing back."}]}
