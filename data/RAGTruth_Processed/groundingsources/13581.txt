California man sentenced; Defrauded feds of $3 million in pandemic relief money to buy gold overseas
A Glendale man, Arman Nikogosyan, was sentenced to 78 months in federal prison today for his involvement in a conspiracy to launder at least $3 million in fraudulently obtained unemployment insurance benefits, a scheme that unfolded during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced Monday.
United States District Judge John F. Walter handed down the sentence, along with a restitution order requiring Nikogosyan to pay back the full $3 million.
Nikogosyan, 45, had previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to launder money on March 27, admitting his role in the operation.
The conspiracy began in 2020 and continued until December of the same year. Nikogosyan played a pivotal role in the money laundering operation, which revolved around fraudulent unemployment claims, prosecutors said.
His co-conspirators applied for UI benefits in the names of unsuspecting individuals and utilized debit cards issued by a major bank to withdraw the fraudulently obtained funds.
As a result, Nikogosyan was designated to receive the cash proceeds generated from this fraudulent scheme.
With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to Congress expanding the amounts, duration, and eligibility for UI benefits in 2020, the Employment Development Department in California administered the program.
Nikogosyan was well aware that the funds he was handling constituted the proceeds of this fraudulent activity, and he took deliberate steps to obscure their source, ownership, and location, prosecutors said.
To achieve this, Nikogosyan used assumed names, including those associated with shell companies, to have the illicitly obtained funds deposited.
Subsequently, he transferred these funds abroad and invested in gold, creating an added layer of complexity to conceal the origin of the funds.
Throughout the course of the conspiracy, Nikogosyan laundered a minimum of $3 million in fraudulently obtained proceeds, according to prosecutors.
Much of this money was delivered to him in cash by his co-conspirators. In a pivotal development, law enforcement agents seized $194,497 in cash from Nikogosyan's residence in December 2020. This money was identified as proceeds from the fraudulent scheme, further substantiating his involvement.
