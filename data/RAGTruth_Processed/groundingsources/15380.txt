{"question": "what does phenol do to the body", "passages": "passage 1:Phenol is highly corrosive to the skin and readily absorbed. through it, whereupon it can affect the central nervous system and cause. damage to the liver and kidneys. It is also a mutagen, and there is some. evidence that phenol may be a reproductive hazard. When heated, phenol will produce flammable vapors that are highly toxic. (at just a few parts per million) and explosive (at concentrations of 3% to 10%. in air).\n\npassage 2:Larger amounts of phenol will enter the body when large areas of skin touch weak solutions of phenol than when small areas of skin touch strong solutions of phenol. If a person is exposed to air that contains phenol, phenol can enter the body through the skin and lungs.\n\npassage 3:This public health statement tells you about phenol and the effects of exposure to it. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identifies the most serious hazardous waste sites in the nation. These sites are then placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) and are targeted for long-term federal clean-up activities.\n\n"}
