I got the combo #3 which had 8 dumplings, 4 chicken wings, and a soda. I got the 3 flavor dumplings (chives, pork, shrimp) and I thought they were so tasty. If you dip the dumplings in the chili oil sauce mixed with soy sauce, it really brings out the flavor. However, I thought the chicken wings would have been juicier and had more flavor, but they tasted really plain. I was disappointed for sure. \nMy friend got the combo #2 which had 8 dumplings, spiced beef, and a soda. The spiced beef looked and tasted dry but she said the celery and beef dumplings were good too.\nI'm actually surprised how full I got off that one combo though."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-09-01 06:19:27", "review_text": "If you want quick, easy, and yummy dumplings near UCSB's campus or just in SB or Isla Vista, Dumpling King is the place for you! The service could be better but that's how you know it's authentic. Also, it's family-owned!\n\nThere's lots of booth seating in the back and you can look into the glass cases to see all of their offerings. Their prices are great and I'd recommend you get dumplings to-go for later to keep in your freezer!\n\nI got quite a few pork and shrimp dumplings to-go on a travel day. Great prices and value, and the dumplings were just very tasty too!\n\nThey also have chicken wings, skewers, and some soups and noodles."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2019-08-28 00:17:06", "review_text": "Food: best dish = three flavors dumpling (shrimp, pork, chives). Beef dumplings were just okay. Fried chicken was kinda gross with lots of hair still on the chicken\n\nService / atmosphere: non-existent... when it's not rush hour you feel like you're in the owners' living room, because they chat on the phone loudly and yell at you from the counter when your food is ready\n\nIf I came back, it would only be to get takeout of the three flavors dumplings"}]}
