I went all the way home and had to come back and they made the exact wrong thing again. I asked for a refund and the cashier was wrong about price and said SO !! WHO HIRES THESE MORONS ? Rudest food service worker I've EVER encountered. He kept saying give me the receipt after HE threw it away the first time they screwed up. Contacted management and they didn't even respond ! Place was also very dirty. My advice is DON'T GO TO THIS GARBAGE TACO HELL"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-09-25 03:45:40", "review_text": "Would give more stars if customers service wasn't trash.
