I would've never expected this to be a business that served pho and banh mi if I just drove by it, but I'm glad curiosity got the best of me and I'd like to try this place more often. \n\nI ordered half a pork banh mi with everything on it and it was reminiscent of the Vietnamese spots in the east bay suburbs. My only complaint is their bread isn't as flaky and it's more soft and dense, but it does the job for a craving. They didn't skimp out on the pork which is good. \n\nThe lady running the counter was really nice and I got my sandwich way faster than I'd expect anywhere else in this area. Worth it!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-03-15 18:18:55", "review_text": "Freshest sandwich in town. The bread is so soft and the ingredients are so fresh. Never greasy, light yet filling. So delicious! My favorite is the pastrami, it's the Wednesday special. If you like your sandwich with everything make sure you let them know or they won't put condiments on it. Must try!"}]}
