As a chain restaurant, the quality of food usually remains the same throughout different branches. The food comes out hot. The beef and chicken and marinated like how they usually are. There are no surprises. \nHowever, the service here is a lot better than other places. The cashier (an old Asian woman) works hard to memorize names of regular customers and to properly type up the names of customers correctly. She asked me twice how to spell my name and after I got my order, she asked me again. I can tell she really cares about her role as a cashier and taking names down as the customer wants it. Thus, the service is amazing and worth coming here rather than other fast-food places on campus."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-06-17 18:23:22", "review_text": "This place is my go-to when I'm working and hungry. I used to get the combo bowl which comes with rice and steamed vegetables, along with angus beef and steak but now I get the combo bowl with bbq ribs and the grilled tilapia. The grilled tilapia is delicious with lemon and white rice with soy sauce. It's quick, easy and good"}]}
