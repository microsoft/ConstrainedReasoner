{"question": "how long would it take to fly 370 miles while flying at 100 mph", "passages": "passage 1:Air Speed / Ground Speed Taking a 60 mile long road trip by car, the driver is fairly sure that if the average speed is 60 miles per hour (mph) for the trip, then it will probably take approximately one hour for the trip (60/60 = 1).\n\npassage 2:Calculations. Air Speed / Ground Speed Taking a 60 mile long road trip by car, the driver is fairly sure that if the average speed is 60 miles per hour (mph) for the trip, then it will probably take approximately one hour for the trip (60/60 = 1). This would not be as certain with an airplane because of wind.\n\npassage 3:This problem is easily solved using ratios: Traveling at 70 MPH = 70 miles / h = 70 miles / 60 minutes = 1.66667 miles / minute = 0.8571 minutes / mile. Thus, at that rate, to travel 30 miles = 30 miles x 0.8571 minutes = 25.7143 minutes, or 25 minutes, 42.85 seconds.\n\n"}
