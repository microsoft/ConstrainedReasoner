Looks amazing, food was perfect and great prices! Service was five star and the pricing was 2 star but tasted 5 star!!!!! I'll definitely be back :))"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2015-02-21 03:27:48", "review_text": "CBG is out of business.  It is now Cielo.  There is a full bar, and the menu is a mix of flatbreads, burgers, tex-mex, assorted appetizers.  There is inside and outside seating.  Bar has 8 spaces so get there early.  I did not have a cocktail so I cannot comment on the bartenders mixing skills. Except I did observe the pop rocks martini...hmmm childhood memories ;)\nI had the steak flatbread with onions and cheese.  Crust was paper thin and the steak was good but I was disappointed by a lack of seasoning.  The steak flatbread was overpriced for what you get.  The trip tip plate (tri tip, beans, rice and tortillas ) for 8 dollars looked like a better deal."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2015-02-20 22:15:34", "review_text": "Today's agenda:  1. Head to Carpinteria  2. Try out the new Cielo's restaurant  3. Get food poisoning\n\nTrust me this was NOT the intention.\n\nMy wife and I were so excited when Cielo's finally opened it's doors to the public after weeks of renovations after the take over of Cabo's.  Cabos' was one of our favorite go to spots for lunch and were hoping that Cielo's captured us as a regular the way it's predecessor did.\n\nWhen we arrived we did notice the positives. The interior was definitely upgraded as the booths give it a more restaurant ambiance.  The bathrooms were nicely done and very clean.\n\nWe sat in the front patio overlooking Carpinteria Blvd and took our first look at the new menus.  First thing we notice were the prices were about 25% higher than Cabos which is cool if the food warranted that price.  It's the standard beach diner fare with a bit of a higher end take on it.  Sliders, burgers, chicken plates, salads, apps, etc.   Were were disappointed at the price of the drinks (house margs were $10) and NO pitchers of margs anymore!  That sucked as that was one of the highlights of Cabos.   \n\nFirst time there we ordered the sliders.  Not bad but not great.  Heavy jalapeno overrode the beefy flavor of the meat.  They had a nice dessert menu and we ordered the carrot cake.  Not bad but the server had no idea where it was sourced from.  \n\nThe 2nd time we came we ordered the 1/4 chicken plate as that was our favorite dish at Cabo's.  Nightmare thru and thru.  Our plates arrived and we just looked at each other as the rice was in clumps.  Literally.  The rice and beans were cold to the touch and when we cut into the chicken it was RAW.   Dark pink RAW.  We called over the server and she apologized and took it back.  The same plates were returned with the same pieces of chicken grilled to a near burnt crisp (chefs revenge I'm guessing) and the rice and beans were still cold.  We called over the server to let her know and one of the owners came over to apologize.   We told her that we REALLY want to like this place as we LOVED Cabo's but the standards of the restaurant need to start with the standards in the kitchen and there is just NO care for the food here.  Even the cold beans had no flavor.  I texted my brother that we were here and his reply was \"nice patio...terrible food\".  \n\nAnyway unfortunately unless there are some major changes in the kitchen I'm never coming back to Cielo's.   Post script the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was the server was VERY nice and very helpful"}]}
