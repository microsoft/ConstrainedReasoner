{"question": "how well do patterned rollers work", "passages": "passage 1:In fact, homemade texture or decorative paint rollers can work better than the commercial variety because many faux finishes rely on applying a random pattern of texture to your walls, and commercial texture rollers apply paint with a set pattern.\n\npassage 2:I have been using the Dermaroller for a couple of months now and I think it does make a difference in my skin. I have been using the 1mm and it seems like it works better on my face than my neck and chest. When I tried the 1mm on those areas, they got super red, so I stopped. It seems like it is stimulating my skin and it looks younger and I have noticed that it has more of a healthy glow as well. We have so many before and after pictures on our site, so I can see that it does work as well. I have found that they do work best with the serums or moisturizers used right after. We do have a great kit that is perfect for anti-aging.\n\npassage 3:Basic Texture Roller. Place a roller pad with 1-inch or thicker nap (padding) on a roller frame. An old pad that has been used and not thoroughly cleaned (so some of the tufts clump together) works best for this. Stretch and twist rubber bands around the pad at a variety of angles, creating clumps and random patterns with tufts and lines. Apply paint to your walls with this roller as you would with any roller, but slightly adjust the rubber bands periodically as you work to renew the texture.\n\n"}
