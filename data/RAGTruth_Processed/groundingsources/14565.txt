We were coming from LA  and stopped by there to grab something to eat. We got pizza, burger, and gyros. My daughter liked the burger. I liked all the food. Our pizza was  burnt at the bottom but they gladly renewed. Great customer service"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-04 23:13:41", "review_text": "My friend and I stopped in here to grab an outdoor dinner on a beautiful evening and we had a great experience! The patio has plenty of seating, service at the counter and efficient and our cashier gave great recommendations since we had never eaten here before. Loved the vibe, with the kind of surfy decor and a playlist that took me back to the Caribbean.\n\nLet me start with the stars of the meal...the flatbread burger. Why aren't these a thing everywhere because they should be?! I ordered the East Bay BBQ and holy cow was it amazing. Meat was cooked to perfection, the house spread was something special, and the flatbread it came on was so good I basically have no words. My friend got the West Coast and she had the same reaction I did. We stuffed ourselves because it was so tasty. We also had chicken wings (with an absolutely delicious honey garlic sauce) and seasoned fries, both of which perfectly complemented the flatbread burgers.\n\nI would order this whole meal again exactly the same way it was so good. Only wish we had one where I live (hint hint guys, open some more locations further down in SoCal). Already planning to take my boyfriend here next time we take a little day trip up to SB."}]}
