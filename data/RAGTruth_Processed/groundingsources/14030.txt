I first observed how polite and respectful the employees were to the outdoor guest & the curbside/socially distant pickups, which stood out to me. I, then was cordially greeted by Wyatt. He embraced me and made sure all my questions were answered. I loved how patient Wyatt. I got the PICK 2 and my order was perfect. I am so grateful Wyatt made my experience exceptional.

Our food came cold, it was wrong, and there was missing things. Honestly this place is not it.

We are experts at getting your order wrong, running out of the only thing we have going for us (bread bowls), and giving you a bad attitude as you try and sort it out. Worry not -- our food will come icy cold no matter if it's Mac and cheese or soup! \n\nLooking for work? Our poor management is eagerly anticipating giving you poor training, and little help as you enter this low level job. We will show you how to treat customers poorly and give them less attention than a mean high school girl to a nerd in computer science class. Come serve our community with low efforts, and even less cares.\n\nSincerely, \nPanera bread"}]}
