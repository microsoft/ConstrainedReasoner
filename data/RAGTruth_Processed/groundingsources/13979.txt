Preparations Underway for November's Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix 2023
The Las Vegas Grand Prix marks the return of a Formula One Grand Prix event in forty years. The LVGP will take place on a newly created temporary street circuit. The track features a two-kilometer run down the Las Vegas Strip.
The F1 racetrack is 3.8 miles long and features 17 corners, 3 straights, and 3 DRS zones. The term “Formula” derives from the rules drivers must follow. In 2023, F1 will have 23 races for the first time, including the inaugural Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix, back after a 40-year absence.
Drivers in the Las Vegas Grand Prix will race at night. The city, an oasis of glittering lights, is to deliver a visual spectacle. The race is scheduled for November 18, 2023.
The Circuit
The last F1 race in Las Vegas, fully incorporated into the famous Caesars Palace casino car park, dates back to 1981 and 1982.
In designing the circuit for this November’s Grand Prix, more than thirty track designs before the FIA could agree on a final layout. The approved design features a spectacular, high-speed 14-turn high-speed circuit.
Teams will use their Monza-Spa aerodynamic packages. Low downforce allows a car to increase speed as drivers pilot their cars around the counterclockwise 14 turns.
The night race will help drivers beat the searing heat while allowing the spectacular Las Vegas city lights as a backdrop.
This race is scheduled to be the 1100th round of the Formula One World Championship.
