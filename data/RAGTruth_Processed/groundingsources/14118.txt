Wash your hands!!!!! You are going to make people sick!!!!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-10-24 23:09:03", "review_text": "Wonderful service here!  Hal and Azi do a great job running this shop.

You cannot find delicious Persian food like this anywhere else in Santa Barbara.  Yes, it's normally a sandwich place (and the sandwiches are also good) but the Persian food is amazing. \nThis Sams To Go is now Sams2U, so Yelp needs to update."}]}
