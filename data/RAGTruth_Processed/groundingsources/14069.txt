Every week, their menu changes slightly to give the customers the best and freshest options. I'm obsessed with the Khao Soi and Fried Chicken Sandwich, they both have so much flavor. Also, there's lots of space to eat even though indoor dining isn't currently open. You must check this place out while in SB!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-09-20 17:31:55", "review_text": "You will see a few reviews on here that says the ambience is amazing and the food is mediocre. I partly agree. \n\nThe first time I ordered from them is when they had their pop-up with a limited menu and ordered the regular and chipotle fried chicken. I thought the fried chicken was OK. It was heavily breaded which I did not like but the flavor of the chipotle was really good so I was torn. I was still determined to give it a second try because I love Asian fusion cuisine!\n\nSecond time I ordered the famous crunchy blue crab, shrimp salad and I thought it was SO refreshing and flavorful! It's around $15 so not bad for a large salad. Mine only had about 3 pieces of shrimp and plenty of blue crab to finish the salad. I do recommend the dish but I believe the other items are hit or miss. \n\nFor my people who are COVID conscious, they clean tables and have a sign to let you know it's been sanitized ."}]}
