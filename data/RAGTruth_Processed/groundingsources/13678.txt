I was there myself, picking up a meatball sub soon after they'd opened for business. If it's any testament to their popularity, I saw the lunch queue 30 people deep the Thursday before they closed, and the shop had about 50 people in it within 5 minutes of opening on their last Saturday.  My meatball sub was delicious.\nThis store was open for business for 36 years, my mother recalls this was the only place she could buy phyllo pastry way back when. For me, I liked the shop because it was the first in Santa Barbara to carry halloumi cheese. \nQuelle bummer to lose the Italian and Greek deli! But life goes on."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2007-01-31 20:11:04", "review_text": "The pastrami sandwich is well, the best I've ever had.  It's all warmly scrumptious and peppery and toasty and goo-ily provoloney and has pickles and pepperoncinis and is totally EPIC in its proportions (must be the Greek side of things). Mmmm....Even Carnegie Deli doesn't do it as well as these guys-different part of the country, but still... \n\nKiller Greek Salad (dolmas anyone?), various marinated olive selection in their case, and major bonus points for deviled egg option as well. The meatball sando hits the spot. But it's the GYRO that makes my tastebuds gyrate (I've never tried the cluck, but the lamb/beef dynamic option is fantastic). This is just about the best lunch in town, and you're home free with a big ol' Pellegrino and chips for less than 10 bucks. One of my favorite spots for sure. A fun stop on Farmer's Market Tuesday evenings!"}]}
