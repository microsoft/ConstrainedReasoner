I believe she is successful because she cares about her community locally and further afield. She brongs her heart not only to her work, but to all her relationships. When you meet her, you will see that she sees you as a human being with unique and important wants and needs. Her great comment to serve is un-matched! Go for it!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-01-27 18:42:30", "review_text": "If you find yourself single like I am and you're committed to finding someone special, I hope this review will be valuable. I want to recommend the perfect person to help you. Her name is Lisa Amador. She is an experienced matchmaker with all the skills and contacts to change your status from lonely to lively. I have tried online dating services. If you are particular about whom you wish to spend time with and if your time is valuable to you, just forget about them. Here's why: Lisa will only take you as a client after at least one consultation to get to know you, your personality and priorities. She will charge you a very fair amount for that meeting. She will then check your background (with your permission), create a confidential profile to share with candidates, then set up in-person dates. Lisa's integrity and professionalism is unquestioned. Her dedication to and enthusiasm for seeking out a match for you is inspirational. Importantly, the candidates she recommends will be vetted as well. That is the critical difference. You will meet people already matched with you in many ways. You can be confident they are not \"players,\" gold-diggers or users. They are genuine people like you looking for companionship and commitment. That is such a refreshing head start in this challenging process. If you are serious about your search, you need Lisa to have your back. I can no longer imagine doing this without her assistance. If you wonder why you would pay good money for a matchmaker, I did, too. I quickly realized that working with Lisa means you are investing in yourself, believing in yourself and knowing you are worth it. I love it that the other person is making that same investment. What's more important than your joy and happiness? If you are ready; if you want to stop dreaming and start meeting great potential lifemates, start with a consultation with Lisa. I'm very happy I did and I recommend her without reservation."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-02-20 15:31:07", "review_text": "Lisa's energy is contagious and it is obvious she is very good at her job. I really appreciated her sincerity and how enjoyable she made the process. Lisa is committed to her clients and has been a pleasure to get to know."}]}
