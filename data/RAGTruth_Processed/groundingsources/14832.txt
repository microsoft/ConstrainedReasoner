That's if you can flag down one of the many, busy, unhappy waitresses that run around like chickens with their heads cut off in front of a packed crowd on Sundays. That said, the food is good, not great, but I do enjoy the Turkey Guadalajara sandwich. \nWith DirectTV Sunday Ticket, DBC offers many TVs at the bar, on the patio and in the lounges that fill up quick so get there early to find a seat and a parking spot in their very small lot. The scene is young but I've only been there to watch a game at lunch and not seen who shows up for dinner. It won't be me but I'll be back for an IPA and some football."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2009-09-28 04:09:44", "review_text": "the good: fun atmosphere to watch sports, decent beer and pretty tasty pizza.\n\nthe bad: their 'brunch' menu for sunday football (10 bucks for crappy eggs), the occasional rude waitress (she yelled at the entire bar area to 'CHILL OUT') and understaffing which eventually leads to pretty slow service.  \n\nit's not bad to grab a beer on occasion here, but not my favorite place to go out in santa barbara."}]}
