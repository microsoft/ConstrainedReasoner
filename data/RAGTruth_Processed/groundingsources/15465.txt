{"question": "process of clotting blood", "passages": "passage 1:The body stops this blood loss through a complex clotting process called hemostasis. During hemostasis, the injured blood vessel constricts to reduce blood flow, platelets adhere to the injury site and clump (aggregate) together to form a loose platelet plug, and the coagulation cascade is initiated.\n\npassage 2:When a blood vessel is injured, the coagulation cascade is initiated and each coagulation factor is activated in a specific order to lead to the formation of the blood clot. Coagulation factors are identified with Roman numerals (e.g. factor I or FI). Watch Dr. Roshni Kulkarni\u2019s interactive animation.\n\npassage 3:When blood vessels are cut or damaged, the loss of blood from the system must be stopped before shock and possible death occur. This is accomplished by solidification of the blood, a process called coagulation or clotting.\n\n"}
