Their menu changes somewhat to include what's in season. There is a line where you pick from what's in the deli case. They do have some hot items that they will heat for you to eat there or you can take them home cold and reheat there. Some faves - kabocha squash soup with seeded honey , the chicken cutlet, the take home chicken pot pie when they have it and the absolutely TO DIE FOR chocolate chip cookie dough you take and bake. We ask for it with no salt on top , or you can scrape it off if you aren't a salt on cookie fan. I still want to try their sandwiches and other sweet items. Yes , they are rather pricey - the chicken pot pie  for  example is $19 but it feeds 2 with a salad and the quality ingredients make it worth it.  Now if they would only be open on Sundays too......"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-18 02:07:16", "review_text": "Had ham and butter on a baguette and a bag of chips. The bread was tough and chewy but the ham was tasty. The chips tasted homemade with a pinch of bbq. Nice and crispy and generous portion but $16 was way more than this lunch was worth. Will try a couple other items before making a final decision!"}]}
