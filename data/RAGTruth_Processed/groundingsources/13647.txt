Food was incredible and was so cozy. Not busy at all when I went so I hope they get enough business\n\nI got the Penne Alla Boscaiola. It was mushroom, bacon and cream sauce. Absolutely to die for \n The bread was also so incredible. I ate so much haha but you could definitely tell the bread was fresh!' \n\nMust come!\nHighly recommend"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-04-18 13:38:41", "review_text": "Amazing experience at this adorable, cozy and delicious restaurant just up the road from the main strip in Montecito! Pane e Vino is tucked away in the corner of a cute little shopping center on E Valley Road, just a quick minute off the 101 Fwy. It has outdoor, patio and inside dining, beautiful setting. We went for lunch on a Saturday and it was quiet and peaceful, honestly far better than waiting for one of the crowded, expensive spots on the main drag. Food was off the charts good! Italian owned and operated for 32 years, they use locally sourced fresh produce and high quality ingredients. The olive oil was rich and delicious, it was quality. The chef custom made chicken piccatta off menu for my dad and it was the best I've ever tasted. I had the spinach salad and added grilled shrimp. Their pancetta and grilled shrimp were amazingly good.. this was the BEST salad I have ever had. Service was amazing.. loved our serving staff. This is a local's favorite that we stumbled upon and it was an absolute gem! Bravo Pane e Vino for providing a first class experience across the board! Worth every penny!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-03-22 06:25:26", "review_text": "Another reviewer said they were \"sized up\" upon arrival. My sentiments exactly.  I guess if you don't arrive in a Range Rover, you aren't worth the trouble.  Nauseating..... really!  We had high hopes for this place on our anniversary weekend. We arrived and were sat by a friendly bus boy, then we sat for another 15 minutes without acknowledgement from any server.  No water/bread.... nada!  I was a server for 12 years so I get being busy, but there was plenty of help on staff and only a few tables.  We finally got the attention of an apathetic, rather aloof server, while what seemed to be the manager/owner continued to schmooze the bougie table (ya know the kind that looks like they've walked out of a J.Crew commercial) right next to us without so much as a glance our way.  I find this type of behavior from an owner unacceptable.  So for just north of a $100 you'll get unfriendly staff, subpar dry bread, underwhelming salad, & teeny portions of mediocre food.   After asking for our check, which the owner took, then we again sat waiting, as he schmoozed the same table, holding our check and not running our card. Still, we tipped 15% & did not complain as I'm sure it wouldn't have been received.  I certainly won't ever be back.  We were going to order dessert and coffee, but went down to road to give our money to Ca' Dario, where they were happy to see us, the dessert was exquisite and the service wasn't pretentious crap!  Left $50 tip on a $50 tab there, too.  Save yourself the trouble and go there, or McDonald's.... either way, you'll have a better experience."}]}
