Before entering the restaurant, I noticed signage on the front door regarding mask wearing. Upon entering the restaurant, I was warmly greeted by a restaurant employee. Despite a long line, we were soon able to place our order. The restaurant employee apologized for the long wait and quickly took our order. I was a bit bummed that I was unable to scan my Peet's app to get app rewards but was happy at how quickly our food was ready. I did appreciate that vegan food items are clearly labeled at the restaurant and on the Peet's app. \n\nThe everything plant based bagel sandwich contained vegan sausage, vegan egg, and vegan cheese on an bagel and was delicious. The iced lemon poppyseed scone was sweet but not overly sweet. I would love to see more hot plant based sandwiches on their menu but love that this option is currently available for vegans, vegetarians, and the veg-curious. Although I'm saddened that there not more Peet's location where I live, I will definitely plan to pay them a visit the next time I'm in a city that has a Peet's location."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-26 21:36:28", "review_text": "This review is specifically for Marilyn (I think is her name. She has long brown hair and is in her early 20s). I was having issues with the app and connectivity and wanted to redeem some points and a coupon I had. Marilyn tried to help me but I had no reception, so she helped me out with redemption on my drink.\nThe manager (I think) with glasses overheard me talking about it to my friend and asked me what had happened, then went over and spoke to Marilyn about it like she shouldn't have done that.\nWhat's so sad is that Marilyn did a great job, helped me out and I would have definitely stopped by this Peets when I pass through SB again. But the manager (or lead, whoever she was) listening in to my conversation and then talking to Marilyn about the situation made me feel what she did was wrong, when she was trying to make it right.\n\nPlease give Marilyn a shout out and a raise. She's great!"}]}
