From the wine to the meal and topping off with dessert, our dining experience has been nothing short of wonderful and memorable. There was a wedding party of about 30+ and we all got seated in our private space just fine. Server staff were friendly and accommodating. \n\nFor starters, I had the Caesar salad and hubby had the clam chowder... Followed by the miso-glazed cod with scallions, baby bok choy and mashed potatoes. The cod with a little bit of broth was just melt-in-your-mouth delicious goodness! My taste buds were dancing around... I honestly enjoyed my dish. Hubby had the double glazed double pork, also with bok choy and rice pilaf, which he seemed to enjoyed due to its taste and tender cut. Dessert followed with some Neapolitan gelato and chocolate cake with raspberry gelato. Molto bene!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2016-01-02 04:30:49", "review_text": "For all they hyped reviews, I can't understand why. It's no surprise that when I finally get around to writing this review, I see this business has since closed their doors since I tried this place back in April 2015.\n\nService was okay, not great. The restaurant itself was fairly large with modern decor and a dim interior. Food was average, we ordered the artichoke appetizer $7, mussels $13, fish and chips $12, and a grey goose cocktail and a glass of Justin cab, $10 and $14 respectively.\n\nThe $60 spent was mediocre at best and won't be missing Arch Rock now that it's permanently closed.\n\n*yawn*"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-12-05 06:50:52", "review_text": "Great place.
