Amazing comfort food. And it's easy on your heart and your body because it is plant-based. All vegan options.\n2. Feel good about what you're doing for yourself, the community and the globe. Did you know Modern Times kitchens are cooperatively owned?!\n3. Great beer from craft beer to root beer\n4. Really cool art installation and lots of good outside seating\nThis is a hidden gem and worth a find. You have to walk down an alley There's a restaurant in front that you can often enter through as well. However that was going through some remodeling\n\nThere's lots of parking lots nearby. Friendly service and a great vibe  all around. \nOur favorite item is the taco melt. I can't remember what it's called but I have a picture of it on my review"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-20 22:43:31", "review_text": "The Quick: The most incredible indulgent (guilt free) food and awesome beer.

The food is good as well. They've carved out a nice section of the street where they've been able to put together a lively patio. \n\nA must stop when you're taking a day in Santa Barbara  - you won't regret it as a quick place to refresh and recharge."}]}
