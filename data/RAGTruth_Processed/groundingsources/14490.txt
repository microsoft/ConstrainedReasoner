{"question": "how do you change guitar chords into piano chords", "passages": "passage 1:It's extremely simple. If you're using sheet music with the chords written on already, then there is no change at all! If you're not, then what you need to do is find the bass note of the chord. So, for a chord consisting of C, E, and G, the Bass note is C and that's the chord you need to play on the guitar :).ometimes, notes need to be subtracted from chords on a guitar because of string organization. For example, a 9th chord has 5 notes, but the guitar can only play four different notes at a time. The piano has all five. So, a piano Gmaj9 would look like this: G B D F A while a guitar Gmaj9 would look like this: G B F A.\n\npassage 2:I'm a starting keyboardist and I want to learn to chord better. I get chords from guitar sites since there are no piano chords of songs that I know of except http://classpiano.com/ Here's what I know-Simple chords (Majors and minors) - chord inversions Here's what I don't know-Reading...ere's what I don't know. - Reading guitar tabs and turning them into piano-playable chords. - Converting guitar chords with capo into piano-playable chords. ex (http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/s/st...\n\npassage 3:Just because a song is written in TABS doesn\u2019t mean that piano players can\u2019t read it also. So, here\u2019s how to translate guitar tabs so you can play piano chords! First, let\u2019s establish a basic understanding of the guitar.The notes of the open strings from thickest to thinnest are E, A, D, G, B, and E. Also, each fret on guitar is a half step.o find the first note, we look at which string it\u2019s played on. The number 7 is on the third line from the bottom, which indicates the D string. Since the fret number is 7, we\u2019re going to count up 7 half steps from the open D string. Feel free to use your piano to help you do this.\n\n"}
