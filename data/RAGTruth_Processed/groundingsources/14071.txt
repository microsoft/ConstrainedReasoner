In a town where seafood, sandwiches, and Mexican food are the bread and butter of restaurant life, they shone. During my freshman year of college, I'd come here like clockwork to celebrate the end of another quarter with their delicious chef's special seafood cioppino and 10% student discount. Over the past two years, though, things have changed.\n\nWith the introduction of poke bowls on the menu ($12 on the laminated menus, $12.99 on the chalkboards hanging over their open kitchen), it appears that there are some new things to try at I'a since I last saw them in early 2016. I opted for a go at their shoyu salmon poke, though not entirely by my choice. Recent salmon scares (did you know fish get lice too?) made me weary of the fish, but at 5:30 p.m. on a Sunday, they were out of all but one scoop of their ahi tuna. I guess it wouldn't be as fresh as it was in the morning when prepared. \n\nConsidering how popular of an option it was compared to the salmon bathing in spicy mayo, though, I wonder if it'd be a better restaurant practice to make more of the fish that sells. They seemed ill-prepared for any dinner rush due to the near-empty serving platters of ahi tuna and shoyru salmon, as did the guy who looked annoyed taking our orders. At the time, they also appeared to be out of octopus and hamachi.\n\nI got a generous 3-4 scoops of salmon, which tasted slightly too fishy. My fish was swimming in way too much seaweed salad, carrots, and cucumbers, and would have been better with more bean sprouts and rice. I asked for the shoyu sauce on the side and certainly didn't regret it, since I drizzled on too much at the end and felt like I was drinking soup. Flavor-wise, it tasted like a poke salad, not a poke bowl, emphasis on the salad.\n\nWhile I suppose I'm paying $12.99 for the quality, it genuinely didn't feel outstanding, and it's not like I'm paying for the ambiance either. Guess the money's going toward the service provided by the one guy who looked both bored, tired, and like he needed a beer to get through the day, and the cook running around the kitchen trying to clean and get everything else together. I'm not the fan of I'a the way I used to be, although I suppose I'll have to revisit for the fish tacos and oysters some day."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-02-16 01:36:22", "review_text": "I love I'a! I am so happy that they are in the Santa Barbara Public Market. This is my go to spot for poke when I am in Downtown Santa Barbara. They have so many varieties to choose from and it is incredibly fresh. Try the Hamachi, Octopus, Spicy Salmon, Ahi Tuna...you know what, just try it all! It's wonderful. If you're taking it home, I recommend buying the poke a la carte versus in the poke bowl. It just seems you get more bang for your buck in my humble opinion. Then pair it will sauteed veggies and brown rice or cauliflower rice when you get home for a high protein, nutrition-rich meal."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-01-03 07:16:53", "review_text": "Excelente servicio y ambiente.
