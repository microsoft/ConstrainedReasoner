And the burrito was the size of a loaf of bread. Pricing is cheap and any time that trailer is open, I'm going. Good salsa, friendly service. A great local food truck and I'm glad I found it. Go and have a good meal for yourself.

We tried a sampler platter to get a little of everything. Food was delicious. Ribs had a good flavor, the pulled pork was sweet and smoky and the chicken leg was nicely sauced. The sides were very generous sized. The coleslaw had a nice flavor and slight crunch and wasn't too wet or too sweet. The pinto (?) beans were awesome, esp with a splash of habanero sauce on them. And the mac and cheese had been grilled which did dry it out a hair but imparted a great taste that was worth the trade off. All in all it was delicious and a great value at $25."}]}
