The server greeted me and asked if I wanted to select the buffet as an option or a la carte. A la carte was my choice and I ordered something familiar \"sweet an sour chicken\" which wouldn't disappoint me. \n\nThe arrival time of my order was approx. 12 minutes. I was served with a pot of rice and a plenty of sweet and sour chicken that I could not finish the dish even though I tried my hardest lol.\n\nWhat I most appreciated about the staff was their composure and time they had given me to enjoy my meal without the extra \"are you finished\" and the constant hovering near my dining table. I like their relaxed demeanor."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-08-09 19:22:14", "review_text": "Stopped by for a hunting trip. This restaurant hosting a buffet and a regular order restaurant. When first entered , we see greeted by a kitchen worker. Then the owner came out and served us. We ordered about 7 plates. No pictures. \n\n1. Taste: all the food we ordered were just standard Chinese good and does not required any sophisticated skill. All the food we ordered tastes way way way lower than all other restaurants. Trufully my 2 year old son cooks much much better than this. 0 star\n2. Service:after the initial encounter with the kitchen worker then the service started receiving some service. 2star\n3. Hygiene: this is considered pretty clean and neat restaurant. 4 star\n4. Quality: kind of bad. The chicken we ordered were too old and dried. The soup, we're just MSG water and some fish balls in it. The water were tape water.  The tomato fried eggs( eggs over cooked tomato too raw). 1 star"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-08-03 21:54:40", "review_text": "BUFFET ONLY REVIEW \nFood was dry and flavorless , barely any options . Tasted worse than most take out Chinese places. You could taste how old the food was it looked like it was sitting out for about three to four hours. No ice cream or any decent deserts either besides jello. DO NOT EAT AT THE BUFFET."}]}
