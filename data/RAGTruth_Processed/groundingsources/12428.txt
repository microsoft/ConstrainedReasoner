{"question": "what is different about the hobbit and lord of the rings", "passages": "passage 1:Source: Total Film via io9. Peter Jackson on how The Hobbit differs from The Lord of the Rings: JACKSON: The Hobbit is very much a children's book and The Lord of the Rings is something else; it's not really aimed at children at all. I realized the characters of the dwarves are the difference. Their energy and disdain of anything politically correct brings a new kind of spirit to it.\n\npassage 2:There's just so much depth within the Lord of the Rings, I see something new every time I watch it. Each character is dynamic, wheras in the Hobbit, every dwarf seems to carry the same silly, unintelligent, flat character as another. The Lord of the Rings gave me something different to root for in every character.\n\npassage 3:The Hobbit is the prelude to the popular Lord of the Rings series, and is a single novel, while The Lord of the Rings is a lengthy trilogy. The protagonist in The Hobbit is Bilbo Baggins, while The Lord of the Rings focuses mostly on the adventures of Frodo Baggins, Bilbo\u2019s nephew. The plot in The Hobbit revolves around Bilbo Baggins\u2019 journey to the Lonely Mountain with the dwarves, and their battle with Smaug the dragon.\n\n"}
