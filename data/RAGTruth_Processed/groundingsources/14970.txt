The food is fresh and it's easy for me to get take out. The staff is generally very friendly and I appreciate the food choices. Today, I ordered a half an old town salad to go with Saut\u00e9ed tofu. Everything was there, but as I began eating it, a rather large winged bug crawled out of the lettuce. It concerns me that the lettuce and vegetables are not being washed properly, particularly in a time when people are so worried about illness.  It seems just recently that I have noticed this sort of thing happening.  I think cleanliness is of the utmost concern at this time. I hope the issue is resolved. Thank you."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 03:40:47", "review_text": "fast, tasty, reasonably priced... seriously can't get any better! This food hits the spot! the portions are great, definitely get what you pay for, AND the food is so so tasty and good for ya! we couldn't have asked for more! we recommend the mexican inspired food! burritos, enchiladas, and tacos are all so fresh and good! but also can't go wrong with any of the vegetarian stir fry or sand which options!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-26 17:51:39", "review_text": "Probably one of my faves in all of Santa Barbara. While there isn't table service (you order at the counter), the finished product of food entree is usually a work of art.\n\nI ordered a shredded burrito & beer one afternoon upon leaving SB, and needed something to stay on my bones for a while when driving eastbound into Pasadena. Natural Cafe served up an entree that was a pleasant surprise, with shredded beef that seemed lightly seasoned. Even the salad was pretty good. No complaints about the beer.\n\nIt took a little time for the burrito to arrive, which was ok. I had eaten one of the cookies sold at the counter as a small appetizer. While an employee indicated that there was Wi-Fi, this really isn't set up for it. I had taken a tablet out to reference something, yet had to use my network. No big deal.\n\nI love returning to this venue, and highly recommend it for a good lunch."}]}
