We left NO CRUMBS. The best addition was the grilled insides of the bowl and top part of the bowl. Highly recommend, can't wait to visit next time we are in the area."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-30 20:08:17", "review_text": "Ordered this from Postmates and made the perfect lazy Sunday for me and my lady. Best bread bowl I've legit had! For delivery, they even delivered it in under 30 minutes too. I love how they even grill and spread garlic on the piece of bread they cut out. I used to think Boudin Bakery in San Francisco had the best bread bowls, but these guys are the new kings \n\nI had the build your own bowl and I'm excited to comeback and try to Buffalo chicken bowl!\n\nAlso, I ordered mashed potatoes in my bowl, and was impressed that Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes mixed well together!"}]}
