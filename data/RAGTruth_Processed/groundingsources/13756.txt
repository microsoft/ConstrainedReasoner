Stayed for most of happy hour a couple days. killer margaritas. And huge selection of tequilas too. \n\nThe reason I gave it a great review is they had an appetizer I have never been able to find anywhere else. It was called \"Ball of Fire\" \"For people that like really hot or just plain lunatics\" It was a Habanero Popper. Like a jalapeno popper but WAYYYYY hotter. It was fun trying to cool off with more beer or margaritas. Thank God we had a ride back home. Anyhow great memory & we really enjoyed the chips and salsa & the happy hours."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2009-10-05 21:23:14", "review_text": "It was all wrong from the moment I asked if we could sit at the bar to have an appetizer and drinks, and the girl that was seating us said, \"yes,\" but we must order an appetizer.  Then she proceeded to take us out to the patio which confused me because I asked for the bar, but I dismissed that.  She sat us at a table, and we ordered our appetizer and drinks from the server.  He comes back with our drinks and explains that they may ask us to move inside because the patio is reserved for customers ordering dinners rather than just appetizers and drinks.  The patio was not full at all, and we told him we were told that we could order an appetizer alone, but still he said we may have to move later as that is the rule.  No apologies at all.  Ugh - I wanted to leave right after his comment...but I figured I should have my beer first.   First, we never asked to be seated outside; second, if that is a rule at the restaurant, why did they seat us outside when we specifically asked for the bar and told the seater that we were only ordering appetizer and drinks?  \n\nOh, the appetizer was not so great, but we didn't order anything fancy.  It's possible their other food is really good though.  The server spilled my beer on my sunglasses :( .  We quickly had our drinks and appetizer, paid, then got out of there."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2009-09-23 21:14:27", "review_text": "Great outdoor patio area.  Loved the ambiance.  The chips and salsa are good, food was okay.  Nothing special."}]}
