That being said, I've been a couple times with different omnivorous friends who have ranging impressions of the place. While some of my friends seem to like it, many seemed underwhelmed by the wings, their staple item. I've gotten the artichoke hearts a couple times, which are decent, but offensively overpriced. This seems to be the moral of On the Side's story.\n\nPossibly the place's saving grace is their great selection of brews. Unfortunately, their selection comes with a price. They have a bunch of flat screens, so I'd say this is a good place to grab a drink and watch a game, but I wouldn't recommend it much further than that."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2010-07-15 17:47:10", "review_text": "They changed the way you order which is TOTAL CRAP!!! Instead of resteraunt style ordering everyone has to order up at the counter now which is just ridiculous. They need to change this back again ASAP!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2010-06-24 00:21:25", "review_text": "Good food. The portions looked kinda small at first, but was full by the time I finished everything. My favorite item is the buffalo wings, they might be some of the best in santa barbara. The service was like whatevers, the waitress was kind of a noob and forgot about taking back the bill so i had to go up to the counter and pay there."}]}
