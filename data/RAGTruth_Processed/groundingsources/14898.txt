I'm out of town for the weekend so I will miss their official closing day, Sunday. And I'm sure that will be a madhouse. So today was how, if it must go, I wanted to send it off. With a small lunch with friends, and a beer on the side. \n\nMy parents took me here when I was a baby in a basket, and they said they put me up on the tabletop to watch them eat. That's how long I've been coming to Deano's. \n\nIt's what I think a pizza parlor should be: sports on the big screen (and I don't care for sports), beer on tap, long tables, red velvet bordello wallpaper, loads of neon, and video/pinball games.\n\nLong tables means bumping in to people you don't know and making friends. There isn't a rush to get you out of the place. There's always more time to get more quarters for the machine.\n\nAnd so to the pizza. The crust is super crispy crunchy, which I hear is from the amount of folding, the soda cracker flour (rumor), and the parchment paper it sits on in the oven. This is how I like my pizza. Your own favorite style may vary. When I was living abroad I thought about Deano's a lot. And yes, I've had NY pizza, and I had a great slice on the Lower East Side. But my heart belongs here. \n\nSo it sucks that the economy, greedy landlords, and maybe even the competition (a Giovanni's across the street) have caused this place to shut down. The outpouring of love over the past two weeks, however, gives me some hope. (I also went last Sunday and I had to wait 90 minutes to get my pizza...gladly) Maybe Deano's will open up somewhere nearby.\n\nFor now I've got about 8 slices in my freezer...waiting. When I have that final slice, then I know that Deano's will really be gone...sniff! :-("}]}
