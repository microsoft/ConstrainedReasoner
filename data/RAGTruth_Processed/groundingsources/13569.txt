'Big Brother 25' Spoilers: Week 12 POV Competition Results, HOH Target's Fate Sealed?
Big Brother 25 (BB25) spoilers tease that a new Power of Veto winner has been crowned and has the opportunity to save one of the nominees from eviction. Big Brother Network reports that Jag Bains won the POV competition, giving him his fifth straight win (three POV wins and two HOH).
After Cory Wurtrnberger's 5-0 eviction vote on Thursday, Jag won the Head of Household (HOH) competition. He nominated Blue Kim and America Lopez for eviction. Jag told Matt Klotz that his target is Blue, adding he has no plans to save either nominee to ensure Blue's eviction.
Everyone played in the POV competition but Cirie. Jag won the competition, giving him the power to save one of the nominees.
Blue continues to try to get votes to stay in the house another week. Bowie Jane, and Matt want Blue to leave this week. With only four votes being cast, Jag needs one more vote to lock down Blue's eviction.
It seems unlikely that Cirie Fields would vote Blue out. Felica Cannon would likely vote to evict Blue to survive another week.
Jag may be in a good position right now on Big Brother, but a double eviction is coming. He cannot compete in the next HOH competition, which means Matt must win the HOH competition to keep Jag safe.
Big Brother 25 spoilers say that Blue's fate is likely sealed, but Matt must win the next HOH competition, or Jag will follow her during Thursday's live double eviction.
