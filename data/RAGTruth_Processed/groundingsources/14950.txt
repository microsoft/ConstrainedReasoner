I can still go to my grandmothers house on the lower west side to get authentic Mexican food any day of the week. After moving away from SB for years and sampling Mexican food all over the state- I am proud to say that Santa Barbara is home to pretty much the best Me I can food this side of the border. Luckily, every single spot has something to offer. Needless to say I have a very high expectations for Mexican food in my community. \n\nThat being said Super Cucas has always been there for me; whether it's for a shrimp taco plate after work or a post beach burrito.\n\nThe food at Super Cucas tastes authentic: there are, vegan, vegetarian, and traditional options to choose from. Currently, they are offering vegan dishes from Rascals vegan kitchen ( they are fire!) \n\nI do miss the salsa bar that was available prior to Covid- but other than that super Cucas  has never done me wrong and I like to see that after all these years the staff has largely the remained the same (so did the prices). \n\nI always leave a tip when I order to go because my food comes out delicious in in a timely manner.\n\nMy go to order- \nA grilled veggie with no cheese or sour cream.\nOr\nThe shrimp plate tortillas on the side, no pico de gallo! It with veggies rice, beans and seasoned shrimp .\n\n\nI recommend Super Cucas for there casual and authentic Mexican food."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-01 19:32:02", "review_text": "This is one if the best Mexican restaurants in town, their super burrito and tacos are amazing, consistently good every time. I had an issue with a door dash order where I was missing most of my food, I tried calling my dasher and he was rude, referred me to customer service and after half hour wait I gave up. So I called this super cucas and they did not disappoint, brought me my food within 15 minutes and gave me some chips for free too. The man who came from the restaurant to deliver the food was very polite and apologetic, food was amazing."}]}
