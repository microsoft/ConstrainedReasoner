We went out of our way to stop here on our way down from Santa Cruz to LA as we are always looking for new Vegan restaurants to try.  On Sunday the menu is limited to burgers and fries. It was all very tasty but just not what we were in the mood for.  Nice ambiance and classy bar.  Will have to make it during the week sometime."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-10-27 00:59:01", "review_text": "Incredible vegan sandwich, great desert! - beer was served in a small glass not a regular beer glass for $5"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-22 02:32:53", "review_text": "Holy smokes, the food here is really tasty! I'd happily eat anything on the menu, but the spectacular elotes would keep me coming back."}]}
