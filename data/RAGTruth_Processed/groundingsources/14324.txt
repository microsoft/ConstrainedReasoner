{"question": "how to explain quartiles", "passages": "passage 1:The first quartile is also known as 25th percentile, the second quartile as 50th percentile, and the third quartile as 75th percentile. The Interquartile range is from Q1 to Q3. It is the difference between lower quartile and upper quartile. First arrange the data in ascending order.\n\npassage 2:In statistics, quartiles are three points that divide the data set into four equal groups. Each group represents the one-fourth of the data set. First quartile (Q 1), also known as lower quartile, splits the lower 25% of data. It is the middle value of lower half. Second quartile (Q 2) which is more commonly known as median splits the data in half (50%). Median divides the data into a lower half and an upper half. Third quartile (Q 3), also known as upper quartile, splits lowest 75% (or highest 25%) of data.\n\npassage 3:The first quartile is also known as 25th percentile, the second quartile as 50th percentile, and the third quartile as 75th percentile. (A percentile is the value of a variable below which a certain percent of observations fall) The Interquartile range is from Q1 to Q3.\n\n"}
