I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but it was dry and flavorless (MC), and there were a bunch of bones and non-gelatinzed pieces of fat (SC). One of the few times I've ever had to throw out my dinner instead of just bearing it. I'm not sure what the dishes were called, since there are no name plates, but one looked like mandarin chicken (MC), and the other was referred to as \"spicy\" chicken (SC.\n\nTo whatever credit they may deserve, the chow mein/lo mein (not sure) was actually better than your average fast food counterpart. Take that as you will."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-02 04:34:48", "review_text": "Best restaurant in IV if ur looking for Chinese Food. Some dishes are on rotation. You know it's authentic when the chef mainly speaks Mandarin!

Portions are dank. Cha siu questionable, everything else is dank. Would revisit every other day if I were not a poor college kid."}]}
