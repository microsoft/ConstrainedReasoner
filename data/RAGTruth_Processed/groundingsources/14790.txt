A croissant and a coffee with run you for around $6.50 with tips. Sorry but the croissant was dry and really not tasty. I'm french so i believe i know how  a croissant should taste :) Kind of disappointed about it. The place is great though. The staff is pretty friendly but i will not go back. I'm pretty sure if they don't change the quality and the price they will be gone quickly!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2017-11-27 22:02:10", "review_text": "What I tasted from samples was awesome. I ordered an omelette with goat cheese spinach and turkey bacon along with avocado and creme fresh. We also ordered the gobbler and banh mi...\n\nAfter eating it the verdict is really great. Omelette was spot on. The Banh mi was great, could of used a little more flavor and filling. Bread was delicious. Cranberries on the gobbler were extremely tart and made my mouth dance after the savory turkey bacon in my omelette. Then all that was left to try was the tuna. Fresh and basic. Better late then never was the arrival of sourdough toast with butter. AWESOME. We enjoyed our lunch and time together."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-11-26 21:23:27", "review_text": "I love this place. I can always count on fresh, quality food.
