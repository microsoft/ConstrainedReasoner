The owners were from Brittany, France. When the mother worked there she ONLY spoke French, even if the customers couldn't. I still don't know how much English she could speak. They hosted our French conversation group for many years (we now meet Wednesdays at Arnoldi's; if you speak a little fran\u00e7ais come join us). Au revoir, PC!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-11-26 06:51:57", "review_text": "Delicious and unique french cafe.  Wonderful service.  Amazing coffee too.
