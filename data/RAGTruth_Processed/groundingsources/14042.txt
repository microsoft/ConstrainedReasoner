They have lovely patio out front the main eat in Santa Barbara, so it makes for great people watching. We offer a bottle of rose, light starters, and enjoyed the moment until the next stop. If you are in Santa Barbara it's worth stopping in as you make your way through town either walking or on a bike ride. We preferred the later."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-11 02:45:18", "review_text": "Ordered for delivery.

We passed it while visiting during dinner and it was packed so we figured it must be good. We decided to stop for brunch while it was pouring rain. There was a wait but luckily they took my number and texted me when it was ready, so I could wander around other shops and stuff and didn't have to wait out in the rain. The hostess was really nice as was our waitress, I totally forgot her name! The only complaint is that she brought our check before we were done; I really hate the feeling of being rushed out and we had to add a couple things after the bill came. She was super nice about it and brought us the drinks we ordered right away.\nLike I said, the food was absolutely amazing. It doesn't sound filling from the descriptions but it totally is and it is so so good. The \"side\" of fries portion was huge. It is definitely a splurge for brunch as the food is kind of fancy and the presentation is also really impressive. We only ate here for brunch but I would assume their dinner is just as great."}]}
