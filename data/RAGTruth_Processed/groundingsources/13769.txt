Read the menu for awhile and besides the wide variety of items (breakfast, specials, Mexican, American burgers, sandwiches, desserts) to peruse, you'll get a kick out of names particularly if you have a legal background. Our server, Roberto, was outstanding. The place is spotless. No loose debris or food lying around. At 1 point, Roberto bent over to pick up a paper the size of a pea off the floor. This is an old place but I looked around and this was the only thing marring the floor. My wife thought \"only an owner\" would bother but Roberto said no. No one had been sitting at that table next to us but he came over, gently picking up the condiments, as he wiped it thoroughly down again.  We sat there eating our food which came out fast. Minutes later, a customer came in and took her seat there. Some unspoken communication took place and within  minutes, her breakfast came out. Ah, the pleasure of being a regular.  Good service doesn't mean anything if the food isn't any good but they hit a home run. We ordered 4 items along with coffee. I forget what my wife ordered but I got an Ortega Special (a 4-egg omelet with onions/Ortega chili's that came with hash browns which was crispy and tasty but not oily), and a club sandwich with home fries and tuna sandwich with fruit to go. Fruit was fresh, sweet and came in big slices (watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe).  Total cost was $69 including tax. We'll be passing through SB for the night in 3 weeks and we will make a point of stopping in again. I guess there is no better review than to say \"I'm coming back\"."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 19:05:18", "review_text": "I love a good diner breakfast and this was probably the best I've had in Santa Barbara! Very mellow, Hot fresh food, kind, attentive service and the best thick cut bacon. What else do you need? The food felt fresh because of the lack of greasiness often found in diner-style food and indoor seating was available and cute."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-08-15 18:37:47", "review_text": "The place itself is very cute and has great service, however I would steer clear of the blueberry french toast.
