I did not sit inside where the pianos are at, but sat outside (outside seating/patio area is available right on the street post Covid). Really fun atmosphere, able to grab a drink and listen to live music, as well as people watch. Plenty of standing heaters available for when it's chilly outside. Only downfall was there is no food offered; so you can only stay so long."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-06 05:19:09", "review_text": "Met my future wife here.

Fun piano bar vibe with sing alongs. Bartenders are sociable and attentive. The cocktails were not to my liking.  They were good but could have had a little more love in them."}]}
