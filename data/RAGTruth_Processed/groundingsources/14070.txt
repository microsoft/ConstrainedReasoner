First off, they don't just make pizzas to go, they make amazing sandwiches! The Italian sub is by far my favorite. The rolls taste fresh and the meats are perfect! The combination of everything in the sandwich is just amazing! I'm not even a fan of sandwiches but this is my first choice of food there! \n\nOkay so the pizzas. I used to question why anyone would want to make their own pizza. Isn't the point to pay for someone to do the work for you? I moved beyond my high maintenance thinking after eating a pizza at a friend's house. It's NOT that difficult to throw it in the oven and the instructions are right on the packaging. The pizza came out of the oven smelling amazing and it was perfectly cooked! I took a bite and my goodness! Fresh baked pizza with little work put in! No cold pizza getting delivered to your house...just a yummy pizza perfectly cooked. And you can pick it up any time, put it in the fridge, and baked when you're ready for dinner! Genius! I appreciate the fresh ingredients and warm pizza. I can't pick a favorite pizza because they've all been amazing. Just go try one then try a second then a third...you won't regret it!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-03 17:57:44", "review_text": "Always can depend on Valentino's for delicious food!

This was our second time ordering a bulk order from this establishment and she got it done! We ordered 120 half sandwiches (100 turkey and 20 veggie) for new student orientation. She informed me that early bread deliveries recently have been tight bc of the pandemic, but the sandwiches were prepared and ready to go when I arrived! Shayre is such a sweet, hardworking individual and I highly recommend Valentino's for any event!"}]}
