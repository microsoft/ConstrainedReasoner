We don't live in the area but now make it a point to stop by and satisfy our Nikka craving whenever we're in Goleta.\n\nThe gyoza was a yummy appetizer but the spicy tuna was sooooo goood! I could eat 10 of those! The basic pork tonkatsu was just as delicious as I remember. Al dente noodles and broth cooked to perfection. The pork chashu is A1 quality. Every ingredient was meant to be on that plate from the tender pork chunks to the salad to the soft boiled egg.\n\nWe love Nikka. Period."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-07 01:34:51", "review_text": "Holly F@ck... mind blowing. Literally spent the last 20 minutes of my life having a mouth gasm.
