Local, who used to use this place for everything, and a spot to celebrate girlfriends birthdays. The food was not the issue. The staff is flat, unengaging and silent. You can feel their stuffy awkward energy. As someone who used to be a server myself, I always love being courteous to server staff/tipping well. But man, very hard to do here."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-10 20:40:01", "review_text": "Omg I'm a hard core pizza aficionado and this could be my new favorite pizza place in North America. Don't let it's location in the Montecito Country Mart fool you, please make a reservation asap. \n\nThe menu is very tight but that's fine. Everyone raves about the carbonara pizza but I hate eggs do we skipped it. We wanted a light lunch to save room for steak dinner so we opted for a bottle of Sancerre, baby gems salad and meat lovers pizza. They all hit perfectly!\n\nThe server was terrific. The ambiance felt like a garden getaway and parking was too easy. Please run to this lovely restaurant and grab a matchbox or two for the memories."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-06 05:51:02", "review_text": "Decided to check out Bettina during our recent trip to Santa Barbara and boy was it a great experience. The location is random (in the Montecito country mart shopping center) but the inside and the courtyard of the restaurant are charming. And we figured we came to a good spot when we noticed all the locals either dining there or picking up pies. Everything we ordered was delicious! We got the burrata to start, that had this amazing green pistachio/veggie paste on top - it also came with an excellent Focaccia. Broccolini, which was tangy, charred to perfection and just delish.  And two pizzas, the mushroom and pepperoni, which may have been the best I've had. Great little spot in SB, highly recommend."}]}
