{"question": "what are the various functions of proteins in the human body?", "passages": "passage 1:Other than water, proteins are the most abundant type of chemical in the human body. Proteins play many vital roles in the human body, including providing structure and strength to cells and tissues, controlling biochemical reactions and aiding the immune system. Metabolism is regulated by proteins, as are hormones and the various activities they control.\n\npassage 2:Regulations of body processes: Body proteins have highly specialized functions in the regulation of body processes. For example, hemoglobin, an iron bearing protein that is the chief constituent of red blood cells performs a vital role in carrying oxygen to the tissues.\n\npassage 3:Each hormone affects certain cells in your body, known as target cells. Such cells have specific receptors on which the hormone attaches itself to transmit the signals. An example of a hormonal protein is insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas to regulate the levels of blood sugar in your body.\n\n"}
