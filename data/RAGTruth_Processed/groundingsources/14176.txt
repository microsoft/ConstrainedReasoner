This is a great hole in the wall off State Street in Santa Barbara that renders art, good wine, and great tapas & pasta.  Very chill... not your typical 15-min meal. I really love this place and hope to keep coming when in Santa Barbara. They got the carbonara exactly like it's supposed to be.  \n\nBest of all, this is the best spot after work for a good glass of wine and some charcuterie. \n\nWell done Alejandra!"}]}
