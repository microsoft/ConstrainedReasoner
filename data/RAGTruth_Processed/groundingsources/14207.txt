I ordered a vodka cranberry and got cup of vodka with a splash our cranberry. I continued to order a screwdriver (can't mess that up) and got a cup of vodka with a splash of orange juice (it was cloudy) and on a separate occasion the first (and only) drink I ordered was made wrong while my husband's Jack and coke was all Jack with a splash of coke. Once I got my Bacardi mango (made correctly) it was alright, however the staff could use a lot more training."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2014-06-04 11:35:45", "review_text": "I came here for a beer with my dad and brother on a Tuesday night and quite enjoyed myself. It's fairly typical for a dive as far as atmosphere, amenities (yay pool table!), and drink selection goes, but it also seems to have a lot going on depending on the night you come. The bartender was a cool and helpful guy who didn't make me feel like a failure for my inexperience with beer. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area!"}]}
