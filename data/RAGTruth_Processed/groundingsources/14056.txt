DJ Fab or bunch of drunk Harley dudes, certainly a Fiesta or two.  \n\nAs many times as I have been there, I don't really know what it is?   Is it a restaurant?  Does it keep regular hours?   Is it a bar?  Do people go there and hang out on a Thursday night?   The bartenders have always been nice and the drinks have been good.  Not sure if they have glass because it seems that I am always served in a plastic cup.   I know I have eaten the food but I have zero recollection as to whether or not I enjoyed it, it is that forgettable.  \n\nI gave them two stars but I might go back and see if they deserve and upgrade."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2014-03-02 15:38:33", "review_text": "This is a great spot for a drink and some dessert. The dinner menu is decent but the price and size do not match. Don't come hungry, but do enjoy a specialty drink."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2011-08-29 21:40:05", "review_text": "my daughters and friends love to go there for karaoke :) so fun!
