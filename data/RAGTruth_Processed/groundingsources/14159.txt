You can pay more but you wont get better Japanese food!\nThe owner, Mr. Maida, is the BEST sushi chef ever- he drives to LA at dawn to pick up fresh fish every day. He adds little twists to tickle the taste buds, that he has invented...and great if you want sushi and friends dont, because they also offer good thai food too!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2012-06-27 16:17:56", "review_text": "Their food is not good and a mess. A woman, look like a owner but she keeps on the phone like she doesn't care what customer wants.\nStrongly not recommend."}]}
