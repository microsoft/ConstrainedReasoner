I was glad to be able to find this hole in a wall while walking with my group for lunch. \n\nI ordered the clam chowder bread bowl and fish and chips. Clam chowder was very delicious and fresh. The fish was crispy and made into perfection. \n\nThe best part is that you can order the food right away and simply sit at the tables outside to eat near the harbor where the ocean is so close. So if you want to get food in a quickly manner in order to have more time to explore the other areas in Santa Barbara, I would highly recommend Minnow Cafe."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2011-04-08 00:39:53", "review_text": "Hard to beat for a fast-food-type breakfast or lunch at the marina.

I mean, it's really not very good food unless you view it as cheap (but it's not).  Great thing, sitting outside by the harbor watching the BPs go by while you eat cheap (seeming) food.  Bad part, greasy spoon food served on paper plates by snarky staff with condiments that blow away...but it ain't cheap.  Guess that's Santa Barbara."}]}
