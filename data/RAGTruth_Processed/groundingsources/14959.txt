We stopped in at the end of a long day of tastings, so we just shared a 5 pour mixed tasting of 2 whites ('20 Sauvignon Blanc and a '20 Viognier) and 3 reds ('20 Grenache, '19 Tempranillo, and '20 Cab. Sauvignon).\n\nLenny, Skyenna's winemaker, poured for us and was an amazing host. We sat by ourselves in the far back of the lounge while he had a tasting bar full of people at the other end of the building. That didn't stop him from spending plenty of time with us discussing his wines and our interests. The wines we tasted were light to medium bodied and quite flavorful. If you're hungry or just want to create your own food/wine pairing experience, you can order food from the neighboring Italian restaurant, Lucky Penny.\n\nDefinitely worth your time to stop in and experience Skyenna's cool vibe atmosphere and Lenny's wines."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 20:10:43", "review_text": "Great place with a great vibe!

The owner was very nice and down to earth. The bathroom is a bit of a hassle being around the back but not to bad. It has some interesting art. It's a nice laid back feel. Walking distance from the water. There's street parking. You can check out a nearby restaurant as well. The wine is good. I got a bottle."}]}
