Other Coffee joints just don't get this.\nSo we had big cups of Joe, a cheddar scone and a cookie called a Hippie cookie.\nAm i witnessing a trend, a movement back here in SB to the Hippie Lifestyle? (Noted it in Whole Foods today also) hmmm.\nIn any event the Coffee today was redolent of dark, stewed cherries and Roasted Pecans as well as perfectly roasted (which is done in house) beans: beans roasted just this side of burnt so as to squeeze out all the flavor the beans posses. Likewise the Cheddar Scone and \"Hippie\" Cookie are natural items free of any kind of preservative. The scone is slightly crispy and chock full of cheese, onion and herbs. The cookie is crunchy and full of oats,coconut and berries.\nGreat time at the De la Vina Handlebar today. Btw: they have food pop ops here. In fact, months\nAgo i had Roman style pizzs here.\nCheers!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-24 05:24:24", "review_text": "I was in SB for the week and wanted to try their coffee since I hear a lot of great things about them and they seemed pretty popular. It wasn't too busy but there were a decent amount of people there. I ordered a vanilla oat latte and the cowboy brownie and it was good! The service was good and everyone was friendly. It is a bit more on the higher end price for coffee and their sizes are small but if you're looking for a cute place that has vegan options and serves good coffee, this is it."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-29 17:21:40", "review_text": "This place was fantastic! Hand down the best cafe in Santa Barbara. I am definitely coming  back here next time I'm in Santa Barbara. We heard good reviews for this place so gave it a try & boy it didn't disappoint!  \nIt was busy morning at the cafe so stood in line for 10 mins & waited for our drinks for 5-7 mins more. Drinks are $3 to $6. And it was worth the wait! Their lattes were amazing and the baked items were delicious. We ordered double lattes & it was just perfect! Airy, foamy & bursting with best espresso flavor. It came in their signature white cups. \n\nThis place is very cozy & has a wonderful friendly vibe. They have outdoor seating too where you get a beautiful view of Santa Barbara presidio. \n\nWe also ordered cinnamon roll, cookies & almond scone. We loved it all!"}]}
