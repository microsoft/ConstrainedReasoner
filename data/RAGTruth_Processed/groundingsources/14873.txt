Very spacious facility with nice clean restrooms and a couple parking options. The coffee is delicious and unlike a lot of coffee shops in the area, this one actually offers filling breakfast options - double check on social before visiting but this has been the case every time i've gone. Great spot near downtown! Will be back."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 05:33:30", "review_text": "I stumbled across this coffee shop as I was staying at an Airbnb nearby. I am so glad I did! The barista there was super nice-- she took my order and then also offered to make my matcha because she said she really liked to make them and that it was one of her favorite things. I honestly think it was the best matcha that I have ever had. I got a honey matcha almond milk situation and it was just sooo good.I would recommend checking this place out. The atmosphere is cute, the barista's are sweet and the drink was delicious! 10/10"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 19:09:53", "review_text": "I am a breakfast sandwich addict, and I have to say that the breakfast sandwich here is incredible. Toasted English muffin or bagel with scrambled egg, tomato, avocado, melted cheese, Mayo and lemon pepper. Shoutout to Herman for making them perfectly every time. Coffee is delish, toasts are good, and they have a great selection of baked goods. My hubby and I make the 45 minute walk to enjoy Lighthouse almost every Saturday. So good."}]}
