Professor at  School of the Art Institute of Chicago Issues Apology for Calling  "Pigs" and "Savages
Apology follows outrage over virulent social media rant
Dr. Mika Tosca, an associate professor of climate science at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, has issued an apology for inflammatory comments made on her Instagram story. The post, which has since been removed or expired, contained derogatory language directed at Israelis.
In the Instagram story, Tosca used degrading terms, referring to Israelis as "pigs," "savages," and "very, very bad people." She went further to denounce the entire Jewish state, asserting that they were "irredeemable excrement." The incendiary post was not only offensive but deeply divisive, particularly considering the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.
The Israel-Hamas war, marked by violence and suffering on both sides, has led to a surge in online vitriol and polarizing rhetoric. Hamas initiated a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, resulting in casualties, including civilians, and the taking of hostages. Israel, in response, launched a heavy bombardment of Gaza, causing further loss of life and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.
In the aftermath of her Instagram post, which sparked outrage and calls for her removal, Dr. Mika Tosca issued an apology. She expressed regret for her words, acknowledging the harm they caused and offering a specific apology to the Israeli people. She admitted her mistake in broadly placing blame on them for the conflict.
Bree Witt, a spokesperson for the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, issued a statement distancing the institution from Tosca's views, emphasizing that her hateful views are not reflective of the school's values. However, there was no comment on whether disciplinary action would be taken against the professor.
The offensive post was first brought to public attention by the nonprofit organization StopAntisemitism. They urged the school to consider the impact of such statements on Israeli and Jewish students.
Dr. Mika Tosca has not yet responded to requests for comment regarding the incident.
Tosca's case is not isolated, as several other professors have faced criticism for their comments on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
