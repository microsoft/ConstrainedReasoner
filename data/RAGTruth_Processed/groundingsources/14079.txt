You are a beautiful restaurant. I live in the neighborhood and really want you to be my regular spot. However, your new menu is the opposite of inspiring. A very smart chef recently perfectly answered the question, Why go out to eat? He said you go out to eat to try something new to you or to enjoy something made in a way you can't make at home. So... hamburgers? You reopen with hamburgers? This seems to me to be a pretty lazy, dumb, and cloying strategy to invite us back. You must assume we are unimaginative diners who want the lowest common denominator in our dining experience. To me it seems desperate. Tonight I made a really good hamburger at home. I have zero interest in having yours. It's not that I made the best burger ever, it's just that I make one really well and it's not that hard. If I want to pay someone else to make me one I will go to The Habit or to Hungry Cat. Please send your staff to Roebling Tea Room in Brooklyn or Freeman's Restaurant in Manhattan, copy their menu, and bring it here. That is something we don't have here. Your space is perfect for that type of food (foodie) experience. Please."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2011-10-23 21:27:26", "review_text": "I rarely order fish at restaurants, I've just had too many unpleasant experiences. \n\nHowever, I was told that I couldn't miss the paper wrapped halibut.  So I broke my rule...just for the halibut.\n\nIt was fantastic!  I highly recommend.\n\nShoot...it has already closed down."}]}
