There's a huge parking lot, which is also a plus. \n\nOsmanthus milk tea + boba: 9/10 the tea was delicious with it's floral scent. I was very satisfied with the texture of the boba. They look slightly smaller than regular boba, but it was perfectly soft and chewy. There were also multiple tiny bits of tea leaves in the drink that cockblocked my chews with the boba. Other than that, the flavoring was on point.\n\nSea salt cream foam black tea: 8/10 the drink reminded me so much of happylemon. It was very nostalgic drinking this. I think I'll get this with boba next time because the sipping lid isn't cream friendly haha. \n\nService: 10/10 they were able to answer multiple questions & were welcoming of adjustments (sweetness/ice level) to the drinks. Plus I haven't heard anywhere else play Keshi's songs"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-05 18:53:03", "review_text": "There's only a few boba places in Goleta/SB so I was really excited when a new location popped up! \n\nMy favorite boba drink is brown sugar milk tea and they had a whole menu for brown sugar drinks! I ordered their version of the brown sugar milk tea and it was really good! They also give you a good amount of boba. \n\nThey don't have flavors like taro, almond, and others that you would typically find at boba places, but they still have a good selection of drinks!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 02:11:33", "review_text": "This is my favorite Boba Tea house in SB now!!! Very authentic and the service is great. A bit pricey, but delicious!!! My favorites are: Oolong Milk Tea w/tiny boba, served hot or cold, and the Guava Fruit Tea. The guava fruit tea can be had with Yokult and they are both delicious. If you like Mexican Agua fresca's, you'll love the guava fruit teas. It tastes like a guava agua fresca with dulce the guallava. I have the fruit tea with green tea jelly. They are all very sweet so ask for 25 or 30 percent sweet if you don't like your yea's too sweet. \n\nI tried the Oolong Jelly Milk tea, didn't care for it, tasted like milk mostly. Also tried the mango yogurt tea, also not too good. Will continue to explore their menu as there is a lot to choose from!"}]}
