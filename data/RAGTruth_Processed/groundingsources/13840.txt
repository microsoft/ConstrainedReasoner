New York House Republicans Attempting To Remove George Santos From Congress
A Republican from New York state has made a privileged motion in the US House of Representatives to expel Republican representative George Santos from Congress following the recent filing of 23 new federal criminal counts against Santos, including accusations that he charged campaign contributor's credit cards without their consent as well as identity theft among others.
The justification for this move according to Representative Anthony D'Esposito of New York, backed by fellow New York Republicans Nick LaLota, Marc Molinaro, and Mike Lawler, is that George Santos is "not fit to serve his constituents as a United States representative." Beyond the criminal charges levied against him, George Santos had previously been accused that he fabricated much of his resume, likely in order to look good to voters in the 2022 election. As a result of this privileged motion, the vote on whether Santos will remain in Congress will occur during a legislative session this coming week. For his part, Santos has already indicated that he will not be resigning.
Despite the call for his removal, George Santos might be spared by Republican leadership in Congress due to the tight majority Republicans hold over Democrats, which is only 221 to 212. Indeed, alternatives to the vote for the Republican leadership include tabling the measure or to even refer it to a committee. Even if these options are not considered, it is possible Santos might be spared expulsion simply due to the need to attain 290 votes for the motion to pass. Even if all Democrats vote as such, there would still need to be 78 Republicans that disregard their leadership's desire to maintain as many Republican seats as they can in the House. With that being said, the controversy surrounding Santos will likely continue to deepen, even if he survives this attempt to remove him from Congress.
