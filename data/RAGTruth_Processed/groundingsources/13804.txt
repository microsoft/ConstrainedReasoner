'The Young and the Restless' Spoilers: Ashley Abbott Makes Fashionable Return
The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers reveal that Ashley Abbott made a stylish return to Genoa City. She popped up in the Abbott's mansion. As fans already know, Ashley escaped to Paris after her marriage to Tucker McCall (Trevor St. John).
She's had a change of heart after their wedding. Ashley feels that she made a huge mistake, especially when it cost her a relationship with her family. She became obsessed with seeking revenge on Diane Jenkins (Susan Walters) and taking control of Jabot.
Ultimately, Ashley wasn't happy. She left Genoa City for the City of Light, leaving Tucker jilted. On the Wednesday, October 25 episode of Y&R, Ashley shocked Diane and viewers when she popped up in the living room. According to Worn On TV, she made a stylish return in a camel high-slit turtleneck sweater by ASTR The Label that featured a long slit. The garment clung to the curves of her body. Her hot new look gave autumnal vibes.
Ashley paired the interesting look with dark denim skinny jeans. She looked at her phone as Diane walked in. The Young and the Restless spoilers on the SoapCentral.com Message Boards suggest that Ashley wants to help her family go up against Tucker. She suggests that she wants to see him again. However, Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) doesn't think it's a good idea with all the pain it's cost him. Ashley tells Jack that it's a good thing she's not listening to him.
