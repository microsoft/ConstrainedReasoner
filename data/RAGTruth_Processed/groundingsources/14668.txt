That is night and day better than most coffee house chains that at best might be 50 out of 90.  So that's actually very good.\n\nWe had been on auto ship-bill 5 LB bags for years and so far this year have shipped the wrong product twice which is why they have dropped from 4-5 stars to a 1 star review.  Having to tape up packages, print out labels and take them to UPS two times in a row to return them is a waste of time and energy.  Will give it one last try.  If they get it wrong 3 times in a row will stop doing business with them.\n\nFrom what I've recently discovered there are 90 point craft coffee makers out there that cost a little bit more for higher quality online that auto ship-invoice several times a year.  They're sending me a sample to try.  \n\nGreat personal service and if it turns out to be better will go with this company and cancel with ROCO.  After years of being a loyal customer disappointed and will update once I try another supplier.  A company has to look in the mirror when they drive customers away to seek out better and more reliable coffee companies."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 03:55:41", "review_text": "SB Roasting Co. makes some great coffee.  I'd stop by their lower off State Street location on occasion to grab a cup of coffee.  Used to use their coupon card but most of the employees did not know how to use their system.\n\nAfter multiple times of too much time and energy waiting for people to figure out what they were doing finally reverted to auto-bill-ship 5 lb bags.  \n\nIt was fine for 2-3 years and this year January 2022 they screwed up and shipped the wrong item 2 times in a row.  \n\nSo now I have to get a return address label a second time, print it out, tape the box up, tape the label on and drive it over to UPS.  I've canceled all future auto ship orders with SB Roasting Co.  They've lost a long time customer.\n\nGood bye and good riddance you're personnel have lost a long time loyal customer.  There's other coffee companies that actually care and take care of their customers."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-29 18:52:22", "review_text": "Cafe latte was great and coffee had great pickup.
