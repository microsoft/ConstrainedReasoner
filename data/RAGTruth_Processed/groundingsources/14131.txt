My wife and I were excited since we had loved their happy hour for years before they stopped it.  We always told our friends that they had the best happy hour in town.  So upon arrival we were seated and greeted by our server who was sweet.  We explained that we'd received an email about happy hour returning.  Our server said that happy hour drinks were offered.  I said what about happy hour appetizers?  She said no food items are included.  I told her that happy hour appetizers were what made the old happy hour great.  This review isn't a critique of the food, it was quite good but shame on the Sandbar for declaring that happy hour is back!  We will not be returning!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-12 15:31:36", "review_text": "The long line outside this Mexican restaurant all night made me feel like the poor Yelp reviews were wrong; but they weren't. Very cute atmosphere (lots of heaters and lighting outside, fun decor all around), great cocktails (spicy margarita was fire, literally), but the food did disappoint. The chips & salsa, and tacos were just average- not food I would return for. Customer service was just ok, but they were packed (and probably understaffed because of Covid)."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-08 00:14:32", "review_text": "Cassidy was the best!! She recommended all the delicious margaritas and guacamole! Her energy was so fresh and fun I want to come back and be in her section!"}]}
