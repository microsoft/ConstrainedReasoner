Loved their deli sandwiches until yesterday.  There's been some great people working there.  Last week and recently Ricardo waited on us.  He's great, swamped busy but went out of his way to accommodate us and his customer skills are impeccable. In the past their were two other women that were great and always happy to see them.  They worked hard and went out of their way to make things right...like when the deli was out of certain rolls happily went over to their bakery to bring them several they were out of.. I could see their frustration as they were out of veggies and some had gone rotten or completely out.\n\nWas waited on by a woman whose name as I recall was Margarita yesterday..  Was trying to order 3 sandwiches with bonus meat and pay the extra $1.00 for 3 foot long sandwiches as I ordered last week and for decades.  This  apparently new  woman had no clue what she's doing, argumentative and doesn't belong working in a deli where customer service is key.  Where do they find these incompetent employees?  The previous employees were always a pleasure to work with.  Pay them more and keep them!!!  Always happy to see them and greeted by a smile and thank you. Where do they find these new people?  Horrible experience and the only solution either than calling a manager over to explain things to this apparently new hire walked out.  Who needs the aggravation?  Went somewhere else for take out lunch.  Von's/Albertsons corporate managers need to pay close attention.  Retain your good employees if you want to keep your jobs as these stores will likely loose enough customers that they'll be shuttering stores on the path to going out of business."}]}
