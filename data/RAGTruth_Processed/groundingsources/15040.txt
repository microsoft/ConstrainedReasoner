Came here because read it was awarded the Michelin plate.  Later read the criteria for Michelin plate and it is based solely on quality of food; no mention of ambience or good service.  Of which Bibi Ji has very little.   We felt like we had been invited to dinner by college guys in their apartment, even down to the water spotted silverware and a can of unopened beer plopped down in front of us.\n\nWe opened the door to music blasting so we asked the host if we might sit outdoors.  We were seated out front in an area of metal chairs and tables on concrete enclosed by an iron fence.   The wine list had no by the glass prices listed and the waiter said that if  we wanted it by the glass we would just have to have what was already opened.  We asked for his suggestions for what to order and he said most people just order a variety of things to share so he did not offer any suggestions.  I started wondering if I was in the wrong place so checked out the review that mentioned a verdant patio.  Since I saw no sign of verdant, I asked the waiter about that.  He said \"oh, we have a patio in the back\" so we asked to be seated back there.  It was a little more pleasant with some flowering vines, but the music was still so loud that we had to yell to hear one another across the table.  Fortunately, the new waiter that came with the new location was much better and gave us some helpful suggestions.  We also asked if they had beer and he said yes, it just wasn't on the menu and rattled off a few.  \n\nAs far as the food goes, we thought the butter chicken and the Nan was great, as was the wine we ended up with, so perhaps the Michelin review was right as far as the food. However, I am giving it a 3 because of the lack of ambiance and poor service,"}]}
