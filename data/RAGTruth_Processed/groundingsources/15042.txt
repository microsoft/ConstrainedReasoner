My sister in law recommended this place and I tried the mango tropical with bee pollen and it was soooooo good and refreshing. This shop is super busy and I can see why. I think their prices are really reasonable! I can't wait to come back and Larry more. Highly highly recommend it. Will definitely return here soon when I'm in the area"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-06-26 22:34:50", "review_text": "This was my go to spot for the longest time for a peanut butter smoothie that'll basically replace my lunch. And whenever I ordered this, I'd specifically ask for soy blend not because I'm better than people it's literally because I'm lactose intolerant and don't want to spend hours of my life on the toilet. For some reason or another that didn't get through any of y'all today cause now I'm writing this as my butthole is burning due to how many times I've had to frequent the toilet. Please get your lives together."}]}
