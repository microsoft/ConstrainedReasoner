While the extremely pricey menu options were surprisingly good, the service in the whole restaurant was awful! Our server came to our table twice the entire night. Once to seat us, and once after we waited a very long time to get our check. He never came to check on us or ask how our food was even once! One table next to us even walked out before getting their food, or maybe they just never received it. A couple sat at the hostess stand for a good 10 mins before anyone greeted them as well. I'm surprised they didn't leave! It's too bad that the staff was so un attentive, because the food was actually pretty good! We will probably not be returning here:/"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2014-04-27 01:25:26", "review_text": "I frequent this location often on the weekends as a hang-out location with my friends. Over the many time I have been here, I have had a consistent experience with the food, the environment, as well as the service. \n\nWhen you open the menu, you will be quite surprised at the wide variety of choices available. Dishes range from crab-cakes to artichoke dips to filet mignons. Personally, I have tried the steaks many times at Holdrens, as well as a few of their select appetizers. The food is good for the price, typically around $20-$30 per individual (Combination of entree and appetizer). To me, having frequented many steakhouses in the United States such as Mastro's and Strip House, I would have to say that the quality and presentation of the slab of meat is on par with my expectations. It might be a little bit on the high side in terms of the food, but what can you expect, it is Santa Barbara. I expect the price to be more catered to the location when looking at the prices. Overall, I was happy with my food because it was delicious and I left the restaurant a happy customer. \n\nMany people on Yelp have been complaining about the poor service and lack of attention they received during their experience. During my few times at Holdren's, I have yet to encounter any problems. The service is excellent and attentive, and my table was always served and cared for properly. \n\nOverall, my experience at Holdren's was pleasant. I understand that it is located near Santa Barbara, which is prime real-estate. I expect many restaurants to institute a premium in their prices because of this. As a happy customer, I will continue to frequent this location with my friends when I do have the chance."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2014-04-16 20:31:00", "review_text": "My family went there for my brother's birthday. The wait staff was polite and courteous but the food was terrible. The steaks were burnt and the fish was undercooked. My mom and I split the bill and they ended up charging me for the entire bill!  I spoke with the manager a few days later and she said she would refund the portion I didn't owe, and instead CHARGED me again. Thank god I had enough money in my account to cover the charges. My bill was $86 and instead I got charged twice for a total of $411.08. Ridiculous, they lost me and my family's business forever."}]}
