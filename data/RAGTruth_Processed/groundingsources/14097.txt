Where do I start?\n\nIt's a dive for sure, filled with locals. I mean, who's going to cross town to the Mesa for a dive bar? It's my hood so there's that. \n\nOnce a dark and dirty bar that smelled like urine, now, with new owners, it's just a dark and dirty bar. No more pungent smell so that is a big win!\n\nBYOfood is a huge bonus. Taco Bell, Mesa Pizza, Meun Fan Thai, are all there for your pleasure. Oddly, and unlike other bars in town that don't serve food, The Cliff Room is NOT dog friendly. No one seems to know why. \n\nDrinks are not this strongest in town (Joe's, Harry's)  but not weak. Service is clickish so you'll want to invest in going a few times and meeting the team to get a quick cocktail. \n\nTouchTunes jukebox and 2 pool tables along with a few TVs will keep you occupied when your friends decide to put their head down for a drunk nap (highly NOT recommended). The bathrooms are as you would expect from a dive bar. I've seen worse but it's not a place you want to hang out in. \n\nThe Cliff Room is full of regulars and that's awesome. Especially on Thursday nights for karaoke. Don't expect a crowd until late. There's usually seats at the bar until 9 then it picks up and can be standing room only on a Tuesday night by 10:30. \n\nGive the Cliff Room a \"shot\" and especially if you're a Mesa kid. It's an easy bar to lose time in. And order up a \"Cliffy\"."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-09-07 12:47:53", "review_text": "Who doesn't love the cliff room?! It's a total dark divey bar where all the locals hang out at. \nYesssssss we go and over drink and meet a ton of people.\n\nIt's impossible not to. Everyone is friendly and cool. Especially the bartenders. \n\nThe beer is iced cold and the ambiance is my jam! It's always my late night stop."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-07-24 17:26:36", "review_text": "One of my favorite put stops before going home. What happened to Wendy on Tuesday nights? I would purposely do my laundry on Tuesdays and go to the Cliffy to see her during her only shift."}]}
