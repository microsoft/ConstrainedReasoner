Cereal Killer is the best gluten reduced (99%) beer I have ever had! I try any and all of them I can and this by far has the best taste. Even if you are not gluten sensitive you will really enjoy this beer, it's a yummy pale ale with light and refreshing notes to it, and it comes in pint size cans! Try it, you will be happy your did!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-09-20 10:07:46", "review_text": "I've only tried one of their beers so far but it was really good. I had the Czech Please. The food, snacks, and ice creams were delicious. The back area was very nice and clean. The service  was fast and friendly. I will definitely be back!"}]}
