{"question": "how to install grab bar shower", "passages": "passage 1:It's a single-level home, so the only thing that had to be done was make the shower safe. More grab bars. Installing a grab bar in a tiled shower is fairly straightforward, but there are a few tricks. First, decide where you want the bar. In a tub you'll probably need two bars, one to assist in getting into the tub and one to aid in sitting down, either on a seat or in the tub itself. Stand in the tub or shower and determine a comfortable height for the bar. Next, sit in the tub and determine the position where the bars are most helpful for getting in or out of the tub. Grab bars are equipped with flanges that are screwed to the wall with three hefty Phillips head screws.\n\npassage 2:To help start the hole where you want it, put a piece of masking tape on the tile to keep the business end of the drill bit from slipping until it makes a dimple in the tile. Fortunately, the location of the hole is not micrometer critical, since it will be covered by the grab bar mount.\n\npassage 3:Instructions. Determine where you want the grab bar to go and locate the studs in the wall. Using an electronic stud finder is the easiest way to find the studs. Place the grab bar so the mounting bracket screw holes are on a stud. Mark the holes with a marker. Do this on both ends of the grab bar.\n\n"}
