Stumbled on this store while camping at Carpinteria State Park campground. I love patronizing small businesses and this place does not disappoint. Delicious honey, candles, soaps, jewelry and more. They even have a chef in house for grab n go meals. The staff was so helpful and friendly. I'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-06-27 19:35:10", "review_text": "We found this little gem and were beyond impressed!!
