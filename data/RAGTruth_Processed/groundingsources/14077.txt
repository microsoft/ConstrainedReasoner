I had the hamburger and fries and it was delicious and I love the the fig marinade they put in the hamburger. I had an IPA white walls and I liked it. My husband had pork belly and he thought it was OK. Our waitress was great she was very good came back and checked on us a few times. The menu is limited and it is in a hotel which we didn't know so little hard finding it."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-21 18:00:35", "review_text": "This place was pretty nice the Decour was great,\n The service was fantastic my only complaint was some of the food. We first of had the brussels sprouts that were amazing for the  entr\u00e9es we had the pork chop which was good as well but the fish tacos that were very disappointing. The tacos were very small and no taste. My wife and I were disappointed but then the desert came which was a berry pie which was amazing they made up for the disappointing  tacos."}]}
