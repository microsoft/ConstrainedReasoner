I found El Taco Grande by accident, across the street from another taco shop that I've been to. I decided to try it and their food is excellent! So I wouldn't feel so stuffed, I went for their solo Chile Relleno and a crispy taco (not a combination plate). I also witnessed several others enjoying their food, noticeably carne asada burritos, a few other types of tacos, and Caldo 7 Mares (seven seas soup). YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-07-26 04:53:11", "review_text": "We popped in here because it was close by, and we are so glad we did.
