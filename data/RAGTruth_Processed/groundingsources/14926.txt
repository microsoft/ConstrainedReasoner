The staff is super nice though and the customers all come back often. However, the trivia nights are what really take the cake for me. Fun games, good times, and I can play along in my head while I'm working. Should I have been focusing on work? Yes. Was the trivia too tempting? Absolutely. Good vibes, good fun, and probably good drinks"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-10-29 02:48:39", "review_text": "I thought the setting was nice and the guy behind the counter was very courteous and had a lot of information.  However the Ciders themselves lacked flavor in my opinion.  A couple were so bland they were almost unpleasant.  I'd hope that the Brewer will craft some new ciders that really pack a punch with great fruit flavor."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-25 23:26:53", "review_text": "As a cider enthusiast this is one of, if not the best, cider I've ever had. Especially you like dry ciders like me. The flavors are all amazing and the space is cool. The RBF and Mamosa rock and the people are nice. Run, do not walk, to this place. Can't wait until they distribute to LA!"}]}
