Im very disappointed that it closed because it was a great spot for me and coworkers to go for lunch. Will there ever be another firehouse subs in Goleta/Santa Barbara?? Also I'm very curious as to what happened to the mural with the gaucho and the firemen hanging on the wall. Any information on either would be much appreciated!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2014-12-01 22:54:44", "review_text": "FIREHOUSE SUBS IS CLOSED!\n\nI was bummed when I stopped by for the Engineer sandwich, and they had closed their doors.
