Why on earth would anyone serve pickled ginger with artificial sweetener? Maybe I'm the only person in the world who has an extreme distaste for artificial sweetness, but my taste buds are ruined.

But this sealed the deal that I will never go there again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-05 02:21:13", "review_text": "I ordered a small hot sake, Large Sapporo, salmon skin hand roll, tuna, grilled tuna and miso soup. It was very filling. The hand-roll was made to perfection, very tasty and nice and warm. Tuna was fresh and had the right amount of ginger and wasabi. Service was friendly and welcoming. They didn't rush but asked me if I was okay / needed anything throughout my dining experience."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-15 18:38:26", "review_text": "Cool little sushi place great service all the employees were fast and friendly as well.
