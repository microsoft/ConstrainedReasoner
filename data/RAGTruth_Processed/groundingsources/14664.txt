Nothing earth-shatteringly unique, but the food is done competently and taste home-made and not mass market.\n\nbaked apple - a backed apple wrapped with filo crust and placed upon a bed of caramel and topped with whipped cream.  very good.\n\nomelet with cheese and ham/bacon.  Also very good, not spectacular but a well execute omelet\n\noatmeal - again very standard with currants/raisins and sliced bananas.  I think it might have included a bit of pearl barley\n\nThe crostini (vegetable) was not great.  Lacking in much flavor.  That was the one standout disappointment.\n\nThe service is a little slow here, so don't expect to be in and out.  We waited about 20 minutes for our food."}]}
