We were very impressed with the seafood pasta . The lobster was incredible!  Loved the grilled taste ! \n\nIt does get alittle warm in the dining area for my liking / but it's a nice place to dine at . Management walked around helping the staff and greeting customers- you don't see that very often !"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-11 05:32:29", "review_text": "We came on a cold winter rainy day after being disappointed at the SB Shellfish company (crazy long lines) . It seemed most of their customers here had the same experience! \n\nStarted out not in a good mood but we're pleasantly surprised by their seafood stews  - a bit pricy but worth it - sharable for two. They don't have bread on the menu but our waiter had the kitchen slice up a large sourdough and toasted them for us for $6. They were perfect with the stew. I highly recommend these two items. \n\nWe also ordered the hamburger and would it recommend it at all - not much taste unless you pour ketchup all over. The fries were excellent, however."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2022-01-04 01:28:26", "review_text": "We visited today and thought we lucked out with a great server but we were so wrong. Omar.. seemed nice at first and then when we ordered from happy hour menu he changed his demeanor. In fact with the table behind us because they didn't order from dessert menu and instead wanted a drink refill he responded super snarky. The food was so so. Would not recommend."}]}
