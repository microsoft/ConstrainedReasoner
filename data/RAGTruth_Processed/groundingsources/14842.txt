Also, you'll pay extra for the buttermilk aioli (or their menu didn't display accurate prices, who knows).\n\nAnd, it took longer than we expected (~30 mins) to get the food after ordering -- we missed a bit of the concert opener, but c'est la vie."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-14 21:59:57", "review_text": "Holy moly!\nKorean chicken sandwich and fries were delicious.  I'm only sad that we were going to the Bowl for a concert afterwards, and I had to leave my leftovers behind.  A friend had the burger with fries and also raved.  I can't wait to go back.  It took a little while for the food to come out, as they seemed to be busy with pickup orders.  Absolutely worth the short wait."}]}
