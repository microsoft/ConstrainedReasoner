They have a semi-separate area with a fire place that was great for an anniversary celebration with my girl. Wine list is decent but I felt they didn't offer enough wines by the glass. Food was just good (7 out of 10). She had the Salmon special of the day which was average. I had the Chicken Vesuvio which I really liked. I wanted to try the local wines so I had the Santa Barbara Syrah and she had the S.B. Chardonnay. Both were reasonably priced and well worth it!\n\nTotal for the night was $65 for two entrees, two glasses of wine, and Tiramisu (which was excellent).\n\nHighly recommended for a nice place to have dinner. Would've been 5 stars if the food was better."}]}
