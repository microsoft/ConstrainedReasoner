We stopped in for lunch one day and wanted to 1st wash up and use the rest room. It appeared that it was not occupied however we asked 1st. We were told (with no disrespect to the culture but with a difficult to understand accent) that it was \"out of order\" we sensed differently since we saw someone exit the room after obviously using the facility. What? An employee can use the restroom and exit while picking away but lie to us about it being out of order? Too late to simply walk out since my son had already ordered and paid but my wife and I obviously changed our minds about ordering after seeing this employee exiting the restroom while picking for whatever. At least he put on his pocketed pre used plastic gloves when he returned to prepare food."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-06-03 20:24:39", "review_text": "I have always had good service here and every once in a while they add a free cookie to a delivery meal.
