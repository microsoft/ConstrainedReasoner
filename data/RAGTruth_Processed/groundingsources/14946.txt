This place was pretty much completely outdoors, so dress warm if it's cold out.  But each grouping of seats had some source of heat to keep you warm.  The seating was a fun mix of eclectic chairs and couches.  They also allowed all 3 of the dogs we had with us to come inside the bar area and hang out while we enjoyed our drinks.  I tried one or two with mezcal in them and thought they were lovely.  The rest of the group tried other various drinks and each were equally as good as the rest.  I really appreciated the aesthetic of all the craft cocktails and the chill vibes."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2020-03-15 19:59:28", "review_text": "Good atmosphere. Fun, hip decor. However the service is awful. Waited for 10 minutes at bar without being acknowledged   Much room for improvement. I can see why the place isn't that packed on a Friday night. Hope they do fix the issues because the place is fun"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-03-06 14:35:50", "review_text": "This place is unassuming from the street but so so awesome once inside! We loved every single drink we ordered. The decor was so cute and the fire pits and heaters made it super comfy in the winter."}]}
