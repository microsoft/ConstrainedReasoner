But I was really blown away this year by their Galette Des Rois (King's Cake) to celebrate Epiphany (January 6). \n\nI've had the traditional Mardi Gras style cake many times, either homemade or store bought. However, Renaud's has really WOWED me with the french style King's Cake!! It's everything I love about french pastries, buttery, light, delicious almond filling! It is just fantastic and so fun. \n\nThe cake comes with two adorable little figurines to hide in the cake and a gold crown! It's such a fun cake to share and delicious with coffee. I really enjoyed this seasonal item and I can't wait to order another next year."}]}
