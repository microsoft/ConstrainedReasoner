Why Will Every Mainer Be Getting an Alert on Their Phone This Week?
If you suddenly find your phone, radio, or television interrupted with a sudden alert on Wednesday, Oct. 4, don't be alarmed. This nationwide interruption is just a test – a part of FEMA's routine to ensure the reliability and efficiency of its Emergency Alert System.
Testing Times: When to Expect the Alert
Scheduled for 2:20 p.m. EDT, this alert will roll out across various time zones, including:
1:20 p.m. CDT
12:20 p.m. MDT
11:20 a.m. PDT
Phones will display a clear message: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” Spanish-speaking users can expect the notification to read: “ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA del Sistema Nacional de Alerta de Emergencia. No se necesita acción.”
That Familiar Tone: A Blast from the Past
Jeremy Edwards, FEMA's spokesperson, stated that the alert will be the very same audio tone familiar to countless Americans. Rooted in history, this unique sound dates back to 1963, established by President John F. Kennedy, marking the inception of the original Emergency Broadcast System.
Interestingly, this tone isn't just for nationwide alerts. Over 1,700 local, state, territorial, and tribal authorities use this very sound for localized emergency alerts.
Why The Test?
The main aim of these tests is to evaluate the effectiveness of FEMA's alert systems. Conducted once every three years, the last test was as recent as Aug. 11, 2021. A potential reschedule is in the cards for Oct. 11, should there be severe weather or significant events.
Who Will Get the Message?
While the majority will receive the alert, there are exceptions. Phones that are off, set to airplane mode, or not within cell tower coverage might not get the alert. Additionally, some older phones might miss out, especially if the user is on a call.
A Word of Caution
It's vital to differentiate real alerts from casual references. The FCC recently proposed a hefty fine for FOX, resulting from the inappropriate use of EAS tones during an NFL promo segment. The intent is clear: these tones have a unique purpose, and its sanctity must be preserved.
In conclusion, come Wednesday, when that familiar tone sounds, remember it's a test. Stay informed, stay safe, and always be prepared.
