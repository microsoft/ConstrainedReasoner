We arrived at noon and were the only ones there. The large and lush patio was great since the weather was nice, and my bowl of spicy soup noodles hit the spot. \n\nI used to live in Hong Kong and have traveled in Asia quite a bit. While I can't quite call what I ate \"traditional\" in some respects, it was delicious. For around $11.80, I got a big bowl of tasty mala soup (at just the right spice level after I asked for it \"da la\" \u5927\u9ebb) with four ingredients. \n\nI chose vermicelli, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, and tofu rolls. Each was super tasty! I was a little disappointed as I had asked the friendly cashier/server if the tofu roll was the crispy beancurd roll from hotpot and he said yes, but it wasn't. It was more like rolled tofu skin--still tasty though. The broccoli was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the cabbage soaked up the delicious mala oils while the vermicelli provided the \"umph\" to the dish. The soup came topped with sliced spring onions and a generous dollop of chili sauce with sesame seeds. \n\nA little while into our meal, the server came over with two cups of mung bean soup for my friend and I. He said the chef had decided to make up a batch and gave it to us on the house. It was a nice balance of sweet to match the spicy soup, and had a liberal serving of perfectly cooked mung beans at the bottom. \n\nThe only downside was the place's lack of nice utensils. Though I ordered my meal \"for here,\" it came with a small plastic spoon and disposable wooden chopsticks. I carry my own chopsticks, so no worries there (BYO people, be green!), but the spoon was sad. I want to eat a lovely soup like that with a proper Chinese soup spoon that has room for me to arrange the perfect bite with my chopsticks. The silly little plastic one just didn't cut it. Despite that, I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch, and ate every bite. I think I'll be back; maybe I can try the jian bing (Chinese crepe) next time."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2019-11-13 02:26:06", "review_text": "The food here is ok but not great, and kind of expensive for what it is. We tried both the mala tang and the dry pot (peanut-based sauce). The base is free, and you pay for the items you chose to add in (minimum of 4). They assemble your hot pot or dry hot pot in the kitchen before bringing it out in a regular bowl. The mala soup base was not very numbing, and the flavors of the base didn't seem very incorporated into the mix-ins.\n\nThey also have jian bing and some appetizers, which we didn't try--some of their other items may be better."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2019-05-28 02:06:56", "review_text": "I believe the restaurant will not last long, even their food is not bad, because the price is much higher than expected."}]}
