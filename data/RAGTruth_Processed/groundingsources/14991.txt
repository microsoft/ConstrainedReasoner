But the one in Montecito is still open and serving great food.  Lots of vegetarian items to choose from that are exceptionally good!  Love the fresh, organic salads. The daily vegetable risotto is always fantastic. Have been eating at the restaurant on State Street for years, but will now go to the Montecito location."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-01-26 21:45:03", "review_text": "A Montecito local's favorite, this is a relaxing, private cafe with a sweet outdoor patio and nice selection of healthy (some organic) food and treats.
