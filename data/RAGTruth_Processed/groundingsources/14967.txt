The best way is to find someone you trust. Enter the owner of Still. I didn't catch his name, but as I perused the store, admiring the various bar bits and bobbins, he kindly shared pieces of information surrounding various things, while still giving me space to browse.\n\nHighly recommended if you want to pop in for a chat or pick up some wonderful (and original) barware."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-04-15 16:02:24", "review_text": "I have been in this shop several times and have always had great experiences.
