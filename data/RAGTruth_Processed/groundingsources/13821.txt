Seeking Justice for Kaysera: A MMIW Story
August 2021 would have marked Kaysera Stops Pretty Places' 20th birthday, but instead, her family observed the second anniversary of her tragic death near the Crow Reservation in Montana. Her family has been on an unwavering quest for answers and justice, yet their path has been fraught with frustration.
Leading the charge in the fight for justice is Kaysera's aunt, Dr. Grace Bulltail. She remembers Kaysera as a kind-hearted soul who faced immense challenges living on the reservation. However, the public report released in August 2021 on her death has been criticized by the family, who believe it focused more on Kaysera's character than conducting a thorough investigation.
The report included witness statements describing an argument involving Kaysera and three others. An autopsy report couldn't pinpoint the exact cause of death but found ethanol in her blood. Equally troubling is the lack of a missing person report and minimal investigative effort in the days following her disappearance.
In October 2019, the formation of a Missing and Murdered Persons Task Force rekindled substantial investigative efforts. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Interior's BIA Office of Justice Services became involved in the case.
Kaysera's case casts a spotlight on the broader issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. It serves as a stark reminder of the hurdles Indigenous communities, especially women, encounter in their pursuit of justice. The fight for justice remains ongoing, and Kaysera's family urges support and awareness. This case underscores the urgent need for systemic changes to dismantle the obstacles to justice for Indigenous women. The fight continues, and the names of women like Kaysera must not fade into oblivion.
