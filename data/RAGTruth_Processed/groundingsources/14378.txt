{"question": "what are some physical and chemical properties of magnesium and calcium", "passages": "passage 1:The chemical properties of calcium are reacts with oxygen and reacts with water. There are other chemical properties, but not all of them are true for calcium.These are the two that I know.he chemical properties of calcium are reacts with oxygen and reacts with water. There are other chemical properties, but not all of them are true for calcium.\n\npassage 2:Chemical and Physical Properties of Magnesium. Magnesium is one of the most important elements that is present in many compounds as well as alloys. It is widely used as a chemical reagent, desulfurization agent, and vital ingredient in fireworks.It finds multiple applications due to its unique chemical and physical properties.s mentioned in the chemical properties, magnesium is also present in many other compounds like dolomite, magnesium carbonate (that is also known as magnesite), and magnesium sulfate (which is also known by the name epsomite).\n\npassage 3:Calcium: Physical Properties --silver-grey metal. melts at 840\u00b0C, boils at 1484\u00b0C to produce monatomic gas. density 1540 kg/m^3. Conductor of electricity but a poor one com \u2026 pared to most other metals.Diamagnetic. Chemical properties -- tarnishes rapidly in air to produce a powdery, flaky oxide coating.Reacts steadily with water, giving off bubbles of hydrogen and a solution/slurry of alkaline, sparingly soluble calcium hydroxide. Flammable at high temperatures with oxygen, or air.an also burn in nitrogen to form calcium nitride or carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate. Nearly all compounds are in oxidation state +2, and the water chemistry of calcium is dominated by the hydrated Ca(2+) ion.\n\n"}
