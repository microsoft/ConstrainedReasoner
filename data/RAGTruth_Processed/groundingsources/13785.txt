I'm vegan, and it's actually rather tough to find vegan sweet snacks in IV, so I was excited to try Campus Point. Funnily enough, when I headed over for a studying session, they were sold out! Guess those cookies must be good. \n\nHowever, the coconut charcoal mocha I tried was delicious--and vegan! Staff were super friendly, and I appreciated the indoor and outdoor seating options. Also, there's a toilet, which is a bonus, and the empanadas looked really yummy. I'll have to try one next time I visit."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-01-08 22:10:42", "review_text": "Finally a place in Isla Vista with a bathroom!\n\nBeyond the much needed bathroom this cafe offers a plethora of interesting drinks on top of providing all the basics. I got an iced charcoal mocha that was perfect to get rid of my mid afternoon slump."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-01-08 06:06:23", "review_text": "This is such a cute lil coffee shop in the heart of IV. There's tables inside and outside to do work or chill, and sometimes there's an open mic outside. Prices are average for your local non-corporate coffee shop. The menu has a wide variety of drinks, and sometimes they post about BOGO's or 50% off on their instagram page. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves coffee and needs a place to study!"}]}
