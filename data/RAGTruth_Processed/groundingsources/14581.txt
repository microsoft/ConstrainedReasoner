The produce looks so different than most grocery stores - it seems to radiate freshness.    That freshness translates to flavor.    There are some breads available not in most stores, they even will special order breads you want from Ethnic Bread.    Parking is so easy, there's plenty of employees to help.  John Dixon and staff - thank you.   It's also nice to know one is shopping at a locally owned market - that's a plus.   Recommended highly.  My neighbors say the meats and fish are excellent too.  Don't forget to join their loyalty program also."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-07-04 01:00:01", "review_text": "Check your receipts!  I was not only charged for 54 more green onions than I bought, I was also charged a $7.50 phone order fee (I didn't order by phone, I just walked in and shopped).  Once I noticed the charge I had to drive all the way back and the only compensation I was offered was the original $.89 green onion.  I used more gas than that driving all the way back.  If I had \"accidentally\" walked out with $56 worth of goods I didn't pay for i would not only have to return them all but I'd also be arrested.  Poor customer service."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-05-11 03:42:54", "review_text": "I bought some fresh and organic vegetables, the price is more expensive than the supermarket, but the quality is very good.  I really like the grapefruit juice they squeezed by themselves."}]}
