On a recent visit to SB, we went in for dinner. First of all, the service was outstanding--warm and welcoming, eager and friendly, very caring and kind people, from the hostess to our server to the manager--everyone was so very sweet, it made up for our letdown with the food. To be fair, we live in the Bay Area with Kokkari in S.F. and Evvia in Palo Alto, and we'd had an unbelievable time at Petros Solvang--so we went in with expectations off the chart. Maybe this was the problem--it wasn't that their food was intrinsically bad; it was good. It just didn't sparkle, didn't blow our minds . . . the watermelon and feta salad was good, albeit not super alive with flavor. The grilled octopus was a good dose of protein, though with slightly muddled flavor (we were expecting it to be charred and tender), which is a tough call for octopus. While we were looking over the menu, we didn't see lamb listed, and were expressing disappointment to each other. Our server who had not yet come to our table, and was doing something else at the adjacent table, overheard us, and came over to reassure. He was just so sweet: going over not one or two, but three different lamb options. I mean, seriously, what kind of Greek restaurant doesn't have lamb, right? Petros had terrific lamb options: we had the lamb loin or was it the chops? They were good; again, not so memorable that I'd track down a postcard and write home about them. But they were good enough that we scarfed down everything :-) At some point during our dinner, someone spilled water everywhere near our table on the floor, and the manager was on top of it, asking someone to mop it up (before we tripped). We didn't stay for dessert, but I'd give anything to live near Petros, and I could go in for lunch anytime, we'd have a ball. Btw, the next day we were having dinner across the street at sunset, and Petros was the site for an outdoor wedding party/reception. We watched a gorgous and touching show--traffic stopped on the street while the bride and groom took photos, her white train trailing the street, veil blowing in the breeze . . . I damn near cried."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-07-10 22:31:18", "review_text": "Awesome food and service! Just got back from Greece and this restaurant met our expectations of traditional Greek dishes."}]}
