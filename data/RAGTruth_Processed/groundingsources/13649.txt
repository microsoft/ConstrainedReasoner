So what I noticed is lots of restaurants close fairly early and driving up and down the street plus walking in asking if restaurants are opened !! And most close early !! So Finally found this Thai Restaurant opened past 8:30pm and I walk in and was seated right away and it was really slow because it was 43 degrees outside and freezing so I guess no one wants to be outside eating !! Well for us we were fairly hungry and needed some food in our stomach !! As a foodie I always enjoy trying new restaurants and eating at new places !! So I Decided on ordering the Pan Thai Noodles and I have to say it is one of the more popular dishes here !! Cooked well and flavorful !! Next I got some appetizers which were the delicious Spring Rolls which they cut in pieces for you to dip into there delicious Peanut Sauce which comes on the side !! Those spring rolls were yummy !! Last I got the Red meat Wonton Soup which hit the spot !! Tasted pretty dang good !! I also noticed the decor was decorated with a lot of elephants around and I guess it's the symbol for this Restaurant !! But I do suggest you give it a try and enjoy the delicious Thai food they serve here !! One more thing the parking was not bad but you have to park on the side street and the first 90 Minutes are Free !! Well my overall experience was good and I definitely recommend this Restaurant to everyone to try  !! And if I happen to be in Santa Barbara again I might have to stop in once again !!"}]}
