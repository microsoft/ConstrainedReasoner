It cost $4.99 and was loaded with scrambled egg, cheese, and your choice of meat.  I selected bacon.  I liked the sandwich and it came out quick.   The english muffin was hearty and soft, yet well toasted.  The place itself has ample seating (indoor and out) and two televisions.  I came in the early hours of the morning so it was practically empty.   The selection of candy and snacks was good.  Plenty of beverage selection, bottled, fountain, and tap drinks."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-09-23 04:59:11", "review_text": "This is always our stop while traveling through. The flavors are as fun as the sandwich names. I love the different creations they have come up with. I highly recommend!"}]}
