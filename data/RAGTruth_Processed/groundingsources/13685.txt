My ice cream tasted like water and was icy and melted. The owner looked miserable and was upset when he gave me the wrong ice cream and when I said I ordered pumpkin he rolled his eyes. He did not wear gloves and the ice cream cone did not have a paper wrapping. His fingers were bloody and he had dirt under his finger nails. I was grossed out when he handed me the ice cream and I had to throw the entire thing out. Disgusting. This store is completely unsanitary. DO NOT GO. He did not even wear a mask"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-07-16 16:51:17", "review_text": "Upon walking into Here's the Scoop with my mother and two daughter's we were excited to try a scoop of gelato in the quaint town of Montecito. We walked in and smiled and said hello to the owner an older man who did not respond or greet us upon arrival. He looked miserable and we didn't feel welcome at all. Even my toddler noticed that he wasn't friendly. There weren't any seats to sit outside so we opted to sit inside as I had my two younger children with me. The entire time we were sitting inside it was extremely awkward and quite. For it being an ice cream shop you would expect some cheerfulness. Not here. I also noticed he gave himself a three dollar tip which I did NOT authorize. I wouldn't have normally disputed a charge like this but it's the principle. He definitely has a reputation for this after reading all of his bad reviews. Please DO NOT support this small business."}]}
