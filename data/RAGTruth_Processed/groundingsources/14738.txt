Every time I come I usually either get the spicy seafood ramen or the beef curry ramen. I got the beef curry ramen this time and the flavor definitely tasted good. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the lack of beef it had. They only gave me a few cut up pieces that were really small."}]}
