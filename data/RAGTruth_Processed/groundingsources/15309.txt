{"question": "examples of a recessive gene", "passages": "passage 1:Examples of Recessive Traits. We know many examples of traits controlled by recessive alleles; however, as scientists are more thoroughly studying the genetics of traits, they are finding that many have multiple genes and alleles associated with them, instead of just one gene with two alleles as explained above. recessive trait is the phenotype that is seen only when a homozygous recessive genotype for the trait of interest is present. This means that an individual must have two recessive alleles for the gene that determines this trait of interest.\n\npassage 2:Another way to define a recessive trait is one that is never expressed by the heterozygous genotype. For example, the heterozygous genotype for earlobe type (Ee) produces detached earlobes because the dominant allele (E) hides the effects of the recessive allele (e). recessive trait is the phenotype that is seen only when a homozygous recessive genotype for the trait of interest is present. This means that an individual must have two recessive alleles for the gene that determines this trait of interest.\n\npassage 3:However, for males, there only needs to be one copy of an X-linked recessive gene in order for the trait or disorder to be expressed. For example, a woman can carry a recessive gene on one of the X chromosomes unknowingly, and pass it on to a son, who will express the trait:Therefore, half of the daughters have the gene and can pass it to the next generation.The other half do not have the gene and, therefore, cannot pass it on.owever, for males, there only needs to be one copy of an X-linked recessive gene in order for the trait or disorder to be expressed. For example, a woman can carry a recessive gene on one of the X chromosomes unknowingly, and pass it on to a son, who will express the trait:\n\n"}
