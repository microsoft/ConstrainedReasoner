Great way to meditate and relax. I was particularly impressed, however, with the lovely, heart-centered service.

What a lovely experience!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-03-22 01:57:02", "review_text": "I would highly recommend Danielle for facials to everyone I know.

We came here looking for a great massage and all we got was good decor. The cafe was good (between the two of us, we had coffee, tea, and oatmeal - oatmeal was good but nothing special). \n\nWe had Lizzie who was supposed to \"the best\" massage therapist, but she definitely wasn't:\n-The oil she used was cold - not a pleasant surprise to start off the massage.\n-I got \"deep tissue\" ...I had to tell her twice for more pressure - shouldn't have to ask for that for a deep tissue massage. Even after asking for more pressure, she didn't do it. Come to find out, the person I came with who got a Swedish massage said Lizzie's pressure was weak and limp as well! From the way she timidly handled my head and neck to how I could uncomfortably feel her nails in my skin, everything screamed that Lizzie had either never given a massage before or was extremely inexperienced. \n\nSUCH a disappointment considering we were looking forward to a great massage AND considering we paid $135 EACH. Big disappointment."}]}
