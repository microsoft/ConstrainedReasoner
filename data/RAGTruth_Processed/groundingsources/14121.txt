It was easy to order the burrito so it could be vegan. Delicious fresh veggies mixed with natural brown rice and black beans. The soup was naturally vegan and gluten free, and yummy. Friendly \"help yourself \" environment. Even the patrons seemed like people I would want to be surrounded by. To top it all off, they had my favorite Virgil's root beer. If I lived in this town, it would quickly become my favorite place to eat."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2014-10-17 23:34:58", "review_text": "Went there this past weekend with five people. A solid lunch place for salads, soups and sandwiches that are fresh. But, the chocolate milk shake was awesome. And, we noticed at least four other tables ordering shakes. This place is all about fresh and healthy, but the chocolate shake is a great bet. We had fish tacos, garlic potato soup, turkey sandwich and the yogi special. Sandwiches come with blue tortilla chips and salsa. Everything is fresh like you made it at home. \n\nOrder when you arrive and then sit down at a table and wait for the staff to bring you your food. The service is good, friendly and quick. Help yourself to ice water and add a lemon. Good place for families, not too loud."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2014-09-22 18:46:00", "review_text": "The food is edible but definitely not memorable. We came here because we could bring our dog on the patio.  The girls working the register were really sweet so good customer service. I know this review is short but really not much more to say!"}]}
