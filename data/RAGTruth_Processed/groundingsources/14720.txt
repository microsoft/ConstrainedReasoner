We stayed in town a few years ago and found this gem. It is one place you will never get old of. My husband has a go to of - peanut butter smoothie with dragon fruit. However, I always order a different smoothie each time. When ever we pass this town we always stop by. So sad that this olace has closed down. Hope they open another one soon."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-03-09 21:54:44", "review_text": "I wish I could rate them a zero!!! This place was great and has great bowls but so disapointed in the customer service!! They refused to serve me because they \" were too busy\" I was willing to wait and be patient, nor was it close to closing it was mid-day but yet the young man continued to say \" we are busy and wont be able to take your order\"  I was not impatient or expecting to be served right away, knowing these bowls and smoothies are all handmade. I've worked in the food business and know it can get overwhelming at times but never refuse a happy and patient customer. I just was in complete shock that he wasn't willing to serve a local customer who has been in more than a dozen times.  Thumbs down to you young man! Backyard bowls on the other hand is great and has AWESOME customer service."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2015-11-07 22:16:53", "review_text": "Yummy smoothies and bowls but the service is just too slow. Often times there isn't even a line and it takes forever to get our order. One time I was the only customer in there and went up to ask where my order was ten minutes after ordering and they had forgotten to make it. Not good."}]}
