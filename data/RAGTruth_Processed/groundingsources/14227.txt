Which do you chose, vanilla or chocolate? Both!!! You be the judge, especially when they are warm right out of the oven!!\nMake sure to pick up the empanadas as well, pumpkin filling or pineapple, even vanilla pudding. They are all delicious. Polvorones and the marranitos are my families favorites. \nIf Pan Dulce is too sweet for you, La Tapatia also offers menudo and pozole on weekends, along with other delicious Mexican dishes which they serve on a daily basis. \nI love supporting  my neighborhood and the LatinX community, they work hard to serve Santa Barbara and Goleta county. \nAlways greeting you with a smile, La Tapatia Bakery is a great choice for any craving you may have."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-04 17:22:00", "review_text": "Best Mexican food I've found in town. There's a long line out the door for a reason. I almost don't want to leave this review because I want to keep this place for myself!  Caldo de Res, burritos, nachos (fantastic), tortes are all just delicious. It's once of those places where you really want to try other things but you're so in love with what you've already tried it makes for difficult decisions."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-10-02 12:18:22", "review_text": "Would you like to pay $26 + $4 or tip for a burnt torta, two drinks and terrible presentation? Then check out La\nTapatia! $26 dollars shouldn't look like this. I'm this picture, the camarones a la diabla were around $13. Came with gummy tortillas. The flavor was there yes but the presentation was terrible. It seriously looks like you lift the lid up on the throne and this is what you see inside after a long night. \n\nNever coming back again.\n\nNo vale la pena comer algo que est\u00e1 quemado y se parece mal."}]}
