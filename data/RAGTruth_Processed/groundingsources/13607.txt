This restaurant is located in the Hyatt hotel.  \n\nWe ordered Lamb meatballs, which was delicious and flavorful.  We also shared a Bistro burger, which contained bacon, cheese, mixed greens, tomato, onions and brioche bun.  The patty was juicy and tender.  \n\nI ordered a fruity cocktail, but I can't recall the name of it.  The cocktail  contained berries and it wasn't too strong, but had enough alcohol.  My other half got a mojito and said it was a great tasting cocktail.  \n\nOur server, Edgar was really attentive and gave us great recommendations.  \n\nAlso, if you check in on Yelp, you get 50% off an item when you purchase an entree.  \n\n*Parking- you can either park at the hotel for $25 a night and walk to this restaurant for find street parking*\n\nAlso, Happy Hour is from 4pm-7pm daily- small plates are $5, all beers are $4, all house wine are $5 and all well cocktails are $6 or Bartender's choice cocktail for $8."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2015-12-22 02:36:35", "review_text": "The waiter specifically suggested \"the salmon dish\".\n\nThe dish cooked too dry and was not fresh.\n\nThere are fish bones in the meat."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2015-11-11 22:51:42", "review_text": "So not sure if they the restaurant was under contruction or whatever but happy hour ended up being at the bar area by the pool. Which was fine with us. \n\nWe got the brussel sprouts which were really tasty. We got the wings which had a thick herb topping on it. The wings were crispy and good but the herb topping and sauce were kind of lacking. We also got a salad that I cant remember in detail but I remember there were apples in it. It was crisp and refreshing. The drinks were kind of weak which was disappointing."}]}
