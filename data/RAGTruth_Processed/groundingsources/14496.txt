The food overall was on the salty side, but not as bad as the mandarin palace on la cumbre. The food was also pretty oily but okay for once in a while. Watch out for old waitress trying to persuade you into ordering expensive dish. We got tricked one time and ended up ordering roasted duck but we just wanted a bowl of noodles in the first place. Never going back again!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-08-31 21:47:01", "review_text": "Best Chinese food and buffet in town. A wide variety of choices, all very tasty. Good service.
