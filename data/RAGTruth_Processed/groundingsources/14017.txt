Yesterday I brought my mom out for a birthday cruise on whisper. Kathy was incredibly helpful and accommodating when I made the reservation. This company is full of heart. On the day of the cruise captain Mike had a lot of interesting information to share with us about Santa Barbara and the marine life we spotted while we were out on the water. We even got to see dolphins which was icing on the cake. It was a very special day and I can't thank you all enough. I highly recommend coming out with them on any of their boats."}]}
