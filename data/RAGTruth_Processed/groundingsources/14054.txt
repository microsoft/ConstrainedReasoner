We got the veg thupka  and momos. The thupka had just perfect balance between the noodles and vegetables. The food arrived in a very short time.Definitely recommend to go here."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-27 03:40:06", "review_text": "By looking in from outside as soon as they opened for dinner, I hesitated to go in. It was early and the restaurant was still had only a few customers. I was staying overnight in the area and I was new to the neighborhood. The food was excellent. One of the dishes we ordered along with chicken vindaloo, Aloo Govi, and naan, was Himalayan special chow meon. From the spicy level of 1-10, we chose 7. It was delicious but a bit too spicy for me to fully enjoy although I can proudly say I can handle spicy food. Maybe next time I will choose 5. The food was amazing with cold beer. The price was very reasonable too. By the time we were leaving, the restaurant was packed with customers."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-19 00:27:08", "review_text": "Really flavorful and interesting food. I got the vegetable curry. It was delicious and had a great depth of flavor. It was a bit oily, but not over-the-top. My friend ordered the ming bean noodle dish. It was really good as well, the flavor was a bit more tamed. It had a nice garlicky taste and the vegetables in it were delicious, especially the mushrooms which were perfectly saut\u00e9ed. The pickled vegetables condiment was really nice and reminded me of the super salty pickled lime skin you get with some types of Indian cuisine. Great place - very vegan and vegetarian friendly."}]}
