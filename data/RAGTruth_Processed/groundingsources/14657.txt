The meat and veggies come cooked already in the soup (probably for health reasons and people who haven't had hot pot) which is different from other hot pot experiences, but still a good meal. This location isn't usually busy but the service isn't as attentive when it comes to refilling the broth."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-06-22 20:46:55", "review_text": "Service was good. I ordered lamb pot. The broth was nice and mild. It's not like the typical shabushabu places where the broth is always so salty. You can literately drink the broth here. It's a little pricy, but if you live near Goleta or in IV, it's very convenient. \nRecommend :)"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-06-18 23:24:37", "review_text": "Great flavors that are great on a chilly night. Visiting for graduation weekend, the place was busy and they were short staffed. Very friendly and all were very accommodating."}]}
