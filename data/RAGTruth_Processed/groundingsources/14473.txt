{"question": "what is boron used for", "passages": "passage 1:Boron compounds are also used as fertilizers in agriculture, and in sodium perborate bleaches. In minor uses, boron is an important dopant for semiconductors, and boron-containing reagents are used as intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals.atural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent. In biology, borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods and are used as insecticides.\n\npassage 2:Uses of Boron. 1  Much boron is made into sodium tetraborate which is used to insulate fiberglass. 2  It is also used in many cleaning products-detergents and bleaches. 3  Most boron is used to produce glass and ceramics. It is also used in many cleaning products-detergents and bleaches. 2  Most boron is used to produce glass and ceramics. 3  Borosilicate glass has a fantastic resistance to thermal shock (sudden changes in temperature which causes glass to break).\n\npassage 3:Boron compounds were known and used for thousands of years but the element was first discovered by Jons Jakob Berzelius, in 1824. Before that, it was isolated in the lab by combined efforts of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Louis Jacques Thenard, th\u00e9nard And Sir Humphry. davyoron has been useful to mankind in the form of different compounds. The existence of this element was first discovered by Joens J\u00f6ns Jakob. Berzelius it is known to have wide variety of uses from medical to industrial.
