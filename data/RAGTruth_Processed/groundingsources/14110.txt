I am a rabid sushi fan who eats sushi at least once a week if I can afford it. (Why don't other restaurants offer this amazing Sushiya roll?) I went there so often the entire staff knew me by name. They are so friendly and always ask me about school. Even after graduating, I would still go back. It's a pain to drive in Isla Vista but it is WORTH it for this restaurant. Don't be fooled by the quality of the surrounding Isla Vista restaurants: this place is delicious, high quality, fresh, and fast. I have never been disappointed. It is a truly wonderful family-owned and operated small business with nice indoor & outdoor seating, mere steps from the beach. Don't sleep on this place. It may be in a student area but it is higher quality & more affordable than Sushi Teri etc. I've eaten here more times than I care to count, & will return whenever I'm in the area."}]}
