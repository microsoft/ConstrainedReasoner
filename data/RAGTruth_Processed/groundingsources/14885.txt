This wasn't our first time drinking at the hotel--we've been to the oceanfront bars a couple times, where we feel like we're getting the view/atmosphere/Rosewood experience for the relatively affordable price of two unreasonably expensive, mediocre cocktails. The Manor Bar doesn't come with views of the water, but it is an exceedingly lovely hotel bar and the cocktails are actually good.\n\nWe walked in around 10:00 the night before Thanksgiving, and the place was calm but not empty, which felt ideal. It was beautiful and cozy in a cigars-and-whiskey lounge kind of way, with dark wood paneling, intricate ceiling work, a fireplace, and leather and plush fabric furniture. We sat at the bar, which was very attractive, and ordered a round of drinks from a friendly, formally dressed bartender.\n\nAll the cocktails were named for books--a cute touch--and we got A Game of Thrones and a Catch-22. A Game of Thrones was a scotch drink with Glenmorangie 10 yr, Talisker 10 yr, lemon, citrus oleo saccharum, and egg white. An excellent cocktail, smoky and bright with a nice creamy froth on top. The Catch-22 was balanced and boozy, with Hennessy VSOP, Whistle Pig 10 yr, Dolin Rouge, and Benedictine.\n\nWe noticed a smoking cloche behind the bar and talked to the bartender about what it was used for, apparently a cocktail that wasn't on the current menu (but which he seemed perfectly able and ready to make). Maybe we'll try it next time we're at the Manor Bar. I suspect we'll make the walk over whenever we're in town."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-05 17:39:37", "review_text": "A wonderful wood paneled clubby bar in the Rosewood Miramar this is a nearly perfect spot to enjoy fireside drinks and (at times) music. While we have come for years, I removed one star as the vast collection of dirty glasses on the bar top has somehow become a signature of the space. Also the food menu was better when the resort first opened with Caruso's Rigatoni being a beloved dish. Staff are kind, thoughtful if not all polished."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-09-02 08:36:53", "review_text": "Best bartender super friendly and knowledgeable. I asked for a super complicated cocktail that was on the menu 3 years ago and made it in a jiffy. Love the live music and the vibe. Would come back any day"}]}
