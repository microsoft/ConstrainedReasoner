I'm not sure how I did it & I don't want you to have to go through that so let me tell you why you've got to eat here today, right now..\n\nSkip the lines! This sandwich joint has Yelp 24 set up where you can quickly assemble your order, pay online, & pick up quickly after. \n\nThey have actual veggie filled veggie sandwiches! So often I come across a \"veggie\" burger or sandwich that has lettuce, cheese, bun.. Basically because it lacks meaty goodness it's considered \"veggie.\" Oh no, not here! My super veggie sandwich had flavorfully marinated mushrooms, cucumbers, peppers, pickles, tomatoes, & more! Plus you can customize what veggies you want on off or added; it's never ending veggie madness! \n\nAnd finally, they have M&M cookies! \nBest way to finish a darn good meal is to sweeten your palette with an American favorite, the M&M cookie! \n\n(Just a tip- Even if you do use the splendid Yelp24 take out service.. don't get as excited as I do and eat in the car. These sandwiches are carefully constructed and need full 1 on 1 attention, otherwise your lap will be getting full attention.)"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-10-02 00:50:06", "review_text": "This place is overpriced and expensive.    The  service is terrible and the food is not that good.   They could update the place as well. 12 bucks for a sandwich.  No way.  The owner should take more pride."}]}
