And the first time I tried it was this year. The taste is impeccable. \n\nI came to this location over summer with my friends. We sat down to eat our sandwiches. And the nice older gentleman working the cash register just got me a cup of iced water without me asking for it. He did it out of the kindness of his heart. It was the sweetest thing ever. I will never forget it. He deserves an award. He comes up to me, gives me the water, and says, \"I couldn't let you eat the sandwich without a cup of water.\" Awww so sweet. \n\nI definitely recommend this place. Get the turkey with provolone, Mike's way, and with jalape\u00f1os! Yummy :)"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-01 21:31:50", "review_text": "Good Afternoon,\nI am writing in hope that Ashley Beaty of store # 20075 in Goleta California gets recognized for outstanding customer service.  I called on Monday September 27th to place a large of 25 sandwiches for my son's school.  Ashley was courteous, knowledgeable, and very professional.  She up sold on 25 bags of chips and drinks.  In a world where customer service has deteriorated into nothingness, Ashley Beaty is out there making a difference.  When I arrived on Thursday to pick up my sandwiches, I was met with a great attitude, a well packaged and correct order.  I hope that you properly recognize her for her commitment to your company and to us the customers.\nSincerely,\nPhillip P."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-07-28 00:23:29", "review_text": "This is probably the worst location I've been too. The service no matter what time of day you go is always horrible! Tried giving them another chance but this is the absolute last time I would come here.. need to hire better employees. And to make it worse the air condition is leaking."}]}
