We had the ceviche, albacore tuna melt and ahi tacos. All were very good and we'd get them again! Ordered the bartender special cocktail - good but a little pricey and served in a martini glass so not a lot of cocktail.  All in all, a fun place with decent food."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-10-15 00:23:03", "review_text": "We flew to LAX 1 day before, and drove 2 hours from LA to Santa Barbara which is our trip main itinerary. There are several tents selling merchandise along from parking lot to pier. On the pier, you can get fresh sea urchin, crabs, and spiky lobsters. Lobsters each weighs over 1 lb to almost 2 lbs. You just hand picked and paid by the weight which they accept credit card. Then you proceed to cook station for fee of $5 and waited for about an hour. We also got a plate of paella, a cup of clam chowder for our lunch. Initially wanted to try fresh oysters a dozen for $25 but the line was too long. There's ceviche, taco, street corn, etc. Once we got our food, we settled down near the beach picnic table under palm trees. \n\nAll and all, the experience was great. Enjoyed driving along beach despite the LA traffic."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2019-10-14 01:18:58", "review_text": "Over crowded festival with overpriced food. I was mainly interested in tasting some fresh uni.  There were a couple of venders selling live uni but most of them had hardly any eggs in it.  I paid one for $15 and it was okay but not good enough to get another one.  The live fish and lobsters, after purchasing them, you have to take them to a different tent to cook for you and there was a long line.  I had to wait for 30 minutes for jambalaya shrimp which had four little shrimp and the rest was rice.   And it was too salty. Seafood paella looked good but again there was a long line.  Overall, I was very disappointed.  There was nothing special about this festival.  I can have live lobsters or crab at home anytime for much less price.  \n."}]}
