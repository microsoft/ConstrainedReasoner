I just got a generic vanilla latte to be safe and I loved it. A little sweeter than usual but it's okay. I came around 5:40 so I got my drink made in minutes so it was a quick in and out. Located next to a lot of cute shops too!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 14:13:31", "review_text": "Hustle & Grind is a really unique spot. I can't think of many coffee shops that also sell Hawaiian shaved ice, it's a pretty unique concept and I really liked the variety. The coffee is pretty good, just be careful because it is extremely hot. The service was incredibly fast and the staff was very friendly. There's no indoor seating but there are a handful of tables outside."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-09-21 05:31:30", "review_text": "no almond milk anymore??? not vibes.
