{"question": "difference between struts and shocks", "passages": "passage 1:On Automobiles we loosely use the word 'damper' in place of 'shock'. A Strut is essentially a shock absorber and a spring fitted into one unit. On some cars, the damper (or technically the shock absorber) is seperate from the spring. If the Spring and shock are mounted together as a single unit, it is called a strut. Now to conclude, a damper is any material/device in general that can absorb vibration. A shock absorber is a type of damper known as friction damper. A Strut is a shock (damper) with a spring as one unit. Dampers and shock-absorbers are the same. Both of them perform the same function- to quickly phase out the vibrations from the spring that has absorbed the shocks on road in the form of vibrations.\n\npassage 2:A shock absorber resists the bouncing using hydraulics. That\u2019s all it does. Struts are more complex. They combine shock absorption with steering elements and support for the vehicle. Shocks are more common on trucks and SUVs, while you usually find struts on cars. But sometimes you find both\u2014one in the front and the other in the back. Struts are more expensive, because they are more complex.\n\npassage 3:So, what exactly is the difference between shocks and struts? Shocks and struts are two different suspension parts that perform similar functions on various suspension systems. In strut suspension systems, the spring is held by the strut, and the strut provides structural support for the vehicle. Struts are more common on cars than on trucks and larger vehicles. Shocks, on the other hand, provide no structural support for your vehicle. They are mounted directly to the vehicle\u2019s frame at one end and the lower suspension on the other end. Shocks are most commonly found on trucks, SUVs and vans.\n\n"}
