The pies are delicious, clearly the best around town, and for what they are, appropriately priced.  I am under the impression that the store is currently undergoing some ownership/management changes, which may make large event planning go a bit smoother.  Despite extraordinarily friendly service, over the course of the last many months of wedding planning, Simply Pies was at times unorganized and difficult to reach.  Overall, we would have appreciated more guidance.  That being said, don't get me wrong, I would use them again because 1) Pies are better than cake, 2) Simply Pies are better than other pies."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-07-02 04:42:31", "review_text": "Love the quiche, and the candied pecans  Great local businesses with excellent service and high quality offerings!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-05-10 00:48:38", "review_text": "Just bought berry and apple pies, 2 beef, 2 chicken and 2 veggie pies and ohhhh my god this is heaven on earth!
