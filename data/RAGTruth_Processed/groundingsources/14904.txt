I know they were hit with a lot of people when they opened but they still made our drinks delicious and hot, and handled customer questions and swaps so professionally. It's hard enough to work during this pandemic, and having red cup day only adds to the pressure. I wish I caught their names because they were great! Happy holidays, ladies!"}]}
