They have a huge sandbox and lots of room to run around. We held our son's birthday party here and it was wonderful. Parents can kick back with a beer and relax. This is good for meeting up with other parents too.\n\nThey recently re-opened and remodeled. The place looks nice. They have a new patio area, a pond, and the interior was remodeled.\n\nWhat is unfortunate, however, is that the quality of the food went down.\n\nThe old place (maybe different owners?) had better-than-regular grilled food as well as salads and Pizza Mizza pizza. The new menu is just grilled stuff with a few salads and apps. But it tasted terrible - multiple people agreed.\n\nOf course people will still come here because it is a place that you can hang for hours with your kids while eating and drinking, but whereas I used to enjoy the food too, now I'm not so sure that I'll be ordering.\n\nBeware that parking is sparse."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2010-09-22 05:57:01", "review_text": "Most kid friendly restaurant I've ever been to. Shrieking, restless, jumping up and down, teasing kids, no problems with a stop along 101 here. Don't know why they don't have more of these in California. Sure beats McDonalds. When the weather cooperates, which is more often than not, this is an ideal casual spot to dine at. \n\nAs far the Chinese Chicken Salads we ordered, we agreed the dressing was not the best we ever tasted, though the chopped Romaine lettuce was frankly fresh. I asked if they could substitute the Black Bean burger for the chicken. They not only complied happily, they char broiled the Black Bean Burger to luscious goodness, awesome. I was impressed. They didn't bat an eye when I asked for that, which was way cool. \n\nWe enjoyed hearing and watching the trains choo choo chooing on by.  As a height challenged person, I had to stand up in order to see the ocean waves roll in. When I sat down I had only a hedge, green lawn and sand pit view. Still, I would come here again. While we ate, we were serenaded by ocean waves crashing up to the shore. \n\nTook a beach walk, which is a hop and a skip away. Saw plenty of dolphins, in fact, several times. Advice: Bring binoculars if you have them."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2010-08-28 07:26:47", "review_text": "Very glad to read the so-so reviews. I was afraid I was becoming a killjoy.\n\nThe lawn is beautiful, very relaxing. But the food took the shine off the scenery. Tri-tip sandwich was tough, the Pepperoni pizza ought to be renamed the mushroom immersion as it would be impossible to be more mushroomy unless you were eating your way out of a mushroom from the inside. \n\nThe fries are very good!\n\nMy suggestion, buy a meal from another place nearby then add a soda and fries here, enjoy the scenery and smile knowing that you're eating the best meal on the property."}]}
