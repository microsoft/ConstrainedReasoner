There are a fair number of high-star reviews here, and I don't generally like to post low-star reviews. But let me outline the reasons why I am:\n\n- Despite the shop's own employees acknowledging that they should have vegan options in their sweet baked goods and/or ice cream, they don't. There are a lot of vegans in this area and it just makes sense to offer vegan options, both for environmental and capitalist reasons (you'd sell many vegan cookies, I promise)\n- While one server was friendly, the other staff member seemed absolutely bored and lackadaisical (adjective: lacking enthusiasm and determination; carelessly)\n- My Americano tasted much more watery than an Americano is meant to (it's my drink of choice and while my experience does not account for a thorough sampling of all Americanos in existence, I do feel qualified to make this judgment)\n- The cup it was served in had a few spots where a dried unknown substance clung to its outer lip (but hey, at least you do ceramic reusable mugs)\n- Despite shaking the jug of oatmilk on the counter which I decided to add to my Americano to try and improve the drink, what came out was a watered-down stream of almost clear liquid. As I mentioned, I shook the jug, so this wasn't just due to the natural sedimentation of plant milks\n- I had contacted your shop via Facebook before I ever visited to ask about catering an event, and never received a reply--even though this is at present their only mode of contact aside from walking in\n\nSadly, this earns two stars. IV Drip, you can do better."}]}
