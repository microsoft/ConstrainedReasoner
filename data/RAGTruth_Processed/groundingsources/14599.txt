Still mediocre food at above average prices. There's so many better places to visit that Las Brasas falls low on the list. \n \nSame owner, same layout with room for 38. The same, less than clean restaurant with dirty table cloths at salsa bar (empty bins in the bar but not sure what usually goes there). The floors were not clean and our table had some evidence of the previous quests. Yuck. \n\nOrdered the Torta Cabana for $7.99 after observing 3 others eating it. Meh. The chicken was way over fried, the thin bun fell apart but the avocado seemed fresh. There are certainly better tortas in town.\nThe Shrimp burrito, well, where's the shrimp? Hard to find in all the fillers. The sauce is good though. \n\nSpeaking of salsa.\nThe green salsa is more crisp then creamy and has a high, long burn.\nTable salsa is mellow with a little chunk but no kick. Perfect those who can't handle the burn. \nThe roasted salsa has potential if the heat was kicked up a notch. The smoke is there.\n\nWhat can I say that I've not already said? It's not worth your visit."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-07-04 13:41:21", "review_text": "My wife and I stopped here just looking for some tacos on our way up to Pismo. We ordered the street taco plate with carne asada and the baja tacos (one shrimp and one fish) with a delicious mango salsa topping.. We were amazed! The carne asada was moist and perfectly seasoned. The fish was incredibly fresh and cooked just right. The shrimp taco was excellent. Great salsa bar, and if you like spicy like me, it does not disappoint.  My mother-in-law is from Mexico and an excellent cook. These dishes are authentic and tasty. Of course, we stopped on the way back 5 days later. They were the two best meals on our trip by far!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2015-06-07 23:18:42", "review_text": "I went here today with my girlfriend, and we both loved it! Best Mexican food either of us have had in the area. GREAT friendly service, good prices, and great food. I had a carnitas burrito, and it was HUGE. Always a plus. The carnitas were amazing, the burrito was loaded with goodness (read: guac), and it came with a side salad, which was unexpected but nice. My girlfriend got chicken sopes, which were also to die for. The chicken was amazing, and the plating was beautiful. The salsa bar was the icing on the cake. It was awesome. Definitely give this place a try. Cannot comment on the seafood problems some users had, but the non-seafood items we got were fantastic."}]}
