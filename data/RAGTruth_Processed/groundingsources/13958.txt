Coast Guard Vet and Wife Convicted in Identity Theft Case by Jury
A jury in Hawaii found a married couple guilty of conspiracy, passport fraud, and identity theft for using the names of deceased infants for decades.
According to the court documents, the jury deliberated for roughly two hours before returning guilty verdicts on Monday.
Bobby Fort and Julie Montague were the names used by the presiding judge in their trial in U.S. District Court in Honolulu. In court, the pair claimed that no one was harmed by their conduct.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Muehleck testified at trial's outset that the "real" Bobby Fort had been dead for over 50 years. The baby had "a bad cough" and lived 3 months, Muehleck claimed.
Tonda Montague Ferguson, one of the witnesses, said that her mother had her sister, Julie Montague, in 1968, while she was in the eighth grade. However, Ferguson claimed, the baby was born with deformities and passed away around three weeks later.
Muehleck said the two graves where the infants were laid to rest were located 15 miles (24 kilometers) apart in Texas.
Prosecutors say the couple's real identities are Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison.
They went to the same high school in Texas, and Muehleck says a friend who kept in touch with them afterward recalls that they stayed with him for a while and stated they planned to change their identities because of significant debt.
The prosecutor said that the spouse had joined the Coast Guard under a false identity that made him appear to be 12 years younger.
When they're sentenced in March, they face maximum 10-year prison terms for counts of making false statements in the application and use of a passport. Both accusations, conspiracy and aggravated identity theft, carry mandatory consecutive two-year sentences.
After their arrests in December of last year, authorities hinted that the case involved more than just identity theft, and it quickly received widespread media attention. Polaroids of the couple wearing what appear to be actual KGB jackets were introduced early on by the prosecution. The couple's attorneys said they donned the matching jackets on a lark, and prosecutors eventually dropped all spying charges.
