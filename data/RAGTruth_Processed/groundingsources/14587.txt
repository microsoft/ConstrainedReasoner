Didn't get the avocado. Ordered a side salad and they brought the wrong dressing for both me and another colleague. The BLT was expensive and came as is. No side. Salad was an extra 2 bucks. \n\nThe new salad bar is great but one big problem...there's barely any protein to top your salad. There's absolutely no meat at all. So if you're vegetarian it would be great. \n\nFor what I got I felt like it was overpriced. You can go down the street to the deli and have a really big sandwich with a side for cheaper than I paid here. Needless to say, I will not be coming back."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-03-26 19:56:06", "review_text": "Was a bit disappointed that they offer NO SUBSTITUTIONS. I asked for roast beef and turkey on the same sandwich. It wasn't on their menu so they said no. Then I asked for turkey and bacon They told me no they had turkey and avocado on their menu. They were not willing to vary from their menu at all. I ended up next door at Panino and had a great sandwich."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2016-03-11 23:01:38", "review_text": "Came here for breakfast/brunch with friends. They have a wide variety of foods to choose from, so there's probably something for everyone.\n\nI love the Papas Santa Barbara!! The potatoes are nice and crispy, and topped with cheese, avocado, tomato, and chicken bits you can't go wrong. But I think it could've used more salsa or something, and it's a little expensive considering it's mostly potatoes but that's how breakfast foods are typically.\n\nTheir shaved snow dessert was decent! I tried the oriental flavor that has this soybean powder stuff on top (kinako in Japanese) that's so bomb!! I love kinako so it was cool to find a place around SB that uses it. It also has crunchy little cereal bits that add nice texture.\n\nMy friend got the bulgogi burrito I think. They flavor was okay, but it wasn't very impressive to me and I personally wouldn't order it again.\n\nThe workers were really nice! Half of my group got backyard bowls but they still let us all sit inside the restaurant :)"}]}
