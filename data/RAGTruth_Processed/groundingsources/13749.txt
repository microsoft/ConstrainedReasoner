We didn't jave a reservation, but were early enough we were able to get seated right away.  Adam was our server & he was outstanding!  He was friendly, funny, cute & he offered great menu suggestions!  The American Mule cocktails were very tasty!  The ckicken picatta was delicious as well as my garlic mashed potatoes.   The sauted spinach was a bit bland, though.  A member of my party had the seard Ahi tuna & said it was good.  Her side salad was fresh, but lacked any personality.  Another person had the crunch burger & raved about it.  The english muffin bun is really good!   Another person had the pasta primavera & it was \"okay\".  We all shared the apple pie alamode dessert & it was gone in a nanosecond.  Quite a feat for 4 people who said they were all stuffed!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2018-01-15 22:49:14", "review_text": "Always loved their stroganoff.

Had them last week with the great HH drinks served by Marcos to wife and to me.  On the  clams--huge amount of clams and pastq, well seasoned, not oily.  (I requested no extra salt.)  We also enjoy the skins and meatloaf dinner (best value in town)."}]}
