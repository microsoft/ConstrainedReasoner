Seating is available both inside and out. My bacon avocado cheese omelet was very good. The fresh mellon berry cup I asked for on the side was so full of fresh fruit flavor. The toasted sour dough bread was wonderfully crusty and lightly buttered, however it came to me cold. \nMy companion asked for the salsa verde with his meal. Be careful. It's very picante!\nApple Pay is taken. I used the restroom and found the toilet actively leaking. Apparently, it's an ongoing issue.  \nAll in all, there were a few issues, but no deal breakers here. Enjoy!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-06 18:53:25", "review_text": "Everyone enjoyed brunch.  Sons had the pancake special. Wife had the mash substituted sausage for ground beef.  And I had tuna melt with grilled onions.   Next time we are in Santa Barbara we will return"}]}
