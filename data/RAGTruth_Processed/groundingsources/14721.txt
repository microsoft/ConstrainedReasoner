My problem is that this cafe exemplifies a trend that makes me *livid*; businesses who adopt the minimalist/rustic/modern hippie aesthetic by using \"humble\"materials and re-claimed wood, trendy branding and hiring some lightly tattooed staff. Yes, it all looks good. But it's utter BULLSHIT if the business doesn't actual care about the issues people who started these trends care about.\nMaybe dial back the effort on \"branding and interior design\" and look into \"sustainability and climate change\". By the way, I'm not mad at super chic establishments who look gorgeous but  back it up with action. Cafe Gratitude is obnoxiously on-trend/good-looking/pricey - but they walk the walk."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-07-23 03:34:35", "review_text": "Such a cute coffee place! Staff was super friendly and tons of snacks available also. Although we did not have time for lunch, the food looked delicious as well.

If there was an option for negative stars that's what they would've received from me. The service just sucks. Kylie C. Needs a lesson in customer service. I stood at the counter for 10 minutes to get more coffee just for her to ignore me and help other people. When I was finally helped the attitude was crap. I'd say you would be better off going to Starbucks, or better yet go to McDonalds, either place would at least give you better service and is way cheaper."}]}
