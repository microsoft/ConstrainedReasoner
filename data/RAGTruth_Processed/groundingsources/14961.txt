Everything was as standard as I expected it to be, so it neither disappointed nor surprised me. \n\nService: Very friendly. My family and I were seated immediately. Props to the one waiter who came around and re-filled my water 3 times. Our plates were also regularly collected, so they didn't accumulate on top of our table. \n\nFood: This wasn't a full-out buffet. It was about two rows of food, but it had all of the standard options: chow mein, fried rice, steamed white rice, assorted vegetables, salad, fried chicken, kung pao chicken (or pork? I forgot which of the two it was), potstickers, cream cheese wontons, egg drop soup, soft serve vanilla ice cream, etc. \nMy family & I were the first customers of the day, so we were the first ones to hit up the buffet. I don't know if that fact affects this review, but from what I saw, everything was pretty fresh. However, in terms of taste, nothing really stood out. \n\nI left with a full stomach, and for its price, the lunch buffet was fitting."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2017-04-25 06:20:26", "review_text": "The buffet was terrible. Very small selection and the food did not taste good! The buffet was expensive! $55.00 for 3 dinner buffets!Will not go back!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2017-04-01 07:16:05", "review_text": "Came to SB for a show and wanted Chinese food after. Came here for the buffet and it was okay. The shrimp was overly salty. The customer service was great, but the food was not the best. For the price its not bad, but i feel it could be better. Probably will not come back."}]}
