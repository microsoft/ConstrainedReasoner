Updating review to 5* based on my kids (and my experience). \"wow dad you gotta rate this place 5 stars on Yelp!\" She was right. From the helpful staff constantly helping me out as a rookie chef, to the tasty ingredients and plentiful quantities. We really had a good time out as a family. It is definitely a good place to take the kids when one parent has to work. Kids are not too pricey (age+$3), so with just one adult it wasn't too pricey. Plus the kids had a blast choosing and then cooking their own food. My favorite was the brisket and pork belly, both cooked just to be slightly crispy. So good!  I do have to figure out how to be a better cook, I think I was just impatient and was asking them to turn the fire too high to cook faster but then it would burn the leftover after I was done cooking and smoked. The staff came over a few times and swap out the grill and turn the down. Anyway it was great food and good fun, and as my daughter said definitely 5*... We'll be back the next time mom has to work late :)"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-06 02:53:37", "review_text": "This is overall an experience for those carnivores out there! Go in with an appetite and hungry. The group tried different cuts of meats from the menu and there are sides such as kimchi, seaweed salad, corn and cucumber just to name a few. Rice and salad is available upon request. They have limited beers on the menu and some wines. The brisket, wagu steak and pork belly are the top three to get. They have some seafood selection such as octopus and shrimp. The meat is perfectly seasoned and you can adjust salt to your liking. You have control to cook and sear the meat to your liking. The service is overall friendly and ensure that you have what is needed and extremely attentive. Come here with an appetite and a carnivorous experience."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-05 00:36:01", "review_text": "I have been wanting to try this place out since it's always PACKED with a line out the door. I saw they do some take-out options so we ordered spicy sweet chicken (has some good heat), marinated short ribs (has a sweet flavor), and pork belly kimchi fried rice (very large portion!). Each meat dish comes with white rice, kimchi, and cucumber. We had plenty of food for two of us and probably enough for a second meal. Phone ordering and pick-up was very easy! I hope to go try it out in-person someday!"}]}
