Rustic little stop, seating on front deck, or out back nestled in the trees.  Both have live music usually!  Not a rock band, but one guy, one guitar, one voice.  So enjoyable for 20 minutes, or the entire afternoon!\n\nTwo words: Tritip Chili.  So good.  Even if all you do is stop for a couple of containers of the stuff (don't forget onions and cheese) and take them home.  You won't regret it.  Used to do that on the way home EVERY camping trip we made to Rancho Oso.  But don't be fooled, this place may have the best burger in SB County.  EVERYTHING on the menu is fantastic...and even a little better due to ambiance.\n\nDon't sell yourself short.  Stop here at the Paradise Store."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2015-12-01 21:08:21", "review_text": "Nice people. Did not try the food.the rating is for the 10$ they charged for a very small box of firewood."}]}
