There were no sides and no variety of appetizers. After reading the reviews of the food I was sad to see the menu look so bare and lonely. \nOur server was great, very friendly and the Sommelier was excellent. I chose the mushrooms, the lobster pasta and chocolate mousse. The mushrooms were hearty but the lobster pasta only had about 5 small pieces of lobster. My husband ordered the Ceasar salad, salmon and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. He enjoyed his salad but the salmon filet was small.  With 3 (possibly small) \n items per person, you may want to grab an appetizer in the lobby bar before you come. \nIt also took forever to get each course. We were seated at 6:55pm and didn't leave until 9:25pm. My husband and son went back to the room while I waited at the table an additional 15 minutes for 2 cookies and a side of vanilla ice cream. I asked a manager who walked by to check on the dessert and to get me a copy of the itemized receipt. He seemed annoyed. Overall, maybe I'll return when the regular menu is back.."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-22 22:11:03", "review_text": "First off, I want to say all of the staff were amazing but we loved our server Autumn. She was so sweet and really knew the menu. We ordered everything she recommended. \n\nWe got a bottle of wine to start, very crisp and light. Then for appetizers we ordered a dozen oysters which came in fresh from Baja, CA. I love that they provided a large amount of lemon, hot sauce and this amazing house made sauce. I could have eaten 100. One of the best selection of oysters we had. The quail and side salad was phenomenal. Just watch out for the little bones.\n\nFor dinner, I got the halibut which was so rich and tender I could barely scoop it up. It was very flavorful. Bae got the filet and potatoes which was cooked to perfection. We got a side of the cauliflower and it was the perfect side. \n\nWe opted for the chocolate mousse cake since chocolate is my favorite but to be honest wouldn't recommend. I wish they would expand their dessert menu but overall great night sitting by the water!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-10 20:06:30", "review_text": "Had a great time! Good service, drinks and food. Very knowledgeable. The filet mignon was amazing and finally found a place with a good bearnaise. Lots of tarragon and saffron on the menu. Would be 5 stars with a smidge lower price tag. The lighting was a little \"shoe storey\" but maybe because we were seated in the middle of the room. We also got wine recs starting close to $300. Apart from that a great experience."}]}
