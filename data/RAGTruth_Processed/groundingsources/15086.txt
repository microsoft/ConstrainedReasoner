Spent $108 for eight of us and had to pay $.50 for a coffee refill.  I understand this is a good policy to control folks hanging around too long and just ordering coffee, but employees must be flexible to the better customers. Ordered the Cafe Classic Breakfast for myself and it was good."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-05-07 22:07:02", "review_text": "First time here and the chocolate chocolate cupcake was like heaven.

The taste of the cake is also hit or miss. I still really like the environment here though as a spot in IV because it has a large seating area and a bar."}]}
