I Ordered a salad with rotisserie chicken today. The Salad was very plain and very frail looking. The portion of chicken was one small Chunk of less than a quarter of a breast.   This was a take out order."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 07:22:51", "review_text": "So happy we ended up here on a cold, rainy December day where you either stay in hotel or see if you can find Oprah's Montecito compound. The hostess was super sweet and took my number to call once somebody, anybody left their seat. It was a perfect cozy place to linger on such a day. My husband and I dined here with our 5 year old son. The duo of dips was a fantastic warm up - a pimento style cheese dip coupled with guacamole and WARM chips. Nice touch on the kitchen drawer warmers. The real star of the show is Dings Chicken sandwich.  We decided we'd be happy to have it a few times a week for... forever.  The cocktails are good, pricey like everywhere you want to hang out and be served. Bees Knees and Marg are winners. Only negative comment: The marg with campari and mint should be replaced.  It was like drinking grapefruit juice after brushing your teeth. Luckily our server happily replaced it. I look forward to going here again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-27 00:59:21", "review_text": "Wow ! Service 5 star class acts from the Hostess to Waitress to Manager all treated us as if we were only family dining, Food- I think my entire family all were in agreement Chicken Sandwich was absolutely the best most delicious sandwich we have ever had. Every bite was so fantastic filled with flavor. We will definitely be returning for that Chicken Sandwich!!"}]}
