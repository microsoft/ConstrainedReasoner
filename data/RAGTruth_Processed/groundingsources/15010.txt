Not only are the hotdogs/sausages great but their burgers are surprisingly the cheapest and most delicious in town!

I'd always go for hotdog, sourkraut and mustard, simple and delicious. \n\nWhat really sets this place a part from your average hot-dog joint are the dogtown fries.  Think of them as Nacho fries.  They are so amazing.  The fries are loaded with beans, guacamole, onions, jalapenos, grated cheese, & bacon bits.  \n\nThese alone give them 4/5 stars. The missing star is the price (but really, what isn't over priced in Isla Vista) and for being a hot dog place, I really wish the hot dogs were amazing instead of okay."}]}
