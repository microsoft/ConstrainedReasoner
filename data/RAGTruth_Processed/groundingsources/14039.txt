The food came pretty quickly but unfortunately for me it wreaked havoc on my stomach. Within one hour of finishing my food I found myself sitting on a public toilet in downtown Santa Blahblah between a movie theater and a Marshells. The porcelain toilet shone in the way that only a toilet used by countless homeless men, as not only a receptacle for their excrement but also a handy place to nap, could shine. That being said when I left that not so holy of throne rooms it was stained with with the dark blood of man who hasn't been comfortable on a toilet for far too long."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-05-18 17:26:02", "review_text": "My fiancee and I frequented Killer B's at their State street location, and I would have given it a 3.5 star at that time.  It was always so-so. A good place to grab a quick drink, or a quick bite when you want something quick and easy, nothing fancy.  The servers were always rather annoying and not very friendly or quick, and they always spent more time talking to each other than to their tables. \n\nWe finally decided to try out the new Killer B location with the intent of using our Axxess card there, and we left without even ordering food.  \n\nWe sat at a table inside, and was greeted by the bartender who was EXTREMELY rude and unfriendly.  He literally walked away from me mid sentence. He tried everything possible to avoid eye contact, and he had absolutely not hustle in his step. That however wasn't even the last straw.  We went ahead and ordered two drinks, a beer for me and a cosmopolitan for the lady. the cosmo was GROSS! I honestly think that he forgot to put he alcohol in the drink.  It was watered down and tasteless.  \n\nBad service, bad drinks... we decided not to continue and order what we can only assume would be bad food. \n\nWill never be returning here by my own decision.  Too many other good restaurants to waste time on this place.  We walked over the Santa Barbara Brew and enjoyed a delicious dinner and drinks that actually had alcohol in them."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-05-10 21:37:39", "review_text": "Such a shame!\n\nThis review is not based on the food at this establishment, rather on the lack of service and attention.\n\nI was in Santa Barbara for the day on the weekend of Cinco de Mayo. It was a Sunday around 2pm and I had been looking for a place to eat when I searched for a BBQ joint nearby.\n\nWhen I got to the place I walked into the courtyard where a band was setting up and a few people were gathered.\n\nAs I walked into the place there was a sign that read something like please wait to be seated.\n\nThe girl behind the bar was talking with some other girl and when I asked whether I could sit anywhere there was no response, not even a glance.\n\nThe possible owner of the place (An older leathery looking fellow) walked in and ushered a server outside to do something and again, no attention to the new walk in what so ever.\n\nFinally I asked the guy behind the line what's going on and he finally told me that they are offering a Cinco de Mayo menu and no BBQ in sight.\n\nSo... this place get a 1 star from me and a promise that I will NEVER come back again!\n\nWhen I worked in the restaurant business back in NYC there was NO SUCH THING as letting a walk in just stand there unattended within 30 seconds or less. At least acknowledge the person and let them feel like you gave a S!\n\nI had high hopes for this place... alas!"}]}
