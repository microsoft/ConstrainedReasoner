Got a turkey burger with avocado and a little bit of bacon. Sooooo good! The bun was toasted to perfection. The people working there are always super kind and proactive.

There are options for kids and any adult with some healthy choices to go with it. I stick to the charburger with cheese or the steak sandwich, can't really be disappointed. There is also a kids meal that includes a great apple juice and fries for those kids who just have to have them! No matter what get the tempura green beans and onion rings; heck, you could skip the burgers and just have those!!! Easy parking and a buzzer if you want to wait in car with the kids."}]}
