We had 10 guests for an intimate gathering. We are a group of girls who love to eat! That being said, having them cater this party was something special! Benjamin was very interactive with us, you can tell right away his passion for paella and how it's been apart of his life since he was a kid! \n\nNot only did we enjoy watching, but the paella tasted amazing! Very authentic, bursting with layers of flavor and we had plenty of enough food to go around. \n\nSuch a special experience to bring everyone together to the dinner table to enjoy their paella."}]}
