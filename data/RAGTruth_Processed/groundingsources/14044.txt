The lowest quality eggs were used and they were not prepared as ordered. Cost of breakfast for three with a 15 percent gratuity averaged $28.00 per person. Paper napkins were too small to be usable and we had to ask for extra napkins twice before we got them.  Esau's used to be cheap and good and it's now ridiculously expensive. Hurts to say it, but my old hometown favorite breakfast spot is pretty awful.  The food is ridiculously expensive and poorly prepared and the staff couldn't care less. Avoid this place if possible."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-05 06:24:26", "review_text": "Service was great, quickly received cafe quality coffee.  Cup was kept full throughout the meal which is a big plus for us.  Staff all came across as friendly as well as very diligent in providing good service.\n\nSome good vegetarian options including Tofu 'scramble', basically tofu mixed with lots of vegetables served with feta cheese and salsa topping (actually pico de gallo, but I could not tell you the difference).  Really good, nice to have a breakfast option that did not include eggs.  Hash browns were perfectly cooked.  Partner had Spanish Omelet which was also enjoyed.\n\nOutdoor seating with well spaced tables.  Surprisingly (to us anyway), the indoor seating was completely packed when we left with outdoor seating still available.\n\nIt would have been nice to have plant based \"sausage\" options to complete what was already a very, very good vegetarian meal."}]}
