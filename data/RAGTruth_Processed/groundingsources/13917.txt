JetBlue Cuts 14 Routes from Major Hubs
JetBlue enthusiasts should be aware of the new flight schedule changes, particularly in the Northeast region. Starting in January and continuing into March, JetBlue is cutting 14 routes from its service. The most affected cities are New York and Boston, with the majority of the discontinued routes involving John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports, as well as Boston Logan International Airport. Los Angeles International Airport is also impacted.
The decision to cut these routes is influenced by two factors. Firstly, the dissolution of the Northeast Alliance with American Airlines, which was established in 2021. Secondly, ongoing ATC (Air Traffic Control) staffing challenges faced by the government.
The cancellation of these routes affects several popular destinations including Burlington, Miami, Nashville, and Washington DC, among others. Passengers who are booked on these routes for 2024 need not worry as JetBlue will provide alternative flights or offer refunds.
Here is the full list of canceled routes:
- Boston Logan International Airport–Newark Liberty International Airport
