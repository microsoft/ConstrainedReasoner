The kale was really, really tough, to the point where it wasn't worth finishing. \n\nThe service was okay, but the employee cocktail hour happening behind us while we were the only ones there eating was annoying."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-07-08 03:52:31", "review_text": "Apero has one of the best cocktails lists around in downtown SB and the bartenders are incredibly friendly! The bar itself isn't too big but it makes a cozy spot to interact with strangers and to make new friends. \n\nI recommend the cantaloupe cocktail - they make it with their housemade cantaloupe puree and it's freaking amazing."}]}
