No no- there's much more to come outta these comedians. I have a feeling this particular one may linger instead of being lost into the wind. Will I wait 1-2 for a bang burger? Does a fish swim? Ill wait as long as I can possibly wait just to chance to be a spectator to watching these guys pound their meat. Yes please.\nTry there homemade Ketchup one of these guys made himself...awesome as. Well done guys! When will the C.Stain Ketchup be available in stores? My dang old lady drank the whole bottle. What's the secret ingredient? It's so familiar, I just can't put my dang finger on it. Salty yet creamy- yum! Who would a thunk it?"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-05-16 21:18:26", "review_text": "40 min wait after ordering and paying.  Which is frustrating because if the kitchen is that busy you owe it to customers to tell them.   \n\nWe went when they were a pop up at cork tree cellar.   You can sit anywhere inside or outside.\n\nPrices are fair.   $13 for a double burger and fries combo.   $14 for a veggie burger  combo(better than the meat).\n\nBut after waiting all that time the burger and fries were just alright.  Nothing special at all.   Think In-n-out quality with dramatically worse fries.\n\nThe fries were what was most frustrating, as they had just brought the food out, no reason for them to be luke-warm and limp.  I would have sent them back but at that point, after 40 minutes of waiiting, we just wanted to finish up.\n\nIt would be one star probably except for the cookie.  Small but well worth the $2 indulgence at the end."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-05-02 05:04:57", "review_text": "Awesome food, friendly service!\n\nSmashburgers have become something of a trend over the past year or two - and I'm all about them. The unique way they are prepared with their crispy outer \"crust\" make them quite the delicacy. One issue, though - you just can't find them in greater Santa Barbara! ...or so I thought. \n\nI was happy to hear about Dang Burger. They are essentially a pop-up but I believe can graduate to a storefront with just how popular they've gotten. I first saw them about a few months ago on a friend's Instagram story and wow, did those burgers look delicious. I decided to follow their social media just to see where they'd be popping up. \n\nI have ordered from Dang three times in total (they were at Old Town Coffee tonight!). I believe they are headquartered in Carp and share a space with a wine tasting room. \n\nI order the same thing each time - the Dang Burger combo which I'm assuming is their flagship. Once I find an item I enjoy, it's hard to veer away and this is the current dilemma I'm facing. What a first world problem! The burger is consistently tasty with its crispy thin patty and soft bun. It's the perfect size - and the fries are the ideal complement. \n\nSupport small and local! I look forward to coming back real soon."}]}
