The workers rarely wear masks and regularly allow customers to enter without masks. The shield at the counter is great but not enough. Shocked this no mask behavior has been accepted by the city for so many months despite the state mandate and posted signage upon entering the harbor area that masks are required."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-07-15 20:28:45", "review_text": "They don't wear masks or enforce them.
