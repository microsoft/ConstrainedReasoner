Kids are riding around indoors on electric scooters. Staff are unfriendly and unresponsive. Service is slow. \n\nThey must be really underpaid or something because it really seems like no one cares at all here. \n\nBest part of my visit today was find a finger nail in my salad. I'm a dude, it's a a chick's finger nail. Did they seriously not wear gloves when servicing the salad bar or something? People are probably chewing their finger nails while making my food. Disgusting."}]}
