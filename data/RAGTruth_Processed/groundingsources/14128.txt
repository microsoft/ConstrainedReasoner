My budget was extremely tight (as in I could only afford to cook at home) so considered this place an occasional treat of sorts. You get a lot of bang for the buck. \n\nThis location is just off the freeway but you likely won't see it unless you're traveling north on Fairview. It is in a very small strip mall with only a few parking spaces but I've never had an issue finding a spot. As is the case with other Little Caesar's locations, the venue is confined to a small waiting room with a partially open kitchen. One can typically find pre-made pizzas at the ready - or wait 5-10 minutes as they make your order on the spot. \n\nThe food here won't be mind-blowing but is a pretty good deal for the price paid. You can walk out with a substantial pizza and drink for under $10, enough to feed 3-4. Their menu tends to rotate gently with various limited-time items on special. Service is typically on the subpar side but the interaction is really no more than placing your order and waiting. \n\nLook no further if you are on a time crunch and in the market for a cheap, hot pizza."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-03-29 21:43:19", "review_text": "OK so last two times I ate here were several years apart. The first time I had violent stomach cramps the next morning, and the second wasn't as bad but my stomach still hurt after. Do not go; I do not know the experiences of others but I'm never eating at this chain again."}]}
