I ordered chicken phad thai and while the noodles were pretty i okay the chicken was AWFUL. it had a very fishy taste and smell which should never happen since it is CHICKEN. I also got the shrimp egg rolls which were very bitter and had a fishy aftertaste like the shrimp was old. After only a few bites my stomach hurt. I will never order from here again"}]}
