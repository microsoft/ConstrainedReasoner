Remaining charge against Fort Cavazos colonel dropped by Army
The Army's III Armored Corps recently dropped sexual assault accusations against a colonel. A thorough inquiry led to this judgment.
Col. Jon Meredith, former commander of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Cavazos, Texas, was charged recently. This follows his October 2022 dismissal.
Recently, Army Times got Meredith's charge sheet for violating UCMJ Articles 120 and 133. These articles cover abusive sexual contact and officer misconduct. Meredith faces major charges for Fort Cavazos actions.
Meredith's abusive sexual contact allegation was dropped by III Corps commander Lt. Gen. Sean Bernabe. The case took a major turn last month with this decision. The charge of police misconduct was dropped recently.
The III Armored Corps Commanding General has dropped criminal charges against Col. Jon Meredith. III Corps spokesperson Brian H. Harris told Military Times that new evidence prompted this decision. A decision was made after extensive planning by the Office of the Special Trial Counsel. A commander recently reached a decision after carefully evaluating numerous aspects that determine the appropriate course of action when dealing with misconduct claims. A comprehensive review of numerous factors ensured a fair and suitable reaction to the issue.
Recently, it was discovered that convincing evidence from an Army Criminal probe Division probe spurred the decision to act. Harris elaborated on this revelation.
The Meredith court-martial prosecution was unaware of critical evidence, a surprise turn of events. According to an anonymous source, the prosecution was unaware that this evidence contained relevant information. Many doubt the prosecution's thoroughness and competency after the revelation. How did such critical evidence go unnoticed? This oversight casts doubt on the court-martial's handling and outcome. The insider, who requested anonymity, said this evidence surprised the prosecution. How and why the evidence was ignored is unknown.
Meredith's attorney, Sherilyn A. Bunn, revealed a key defense finding. Bunn told Task & Purpose that the purported victim and her husband exchanged text messages, suggesting a plot to manufacture the assault accusation. The husband's discontent with Meredith's officer evaluation report may have prompted this scheme.
Harris recently stated that Meredith's disciplinary procedures will continue in effect notwithstanding the dismissal of criminal charges.
Harris, the case spokeswoman, stated that the newly discovered evidence is unrelated to the investigation into Col. Meredith's officer misconduct. Recent reports indicate that Col. Meredith will not be court-martialed for his alleged officer misconduct. However, substantial evidence warrants the Commanding General to take appropriate administrative measures in response to the claimed misbehavior.
