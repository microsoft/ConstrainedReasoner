The shawarma Sandwich taste sooo good and the hummus is the best. Alo the fried chicken was something else. Crispy and Halal. The staff are so friendly and the vibes are super. Will definitely come back. This place is super awesome."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-24 15:02:14", "review_text": "We were excited to try this place out, but we're extremely disappointed. The service was slow, it seemed like there were only two people working. The silverware was not very clean. The ambiance was awkward, very quiet, like a doctors office lobby. The beef schwarma sandwich was not good at all. The meat had no flavor, couldn't taste any seasonings. It was also wrapped in a tortilla. A tortilla??! While the menu says \"flat bread.\" I was hoping that at least the baklava would be good, but it was so dry. The hummus that came with the schwarma wasn't that great, either. The Turkish coffee was decent though. Would not recommend and will not come back. 1 star for being ambitious enough to open a new restaurant in town."}]}
