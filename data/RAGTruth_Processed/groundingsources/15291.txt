{"question": "how to get chicken completely done when frying", "passages": "passage 1:This is because the chicken we eat today are young and have under developed bone structure. When the chick is frozen, the blood seeps into the bone and forms ice crystals, only to be released when heated. I was taught in school to buy fresh, never frozen chicken to alleviate this problem, or cook it longer.\n\npassage 2:Heat the shortening in a large, cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. In a brown paper lunch bag, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Shake two chicken pieces in the bag to coat, and place them in the skillet. Repeat until all of the chicken is coated and in the skillet. Fry the chicken over medium-high heat until all of the pieces have been browned on both sides. Turn the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 25 minutes.\n\npassage 3:Here's how you do it! 1  In a pot or a very deep pan, heat the oil to 350F. 2  Gently lower the chicken pieces into the oil.They should be completely submerged. 3  Cook the chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 165F. This'll take about 10 minutes for white meat, 14 for dark, and maybe 7 minutes for wings.\n\n"}
