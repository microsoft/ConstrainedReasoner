To lose such a wonderful bakery and a delightful place to linger over coffee or breakfast/lunch is a travesty! Exquisite bakery goods for parties, holidays, etc. are truly not available elsewhere. The owner is so nice and friendly making those of us who are regular customers feel like family. Her family members and employees have always made us feel the same. I am so sorry you have been bullied out, we will miss you terribly!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2014-12-07 08:21:17", "review_text": "Their pastry is made with crisco. Tastes Trimble and unhealthy.\nThey lie about the ingredients .\nThey have stayed in business because people have such low standards.\nWorst tasting pastry I ever had. Bad management bad service.\nOnly fools shop there."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2014-11-22 07:41:11", "review_text": "Don't come here if you're craving sweets. The array of baked goods with pound you into submission. I had a ganache here and it was really good. Not legendary good in the sense that I would go out of my way to get it but good enough that if I find myself in the vicinity I might peak through that glass display one more time. \n\nAt the time of this review I am craving an eclair. I'll edit my review later after I try it! If you would like to see how I rate the eclair, check back later? Bookmark the page.\n\nThe coffee here is ok, but don't have the mocha it's basically hot chocolate. But they are warm and tasty."}]}
