Kate Middleton shows 'Arrogance' after Gesture in France, says Stanton
A Royal Confidence Transcending the Rugby Field
On her visit to the Rugby World Cup, Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, demonstrated an unexpected and powerful display of confidence.
According to body language expert Darren Stanton, her 'bone-crushing' handshake and other gestures signified a profound level of inner belief and self-assurance.
The princess was present in Marseille to cheer on the England rugby team, who had just recorded a victory against Argentina in the World Cup quarter-final. However, her support did not stop at the stands.
As the royal patron of the English RFU, Middleton paid a surprise visit to the dressing room, congratulating the players on their recent victory.
Stanton analyzed the princess's body language during her interactions with the players. He pointed out a particular photo of Middleton shaking hands with one of the rugby players.
"It's a fantastic handshake. If you zoom in on that you can see it's a real bone crusher handshake, which is in a positive sense," Stanton explained.
This powerful gesture, according to Stanton, is a sign of respect and rapport. He also noted that Middleton's other gestures, such as placing her hand on a player's arm, indicated genuine happiness and respect.
Stanton believes that these gestures, along with Middleton's overall demeanor, highlight her growing confidence in her royal role.
"If we look at how the Princess of Wales has evolved, she used to be pretty quiet and downplay a lot of things. Whereas she handles things with a lot of self-assurance nowadays. In terms of how she walks, she walks with a swagger," Stanton said.
In Stanton's view, Middleton's powerful presence at the Rugby World Cup is a testament to her growing confidence and inner belief, making her a fascinating figure both on and off the rugby field.
