We were hoping they had bagels and vegan cream cheese for our road trip but unfortunately they did not.  We did try the seed cookie which was amazing and very filling. Also loved the cinnamon rolls. \nThey had an assortment of plant based cream cheeses that I would have loved to try. Unfortunately we were passing though and did not want to buy an entire container and large loaf."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-30 00:02:07", "review_text": "We came here at the recommendation of Low Pigeon Coffee Roasters, looking for some bakery items to munch on with our coffees. Unfortunately, it was more bread than sweets, but we still walked away with some hygge buns and the most delicious foccocia bread. I wish we lived in SB just so we could appreciate their other breads because I couldn't justify getting a loaf only to have it sit for days before being able to enjoy it in our kitchen at home."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-29 04:59:50", "review_text": "I got Half of a Seeded loaf. No flour. \n$15. Omg it was yum. Dense and complex. \nI don't live in the area but if I ever I'm in the area again I am definitely going to get the seeded loaf again."}]}
