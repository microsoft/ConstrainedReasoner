Very tasty stuff. Great Spanish Tapas in the evening and killer late night eats when the bars close. The great thing is it rarely has a line too because every college kid is lining up outside Fat Burger or Uncle Rocco's. Fun spot. Mole sauce is pretty killer."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2010-01-07 00:10:04", "review_text": "**Please see reviews under \"Chilango's Mexican Restaurant.\"**\n\nThere are a variety of reviews there.  I have been going to Chilango's for the past 7 years and it has always has fresh tasty food each time I have gone.  I have never been let down.  The chicken Axiote, chicken in cream sauce, and mole are all must tries!  Mmmm...yum!"}]}
