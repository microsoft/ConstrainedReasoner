{"question": "how do twins happen", "passages": "passage 1:Monoamniotic twins occur when the split takes place after the ninth day after fertilization. Conjoined twins: When the division of the developing zygote into 2 embryos occurs, 99% of the time it is within 8 days of fertilization. Mortality is highest for conjoined twins due to the many complications resulting from shared organs.\n\npassage 2:Dizygotic twin pregnancies are slightly more likely when the following factors are present in the woman: 1  She is of West African descent (especially Yoruba) 2  She is between the age of 30 and 40 years. 3  She is greater than average height and weight. 4  She has had several previous pregnancies.\n\npassage 3:Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy. Twins can be either monozygotic (identical), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic (fraternal), meaning that they develop from two different eggs. In fraternal twins, each twin is fertilized by its own sperm cell. In contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb is called a singleton, and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is multiple. Non-related look-alikes whose resemblance parallels that of twins are referred to as doppelgangers.\n\n"}
