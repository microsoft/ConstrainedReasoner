So many straws and you are on the ocean! Help the sea animals! Zoos are straw less for the animals. Be straw less for the sea animals!! Please help save the Ocean life!! To all the people that come to these places, say no to straws ahead of time. Bring you're own reusable cups with reusable straws. Have the shops give a discount for those that bring their own reusable straws and cups/bottles. One step at a time and we can do it."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2014-06-20 14:45:52", "review_text": "People come to SB for the beach, here you go! \n\nDecent sized pier to walk on and watch the fishermen and rowers.  A few shops and restaurants are at the end of the pier and they have some parking with a cost. It's really not that awesome but if you come to CA to see the beaches you should walk atleast one beach pier."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2012-08-23 07:24:32", "review_text": "Ive spent too much time here.The dockage fees are insane.The staff is great but thier hands are tied with crazy policies.The place is crawling with snobs that wont give you the time of day unless you have lots of money.Great place for people watching I guess."}]}
