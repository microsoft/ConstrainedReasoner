I live in LA and got married in Santa Barbara a few weeks ago and was planning to have a small wedding with close friends and family. We just wanted a simple yet delicious cake with cupcakes to accompany them. I did some research on Yelp and so glad I came across Delicious Expressions! Order process was super simple with the online order form and Liz was so easy to work with! When I mentioned to Liz that this is for our wedding, she offered to put some nice finishing touches to our cake and made it look really pretty. She reached out to me by text if she had any questions, which made it so easy for me to communicate with her. We ordered the vanilla and salted-caramel cake and an assortment of the chocolate cupcakes. Our cake and cupcakes were delivered to the restaurant before our reception and everyone loved them! Their menu has a bit of traditional and unique flavors and the cakes and cupcakes were really moist and delicious. The only thing I would change would be to order a bigger cake! Thank you Liz and crew for providing excellent service and good quality desserts for our wedding :)"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-01-23 05:03:45", "review_text": "I can't say enough about how delicious these cupcakes are and what incredible service this business provides. We had a couple of dairy free and gluten free guests for whom Liz specially prepared and marked cupcakes, not to mention the beautiful display and yummy cupcakes for  the rest of us at our girls' birthday party! You know it's good when the adults eat them too! Thank you Liz. We will definitely be calling you again!"}]}
