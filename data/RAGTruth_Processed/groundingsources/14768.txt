Perfect for working, meeting up with friends, hanging out.  Great inside and outside space.  Art focused, which I LOVE!\n\nIf I lived closer, this would be a regular spot."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2015-05-29 06:16:17", "review_text": "Decent coffee at an okay price. Some people like the decorations but I thought it was kind of messy and had a grandma-esque vibe too it. \n\nI got my usual, an iced coffee and HOT DAMN. It was strong...like a too strong for my tastes. I will come back to try their other drinks though. Not giving up on this place just yet!"}]}
