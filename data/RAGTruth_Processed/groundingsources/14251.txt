The place was relatively empty for a Saturday night...and I can see why. Just so mediocre! The ceviche we ordered was very bland with hardly any guacamole, and only a tiny portion of chips. For the price we paid, I expected better. I've given this restaurant a few chances before, mostly for the nice location- but will not be back."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2020-02-27 21:32:43", "review_text": "What a great view. Come to the rooftop, sit outside and enjoy the sun or rain, ( it is covered) and take in the harbor view.  Bar food and family friendly. I wish they had a bigger selection of local craft beers but they do have good cocktail list. Plus if you are just enjoying happy hour they have popcorn and great list of happy hour bites. Relax, enjoy the harbor view. Update: Today we decided to order lunch, unfortunately turned out to be overpriced and mediocre. We had halibut tacos and seafood pasta. Beans and rice barely warm, tacos tasteless (added hot sauce); tortilla chips stale tasting, did not eat. Hubby says seafood pasta was \"ok\" nothing special. Would recommend coming here to sit outside, enjoy the view, popcorn, beer or cocktail but skip the menu."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2020-02-24 00:05:14", "review_text": "I enjoyed my nachos; however, I did not care for customer service. I didn't leave tip and felt so uncomfortable by not but really trying to promote my gratitude when it's due and when there's a lack of, the same. I felt that \"my group\" had to wait longer than others and we were greeted by a receptionist/host that was not at her station so we saw sign that says it's ok to look for our seat, she hurried and corrected us that the sign should of been turned over, we needed to wait for assistance, we did, she joined us in looking for space. Our food again was tasty but throughout time we did not think we had experienced good customer service and so much that I did want to say thank you for what I considered less than mediocre service, my group didn't feel good."}]}
