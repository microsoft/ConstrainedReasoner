That said and given our current health crisis I was quite taken aback when I walked into the door and I watched the solo employee quickly slide his full coverage face mask up over his face. Not cool. Not cool at all. Who knows how long his face was uncovered while he was performing food prep operations. I'm just not into buying a sandwich that could possibly contaminated with Covid. It will be a long time before I ever go back. Pretty sad on the owner's part not to be enforcing basic sanitary guidelines. Plus who knows when this young man last sanitized his hands. Even sadder is that they lost my order of the day and many other future orders. \nRoughly $150 worth of business in cold cuts and multiple sandwiches...\nConsumers beware of these sad and pathetic health practices."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-05-03 22:21:35", "review_text": "It's tough to find a meal under 10$ in this town. But Nona's delivers. If you're looking for a classic no nonsense Italian sub, this place hits the spot! Also, Michelle is very friendly! Will definitely be revisiting for lunch."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-04-06 04:42:26", "review_text": "Dried up and barren.
