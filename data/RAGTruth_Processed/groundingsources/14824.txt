I ordered a bottle of rose. Without mentioning anything, the girl working grabbed a bottle off the shelf and poured me 2 glasses of warm rose. I definitely would have picked something else if she would've mentioned that she didn't have any chilled. I proceeded to ask her if she even had any ice (she didn't) then she handed me the warm bottle to take outside, rather than offering to chill it. Will come back to see if this was a fluke or if they just have poorly trained staff in general :("}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-10-03 16:47:28", "review_text": "Wine selection is great. It is hidden but its a must stop. Carlos is the best and he knows so much about wine. Highly recommend you stop in grab some wine or a drink and sit in the beautiful courtyard."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-03-15 03:14:54", "review_text": "This place is an absolute haven.
