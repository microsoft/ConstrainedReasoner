Our appetizers came very quickly (which was a major plus because I was starving!) Our waiter was sweet and very attentive. She checked up on us and repeatedly refilled our drinks  The food was served in a perfect portion and tasted delicious. (bacon burger and shrimp noodles) Not a very quiet setting because everyone is constantly hustling around (but it was a busy Saturday night)"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2014-02-01 22:42:23", "review_text": "I can see why it closed! We use to fly into this Airport just so we could eat at Elephant Bar.  The last time we went it was horrible!

We've enjoyed many excellent meals here over the years; and have celebrated some of our most memorable occasions at this restaurant.  The menu options have been some of the most interesting and varied in the Santa Barbara area.  We have experienced really good service, and Oscar has been outstanding as a manager and truly gracious host. He always greeted regular patrons as if they were family.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and this establishment will be greatly missed."}]}
