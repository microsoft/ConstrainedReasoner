We had a mimosa and looked out at the great view.  We saw some wonderful-looking breakfast items being delivered around us (we had already eaten). My dad (89 years old) living in Northern California called while we were there and he remembers from 40+ years ago that they had great ice cream. He was right: we had the coffee one. Terrific!\n\nWe came back the next morning for breakfast and enjoyed a whole bottle of champagne (the cheapest way to do it).  Our food was excellent and huge servings.  The staff and manager are very friendly and very welcoming."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-23 17:02:22", "review_text": "Hey Guys sometimes our best Experiences are Right under our Nose  The Breakwater Restaurant an Iconic Santa Barbara Eatery.

The line wasn't  long, and we got a table in about 5min. The staff was friendly. The menu  is very outdated. A little pricey (paying for the view?). And the food  was just OK."}]}
