The lounge setting and ambience was wonderful and relaxing. The dinning room had subtle elegance.  The bread was warm and tasty, butternut squash soup and the romaine wedge salad was delicious. The service was outstanding. All was wonderful until the main course. The short  ribs tasted like pot roast and the New York steak was ok-needed salt.  We really wanted it to be great but the main dishes lacked flavor. Now for dessert... Butterscotch pudding and lemon cheesecake were excellent.  We really wanted to give 4 stars but 3 is all we can give it."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-03-20 03:27:00", "review_text": "We were all very tired after a long day of work and being on the road, so we decided to try the restaurant in our hotel, which was conveniently located in our hotel's lobby.\n\nWe started our evening sharing the roasted California mussels seasoned perfectly and served with sourdough bread.  Then for our main course my daughter and I shared the savory manilla clams served over hand cut tagliatelle seasoned with basil, lemon and chile.  My husband ordered the crisy duck breast over potato gnocci and told both the waiter and I how he was in heaven that they had created a dish with two of his favorite meals put together in one.  We topped off the night with a bottle of Conundrum wine and a serving of their warm, comforting bread pudding and ice cream and called it a night!\n\nThe service was friendly and quick, and the food was delicious.  We will definitely be back the next time we're visiting the wonderful city of Santa Barbara!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2013-03-16 18:15:54", "review_text": "We decided to eat at Coast tonight because we wanted to try something different in Santa Barbara.  We ordered  the mussels, the pork belly sliders, shishito peppers and the pork ribs everything we had was really very good but the real stand out were the mussels the sauce was accompanied with a sourdough toast that was delicious.  Just before we left James Siao the head chef came out and talked to us we told him how he really enjoyed the meal."}]}
