He doubled Scott's rent!  DOUBLED!  The only location is now their Carpinteria location on Linden Avenue across from Amtrak.  This was a legacy in Santa Barbara. I grew up standing in line like the rest of us at the old lower state street location, that guy raised his rent through the roof, so they moved.  That space has been vacant for over 9 years...and still is.  \nThis was the BEST place to get lunch and breakfast in SB for decades.  Glad some greedy jerk decided to end that for the rest of us...."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-05-27 04:14:59", "review_text": "Say it ain't so! KEYT3 News has on their Mobile app that Esau's is closing? The rent is too high? When are people going to realize that there are some things (think tradition) that trump the almighty dollar!  Wow! Perhaps with a little luck it will be replaced with an IHOP, Coco's, or, better yet, another (insert plastic fast food emporium here) because we sure need another one of them (think breakfast tacos?) Yucch. This evening just made a turn for the worst. So sad........."}]}
