I met one nice employee my first time at this location who was from San Diego like me. She made conversation and was genuine. My other experiences have been far from this, the employees are agitated and do not make any conversation. Honestly very disappointed because this is the second location I have been to with poor customer service."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-14 16:01:47", "review_text": "We happened to drive through SB yesterday and were craving some good juice so we stopped by Pressed. We ordered our usual Berry Smoothies, which were delicious as always.\n\nThe only thing that prevents me from giving this location 5 stars... the staff. I walked inside and waited a bit for someone to come out from the back. It took so long that I awkwardly tried to look into the back to see if anyone was there lol. At one point I had to yell out, \"hello?\" to which a guy came out to help. He wasn't very friendly and seemed a bit annoyed that I came in but maybe it was just a bad day. \n\nAll in all, who knows how many people came in before me and gave up waiting for him."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-08 17:29:57", "review_text": "Pressed Juicery is known for their variety of healthy juices from their detox formulations to healthy citrus and greens flavors . They've expanded to what's called  \"Freeze\" which is their soft serve ice cream  product! Pictured is the chocolate soft serve with chocolate icing frozen on top, sliced strawberries  and coconut  flakes! It was sweet and refreshing with that nice freeze melting in your mouth!"}]}
