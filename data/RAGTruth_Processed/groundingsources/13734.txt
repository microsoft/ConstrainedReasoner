There is no table service, you order at the bar & sit where you can. They have a lot of heat lamps outside so was nice & toasty.\nI really enjoyed the Family Robinson drink. It was easy to drink, not too sweet & pretty refreshing. Hubby got a straight gin & tonic."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-01 01:33:33", "review_text": "Legit cocktail bar. We stopped in for drinks while exploring State St.\n\nThe interior is awesome. Maybe something like Haunted Mansion - very dark lighting with upscale ornate wallpaper and decorative touches. \n\nThe house cocktail list was seriously impressive looking. Each one was well designed and after trying three of them, they were also well executed. I really liked the \"Love it when you call me big Papa\". Super unique and delicious.\n\nInterior seating is minimal, but they added lots of seating in the middle of the street thanks to vehicle traffic restrictions."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-10-05 03:52:14", "review_text": "Great atmosphere and cool bar, however the service was incredibly slow, even just for a couple of beers. We stumbled upon this place while walking around town so we decided to pop in as it was very lively. \n\nI definitely prefer Test Pilot over this place, and they also had a very crowded weekend- but the service was still great. We tend to hop around to check out multiple bars to compare which ones we enjoyed the best. Probably a good idea to add more bartenders to improve the service as it seems that is what's missing in order to have a better experience at the Good Lion."}]}
