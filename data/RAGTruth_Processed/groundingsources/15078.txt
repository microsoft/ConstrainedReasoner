I came to this place because I wanted to treat a friend out to some Asian style karaoke who lived in Central California. This place was the closest that I saw that was between Southern and Central California. The first time that I came there was by myself. I was the only one who used the karaoke room. I do not think that a lot of people know about this karaoke place. This place also sell boba tea drinks as well. I stayed at the place to almost closing. The worker there was very nice in that she did not try to rush me out of the room since I was the only one there.\n\nThe 2nd time that I went there was when I reserved the small room for 3 people. The female coworker, who could have been the owner, was very nice to give us the medium sized room with no additional charge. The private karaoke rooms were very cute with the Hello Kitty Decorations. The sound system was good and the English song choices were enough to keep my friends and I entertained. We could have been there for a few more hours if we were not charged by the hour."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2019-03-04 20:59:03", "review_text": "UPDATE: My friends and I were looking forward to going on a Friday night and we finally found a time that was suitable for all of us. Even after Yelp and google both told us they were open at 7pm on a Friday evening, they were closed with no explanation. We even tried calling but they seemed to hang up after I got through. We were really disappointed that we drove all the way there and met up and some of us even canceled previous plans to go to karaoke just to find out that they were closed.\n\n\nThis is usually our go-to place for karaoke in Santa Barbara because it's the only room-style karaoke but the drinks and milk tea are lacking. For karaoke it is a good place to go with a big group of friends and just rent out a room. The rooms are not completely sound proof but who cares when you're having fun with friends. The only downside would be that some songs are hard to find with their system and they don't have any korean or Japanese songs that we could find. Other than that, it's a pretty good place for karaoke."}]}
