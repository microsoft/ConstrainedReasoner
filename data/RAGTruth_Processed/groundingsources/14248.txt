They themselves and their employees never wear them and they allow their selective customers to not wear them. They are extremely racist and o witnessed this with my own eyes as well as others were saying the same thing. They don't treat every customer fairly and it's very disturbing to see. I wouldn't spend a dollar a this establishment. Not to mention I witnessed the owner using dirty drink glasses to then serve others which is a huge health violation. Eeeek! A big no!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-10-02 04:49:33", "review_text": "Kitschy and cool, the Mercury Lounge is a true gem in Old Town Goleta. Everyone is welcome here to listen to some tunes, shoot some pool, or enjoy a tasty beverage from the tremendous staff.   This place has been rockin' and rollin' for years, booking fun bands from up and down the coast. \n\nIt's pretty small, but the atmosphere is fantastic and everyone is chill - though occasionally a hipster pod of loud grad students might necessitate a change of seats. There's a little patio out back, eclectic decor and seating is scattered about, and time seems to float by as you hang out in a place that would be cool in any era of history, from past to future. \n\nIt's worth the uber ride, and once you're out here, hit up the imperial. Same owners, same vibe, bigger patio. Both are great."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-04-15 00:47:59", "review_text": "We are big, big fans of The Merc. They have great art for sale, pop-ups, trivia nights, bands, movie nights, you name it, they do it!! \n\nOh and they also have awesome beer! They've always got something new and local on tap. They switch it up pretty frequently too. But don't worry, The Merc keeps our favorites on the shelf so we always know we'll have a winner at every visit. \n\nRecently, we went in during the quarantine. They'd been closed, but posted on facebook that they'd be open for a couple of hours for bottles to go. We hustled over to pick up some delicious beers we can't get in stores as well as some awesome hoodie sweaters!"}]}
