Friendly. Helpful. \nThey really show that they care about their guests. \nThe Asada burrito with everything is my go-to. The rice is well seasoned, the asada is tender and delicious.\nThe wife had chicken enchiladas verde and ate half of hers. Really good.\nSalsa bar is on point. \nTry this place, it's good!"}]}
