The Champagne Room was right next door and had great reviews so we checked it out. It's a pretty small place with cool intimate seating and a bar area. Lila was running the place when we went and was sooo great!! She was really funny and helpful. She suggested we split a bottle (can't remember the name), but it was soooo good! \n\nGreat place for the start of a night out!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-06-11 00:22:00", "review_text": "What a fantastic treat to find a dedicated hip champagne lounge in downtown Santa Barbara. They do offer mote than champagne - and their selection if champagne and sparkling wines are great. It's a great date place.  They have a lovely lounge atmosphere which is a throw back to a vintage french salon. Great for a group. A wonderful find and much needed addition to State Street."}]}
