'Bold and the Beautiful' Spoilers: Deacon/Sheila Fallout, Urges The Felon To Leave Finn Alone?
The Bold and the Beautiful (B&B) spoilers for the week of October 16 tease that Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) will remain determined to reconnect with her son, John 'Finn' Finnegan (Tanner Novlan). Soap Opera Digest reports that Deacon gives his fiance a piece of advice -- settle into their lives and leave Finn alone, for now!
As you can expect, Sheila will refuse to abandon the idea of reconnecting with Finn. She has an image in her head of her relationship with Finn and refuses to give up on it.
Soaps Spoilers reports that Deacon explains that Sheila shouldn't think of it as giving up. She must focus on herself and prove to Los Angeles residents that she's a changed woman. If she can do that, Finn could be more willing to give her another chance.
The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say that Deacon offers Sheila a job as a bartender. He believes that a job would give Sheila something to do and could prove to Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang), Hope Logan (Annika Noelle), and Finn that she is no longer a threat to their safety.
Sheila acknowledges that Deacon's advice of letting Finn go for now may be the right thing to do. However, she cannot do it. She wants him in her life. She's waited too long to reconnect with him. B&B fans know that Sheila does not exercise patience, so it'll be interesting to see how the ine-toe bandit handles Finn's big shutout.
