It is however quick and convenient. The espresso is good and the breakfast pastries are as well.

The inside looks warm and inviting, like a higher end Starbucks. There is very little seating Inside of you wanted to sip your tea in the shop. \n\nBe warned. It is pricey.  $6.50 for a large plain coffee or iced tea. It is not special coffee or tea either. It is not some fancy brewed with fancy bean coffee. It is just regular pump thermos style coffee you get when you have a meeting. The cups aren't unique, the beverages themselves are mediocre at best. You are just trapped and they know it.  Convenient if you are staying there and want to grab a coffee for the road, but you are better off stopping at Starbucks or another local  on the way."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-07-30 14:59:57", "review_text": "Expensive and bitter coffee. For $7, I was expecting a pour over. It was not a pour over. In fact, it was barely drinkable. I drank about 10% of it. I was in Solvang later in the morning and went to Good Seed Coffee to get my morning coffee fix. Delicious coffee there."}]}
