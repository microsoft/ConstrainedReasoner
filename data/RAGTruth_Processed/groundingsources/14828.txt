Both times, the service has been incredibly slow.\n\nThe last time my SO and I came here, it took nearly an hour for our food to come out, and when it did, they brought me a dish I hadn't ordered.  After almost an hour of waiting for food after we ordered, they had to make what I actually ordered.  This took additional time.  The carnitas quesadilla I ordered was actually good, but there were pieces of bone in the pork.\n\nThat morning, there was a golf event scheduled at the course, and there were more people than normal.  However, the grill hadn't brought in more people to cook, so there was only one person taking orders and one person cooking.  It seems really ridiculous today that the grill wouldn't have had the forethought to bring in additional cooks on a day which would most definitely see increased traffic.  Waiting an hour for breakfast is pretty ridiculous."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-10-20 20:11:23", "review_text": "Cafe is open to public (you don't have to be golfing to eat here).\nDelicious food! I always get the Ellwood sandwich, hubby always get the patty melt whenever we eat here.\nNever had a bad experience!\nBeautiful views of the golf course and ocean."}]}
