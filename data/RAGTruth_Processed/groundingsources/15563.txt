{"question": "how do compression fittings work", "passages": "passage 1:Compression fittings are to be used on stationary connections only... If you look critically at compression fittings, one thing is apparent... they are designed to inhibit the movement of the pipe outward from the fitting. However, they do a poor job preventing the pipe from turning within the fitting. To visualize this, take the example of the connection for a refrigerator icemaker.\n\npassage 2:That\u2019s a big no-no. If you need to replace the fitting, you must ensure that all the components of the replacement are new. Otherwise, you can expect the connection to leak sooner than you expect it to. We hope that you learned how does compression fitting work and why it\u2019s important in plumbing.\n\npassage 3:Compression fittings work by the compression of an \u2018olive\u2019 between two tapered surfaces and the pipe itself. The two surfaces are the body of the fitting (be it a valve, connector or any other type) and the nut. Using a spanner and a pair of grips the nut is tightened. This exerts pressure on the olive and bites it onto the pipe. Compression fittings work well if the pipe is clean and cut properly.\n\n"}
