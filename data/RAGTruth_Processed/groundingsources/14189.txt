You're trapped - they've got you by the tender bits.  You just have to ante up and hope for the best.... and often times the best is crap (figurative crap, not actual crap).\n\nDon't ask me about the time I ordered a $16 Ceaser salad in the O'Hare airport....I will go on and on for hours about how crap it was, and then you'll leave and I will be here just talking to myself.\n\n\nAnyways, when I was living in Los Angeles, every Wednesday my corworkers and I religiously went to the Wahoo's on Wilshire.  This carried on for years and we liked it (most of the time).\nThat location did suffer from being inconsistent but ultimately we liked the spot.\n\nThe other day, their Banzai burrito popped into my head and I had to have one.  Now living back in Santa Barbara, I enlisted a friend of mine who is UCSB alum to help me navigate the incredible bureaucracy that is even finding a place to park and paying for it, then walking the four miles to the Wahoo's location.\n\nI of course had the glorious banzai burrito: the asada was tender, the green sauce was green....it was nicely hot inside and out and delicious.  I believe that they do use microwaves which isnt ideal but this burrito was as good as I remember any of them being for the many years that I got them in LA!\n\nMy buddy had the chicken sandwich and he really like it as well.\n\nI will be back!!"}]}
