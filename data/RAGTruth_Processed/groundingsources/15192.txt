{"question": "how to clean under laptop keyboard without removing keys", "passages": "passage 1:One of the easiest ways to clean a laptop keyboard is to just buy a small hobby brush (similar to a makeup brush). They are cheap, running around 35 cents. Keep the brush in your laptop bag and occasionally brush in-between and under the keys. It takes three minutes and gets under and between keys.\n\npassage 2:Clean your laptop keyboard frequently to prevent stuck keys and bacterial growth. Turn off and unplug the laptop. Shake the keyboard over a trash can to remove any debris from underneath the keys. Spray compressed air underneath each key to loosen any remaining debris. Dampen a cloth with a small amount of warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Wipe the key surfaces with the cloth and clean between the keys with a damp cotton swab. Allow the keyboard to dry completely. Vacuum the keyboard with a soft brush attachment or hand vacuum.\n\npassage 3:Actually you can pour DI water (or distilled water) over the keyboard until clean followed by 90% isopropyl alcohol to remove the water then spray it with canned air until dry. I did that once after the kids spilled orange juice on my keyboard. I'm not sure I would use this technique for a laptop.\n\n"}
