It was because of the wonderful red-headed gal that was working your booth. She turned out to be charming, helpful and informative. I had never tried hummus before. She explained it to me and helped me choose just the right one. I ended up buying 2 the first week and many more since then. Last week she talked me into trying the bread and I'm glad she did. I love her and I love your product.\nEmployees like her are hard to find. (I'm really bad with names or I would add it)"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2018-08-31 07:15:44", "review_text": "This has to be the best hummus I've ever had and the chips are an added bonus!! They have so many hummus flavors to choose from. Seriously this stuff is compared to drugs. Once you have a taste it, you can't stop. Haha. For the past few years they would make their way up to Fresno's River Park Farmers Market. But sad to say, they didn't come up this year. I'm sure everyone who bought their hummus here in town was saddened when  Baba's hummus didn't make an appearance. I know my family and I were sad. \n\nI hope I find their hummus when I go to SLO next weekend. If the owner is reading this, please come back to Fresno and sell your amazing hummus!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-07-07 05:28:45", "review_text": "The baba spicy pepper with Harrisa is soooo good! It's a bit spicy so try it before you buy if you can't handle heat. But if you can give it a go. It's amazing."}]}
