There was only one other seated party when we arrived, but perhaps 5-7 food delivery drivers standing around. Our order was taken promptly but after that we were ignored for about 25-30 minutes. I had to get up to ask the server (who was zoned out on her phone) if we could have more water while we waited. She gave us water, but was totally unsympathetic to our wait. Then a person who came in about 20 minutes after us got his food, while we're still waiting for our appetizer. I once again got up to ask the server if they could check on our order, since at this point we've been there for 40 minutes (three total parties in the restaurant at this point). Once again, the staff were totally unsympathetic to the confusingly-long wait. Our food came out about 45 minutes after we arrived, and might have been about a 2-star meal if not for the total lack of service. Similar to other reviews here, we found the food fairly bland - a disappointment for the price - especially when there are other amazing Thai food places in town.  A bright spot was the apparently-new server who took over for the original person who was on her phone.  He was great and checked in with us regularly after delivering our food.  Good job new guy!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-09-30 04:27:54", "review_text": "Wow second ( or third.) price increase since Covid started. And certainly not a modest increase.... On average of 30-40% higher per item since a year ago. Far beyond any normal price or salary increases. \nMaybe it's about maximizing profits on the increase demand for take out during the pandemic. \nEx. The Curries and Pad Thai went from $12  to $16 now. \nThe Larb and Papaya salads bumped from $11 to $15.60. \nAnd a simple Tom Kha Soup.. from $7 to $9.75 \nWe've always found the food to be pretty good even if the portions were a bit skimpy. But as the prices have climb ...well the portions are even skimpier... tonight our Pad Thai had one shrimp and 3 pieces of chicken in the whole dish....it's too bad. \nLooks like someone there is all about pushing the edge to see how high can you charge and  for how little.? \nGood question. My guess is you may soon find out and end up making less profit even with higher prices.  Ex.  We used to order weekly and now ... we'll not so often and not so much. But hey I could be wrong."}]}
