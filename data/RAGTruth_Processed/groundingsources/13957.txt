300,000 electric skateboards manufactured in California recalled; Four deaths blamed on 'One Wheels'
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Future Motion Inc., a Santa Cruz-based electric skateboard developer, have initiated a recall of approximately 300,000 Onewheel Self-Balancing Electric Skateboards after users died or suffered traumatic life-altering injuries from using the transportation devices.
The decision to recall these electric skateboards comes after dozens of reported incidents, tragically resulting in four deaths between 2019 and 2021.
Furthermore, numerous injuries have been reported, including traumatic brain injuries, concussions, paralysis, upper-body fractures, lower-body fractures, and ligament damage.
The recall encompasses all models of Future Motion Onewheel self-balancing electric skateboards, including Onewheel (original), Onewheel+, Onewheel+ XR, Onewheel Pint, Onewheel Pint X, and Onewheel GT. Consumers can identify the model by checking the side of the skateboard, where the model name is displayed.
The Onewheel logo is also visible on the rail of the skateboards.
The CPSC has issued a warning to all consumers, emphasizing the necessity to immediately cease using the recalled Onewheel electric skateboards due to the grave risks they pose.
However, it's important to note that Future Motion initially resisted the recall in November when the CPSC first urged customers to halt the use of these skateboards. According to CNN, the company eventually relented, agreeing to the recall in light of the mounting safety concerns.
For those with the Onewheel GT, Onewheel Pint X, Onewheel Pint, or Onewheel+ XR electric skateboards, Future Motion is urging them to download or update the Onewheel app.
By using the app, consumers can update the firmware on their boards to include Haptic Buzz alert functionality, enhancing safety measures.
