California Court Halts Chino Valley's Gender Identity Disclosure Policy
Los Angeles, California (LAI) - A recent oral ruling from the San Bernardino Superior Court has led to a preliminary injunction against the mandatory gender identity disclosure policy of the Chino Valley Unified School District Board of Education. This ruling effectively suspends the policy, which was considered harmful to the well-being of transgender and gender-nonconforming students.
The halted policy initially required schools to notify parents if a student chose to use a name or pronoun differing from the information on their birth certificate or official records. The policy also mandated that schools inform parents if students accessed facilities or participated in programs inconsistent with their official gender designation. This was to be carried out even without the student's consent and in cases where such disclosure could lead to emotional, psychological, or physical harm to the student.
The oral ruling concluded that the State of California is likely to win the case based on merits. It was stated that such mandatory disclosure policies are in violation of California's Equal Protection Clause. This development comes after a temporary restraining order was previously issued against the policy on September 6, 2023.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta applauded the ruling, stating that it is a significant step forward in upholding the rights of transgender and gender-nonconforming students. Bonta also issued a stern warning to other school districts contemplating similar policies, stating that discriminatory practices would not be tolerated in educational institutions.
The lawsuit against the Board, announced on August 28, 2023, by Attorney General Bonta, alleges multiple violations, including:
Infringement on California’s Equal Protection Clause.
Violation of California's Education and Government Code, which ensures equal rights and opportunities and prohibits discrimination based on gender identity.
Violation of California’s constitutional right to privacy, which includes both informational and autonomy privacy.
Judge Michael Sachs further elaborated in his oral ruling that provisions of Chino Valley's policy are "facially unconstitutional" as they violate state constitutional protections and discriminate against transgender and gender-nonconforming students. The ruling continues to prohibit the enforcement of provisions requiring parental notification under specified circumstances.
Attorney General Bonta has been an active advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, providing consistent guidance to educational authorities and initiating civil rights investigations when necessary.
A copy of the ruling granting the preliminary injunction will be made available for public viewing.
