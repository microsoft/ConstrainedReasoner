The place was a bit of an institution and had been around for quite a while. If it's gone, it will definitely be missed.\n\nMy GF and I were regulars here when we lived in SB.  Their Mexican food was just OK, but for a late morning breakfast right on State Street they can't be beat.  Their Chorizo and eggs were the bomb, especially if you're nursing a hangover.\n\nOn weekends they used to turn the place into a Salsa dance club, which was always fun and attracted a lot of locals.  The place is small and got a little crowded sometimes, but the music was often live, which made it worth having your personal space invaded.  It was a great venue for us to try out the Salsa moves we learned over at the Carrillo Ballroom.  \n\nSome weekends it was Swing on Fridays at the Ballroom and Salsa on Saturdays at Ruby's.  Both within walking distance of home. Tell me SB isn't awesome."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2012-06-16 16:14:24", "review_text": "I'm confused.  It looks like a review in 2010 said they closed, but then there is a review in 2011 - Are they in biz or no?\n\nI will tell you the truth people.  I went to school in SB between 2002 and 2004.  This was such a great breakfast joint.  The mexican breakfasts were incredible.  The service is not great, BUT actually developed kind of a funny repore with the staff over time.  They were rude and awkward, but I would deal with that to get to the food, because it was that good. My waiter would never give me the check but would always hand it to my boyfriend, he would hand me the check folder but there would be nothing in it and then secretly hand it to my boyfriend.  Pretty funny.  Anyway here is the lowdown.  Ruby's owners:  I loved your breakfasts so much!  Please give me these recipes - I'll pay!!!  Green chile and eggs - to die for!!! every bite was pure heaven, I never left anything on the plate, Machaca and eggs - never had it taste so good ever, Chorizo and eggs - I always like Chorizo but sometimes really greasy as some people make it - All I remember here is delicious.  My old beau really loved this place too and we made it a habit.  I miss the food and really need to know if they are still open, because I talk about them still!!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2011-02-28 03:32:10", "review_text": "I've been here a few times for breakfast. The food is decent, prices are fair, and the portions are good sized. I usually order the chilaquiles or a veggie omelet with lots of salsa and corn tortillas. They will gladly accommodate vegetarians and vegans. \nThe nice thing about this restaurant is the variety of dishes. They have something for everybody. They serve Mexican and traditional American food, including burgers and assorted egg dishes for those who aren't big fans of chiles and cilantro. It's great to be with a group and share each other's home fries and refried beans. \nOnce we came by at night while they had a band playing old Santana hits. I think they still have live music."}]}
