The guy who brought the food seemed angry about something the way he barked out the dish names, asking which dish was for whom. Our main server was friendly though, which made up for his tardiness :-)\n\nThe veggie burger was good, although the blue cheese was a little too salty. I had high expectations for Herbie's potato skins (as I love potato skins) but they were a bit disappointing. However, the Japanese saut\u00e9ed tofu dish was very good and this helped elevate the experience to memorable.\n\nChef Leonard Schwartz describes the dish as follows: \"Composed of fresh baby spinach saut\u00e9ed lightly in extra virgin olive oil and topped with slices of firm marinated tofu and wok-cooked shitake mushrooms and green onions, surrounded in a Japanese vinaigrette flavored with sesame oil, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, and lime juice.\"\n\nWe had a guest request a vegan dish about a year and a half ago, and that's when I put together the tofu dish,\" he said. Well, I'm glad you had one guest who cares about the planet! (And props to the chef too.)\n\nI'm giving Lucky's only 2 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, for these simple reasons:\n\u00b7 Lucky's menu is meat-focused. It would be great if Lucky's made a stand and adapted its menu a little to help out with our climate crisis, not to mention mitigating deforestation and putting an end animal cruelty and the insidious negative impact that the meat industry has on society. You did a great job with the tofu and spinach dish, so keep going!\n\u00b7 No information is provided on food sourcing. Where does it come from? Are the eggs pasture-raised? Is the tofu organic? Communication of these things actually matter, even for something vegan like tofu, which ranges from industrially-farmed GM soy that's sprayed with bee-killing neonics to one of the most sustainable products on the planet (more here: https://greenstarsproject.org/2019/06/13/sustainable-tofu-brands-soy-deforestation-ethics/)"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 01:56:42", "review_text": "Interestingly we've been here a few times, normally one of our stops for dinner while in town, however, this time was absolutely not great.  Bland over cooked food, poor service, and sub par in general, not a good look for the most expensive steak house open with expectations of such.  When the waiter clears you plate still full of food and fails to even ask if everything was ok, tells me they don't care.  This will more than likely be my last visit to Luckys, there are just too many restaurants that are doing good things to pay supremely overpriced fares for lackluster food"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-27 00:53:17", "review_text": "Honestly the food is not worth the price you're paying. In harsh words, this place is for the rich people who don't know taste. Don't waste your money here. I came from 2 hours out of town and wanted to treat my boyfriend for our anniversary so we chose this spot since it had good reviews. Staff could have been more lively but it seemed like they didn't care about us because we don't look of money. Now the food, the waiter recommended the $70 dollar steak which I said I would give a try if he's speaking so highly of it. I ordered it to be cooked medium. I got it rare, not even medium rare, but RARE. Next time it came out it was cooked a little too well but I didn't want to bother again so I tried it and my gosh was it bland. It tasted nothing like what was described and I don't even think there was either salt or pepper at the minimum. Not to mention the price is JUST for steak no sides or anything. So I ordered mashed potatoes as well and it tasted like BOX mashed potatoes. After that I lost my appetite and asked for the bill. Still ended up paying 100 for 1 entr\u00e9 and an appetizer. If you want ACTUAL good food for a fair price go somewhere else. 10/10 DO NOT recommend this place."}]}
