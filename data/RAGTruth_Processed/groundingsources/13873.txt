Charlotte, Louis, and Prince George all dive into the kitchen as Kate unveils important roles
During the October half-term, Princess Kate has been spending the last few weeks at home with her kids. She has already disclosed that one of their favorite activities to do together is cooking.
Even though Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis are not enrolled in school, they can still assist with food preparation for the family.
Currently, the three are students at Lambrook School near Windsor, which is close to their family home Adelaide Cottage.
During a royal visit to Lavender Primary School in 2019, Kate engaged the kids in conversation about their favorite foods to prepare together, noting that her kids especially enjoyed getting a little messy.
Cheesy spaghetti is a family specialty, and George, Charlotte, and Louis all play significant parts in the crucial noodle and sauce preparation process.
Following the visit, Ivy Learning Trust CEO Matthew Kleiner-Mann remarked, "She was telling us how much her children love cooking and how they cook for her."
"They recently prepared cheese-topped spaghetti. One mixes the flour, while the other adds the butter and milk. They also prepare salads and other things."
Since Kate mentioned that she and the kids also cultivate veggies in their garden, the Wales family now has access to healthy food.
The family grows their own vegetables, including carrots, beans, and beetroots; Louis, the youngest, particularly enjoys beetroot despite its strong flavor, Kate revealed to Mary Berry in 2019.
The Princess revealed to the renowned chef, "We grow our own vegetables, we've got carrots, beans, beetroot's a massive favorite, Louis absolutely loves beetroot."
She also made fun of the fact that her daughter "loves her Charlotte potatoes" by default, but olive is an intriguingly sophisticated favorite of the young monarch.
Pizza cooked with Mary Berry's pizza dough is another delight that Kate makes with her children since she believes that cooking with them is a crucial aspect of their development.
Allowing her family to "be creative and as independent as possible with it" is something the Princess expressed her preference for.
Another charming anecdote from Kate states "Because all my cooking books are in the kitchen bookshelf right at his height," Mary was actually one of the first things Louis said.
She continued: "And children are really fascinated by faces, and your faces are all over your cooking books and he would say, 'That's Mary Berry', so he would definitely recognize you if he saw you today."
