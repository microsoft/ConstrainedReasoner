One of the issues staying at Mar Monte is finding good restaurants a short distance away... but look no further as both Costa and Cafe Lido are fantastic choices. I have to say that I was impressed.  \n\nFOOD: Had the tagliatelle bolognese, rigatoni pomodoro, chargrilled broccolini, and salmon dishes. All the dishes were really good. I particularly enjoyed the tagliatelle and broccolini. Take a look at my pics. \n\nSERVICE: Two thumbs up here. Our waiter was very patient and attentive. \n\nLOCATION: This restaurant is inside the Mar Monte hotel and across the beach. Even had its own small parking lot for customers not staying at the hotel. \n\nNOTEWORTHY: Great view of the ocean, fantastic food, and great service. All-in-all, extremely pleased with this place, definitely a place I would go back to."}]}
