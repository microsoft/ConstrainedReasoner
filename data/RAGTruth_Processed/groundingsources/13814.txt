Social Security Benefits to Increase by 3.2% in 2024
Los Angeles, California (LAI) - Over 66 million retirees receiving Social Security checks will see a 3.2% increase in their monthly government payments in 2024, thanks to the Social Security Administration's cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The announcement was made by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on October 12, 2023.
On average, Social Security retirement monthly benefits will grow by more than $50 starting in January 2024. The COLA adjustment aims to help retirees keep up with increasing living expenses, providing a measure of inflation protection.
In addition to the COLA increase, other adjustments take effect every January based on the increase in average wages. As a result, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax (taxable maximum) will increase to $168,600 in 2024, up from $160,200 in 2023.
The annual COLA is tied to the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, as determined by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI report indicates the impact of the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation through interest rate hikes.
Beneficiaries will receive notices of the increase in early December, and those with a personal My Social Security account can view their COLA notice online. They can also set up text or email alerts for new messages regarding COLA until November 14.

The Senior Citizens League (TSCL) previously estimated a 3.2% COLA for 2024, based on consumer price data through August. While this is lower than the 8.7% COLA received in 2023, it is higher than the 20-year average of 2.6%.
A 3.2% COLA in 2024 would increase the average monthly retiree benefit of $1,790 by $57.30, according to the TSCL.
