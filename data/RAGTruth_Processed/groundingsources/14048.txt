As I started eating I thought \"hmm the beyond meat tastes different this time\"Halfway through my burrito I made the realization that this was not in fact vegan and I had been eating carnitas. I immediately vomited across the  dashboard of my car, steering wheel and lap. Got a refund but now my car is a mess and I need to go change my clothes. If you want vegan food just pay the extra couple bucks and go to Mesa Verde or Modern Times."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-12 01:28:38", "review_text": "My wife loves their Tacos, best she's had in Santa Barbara.
