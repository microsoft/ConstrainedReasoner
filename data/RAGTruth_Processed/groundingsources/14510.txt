Except for: all of the salsas are spicy none were mild enough for my 6 yearold, but I thought they were good!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-09-09 16:17:26", "review_text": "One of my coworkers brought this to lunch and it smelled really good, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered a half/half plate, with both tri-tip and chicken. Unfortunately, the plate didn't live up the my expectations. The chicken was greasy and the tri-top was bland. Neither had very good flavor. However, the beans and rice were pretty good, and the salsa was the best part of the meal, as it was full of flavor. I would maybe try here again, but order a burrito instead."}]}
