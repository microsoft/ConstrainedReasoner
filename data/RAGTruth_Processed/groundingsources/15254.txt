{"question": "difference between an adverb clause and an adjective clause", "passages": "passage 1:An adverb clause is a dependent clause that modifies a verb, adjective or another adverb. It usually modifies the verb. Adverb clauses are introduced by subordinate conjunctions including after, although, as, as if, before, because, if, since, so that, than, though, unless, until, when, where, and while.\n\npassage 2:Parts of the Sentence - Adjective, Adverb, and Noun Clauses. The adjective clause is used to modify a noun or a pronoun. It will begin with a relative pronoun (who, whose, whom, which, and that) or a subordinate conjunction (when and where). Those are the only words that can be used to introduce an adjective clause.\n\npassage 3:Adjective Clauses. Adjective clauses are dependent clauses that modify nouns or pronouns. Much like adverbial clauses, students who are trying to identify adjective clauses should try to determine what kinds of questions the clause in questions answers.\n\n"}
