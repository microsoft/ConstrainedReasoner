The Oysters are very fresh and tasty too, will recommend it to any people that are a big fan of Oysters or seafood. 5-star rating from me to this place."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-09 01:11:00", "review_text": "I took my granddaughter here today & deeply regret it.  At the first bite I should have refused it and moved on but I didn't want to upset my granddaughter who was hungry.  We both had fish & chips.  The fish was so bad that I asked the waiter what kind it was.  He said \" it's red snapper, does it taste funky ?\"  I'd like the restaurant to prove that wasn't the lowest quality tilapia on the market.  It tasted like metal and mud. The manager & owner should take some home to their families & see the reaction. It's vile.  The whole place is run down & I should have left immediately."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-26 01:33:08", "review_text": "Thanksgiving dinner was awful. Service was discriminatory and catered to others much more. Was given plastic cutlery and nobody even gave us menus. \nHad to get my own menu, find a server and nobody told us about any specials. \nAbsolutely ruined my day and would request you to go somewhere else unless you like to be disappointed."}]}
