The food is great, adorable little restaurant. The service was spot on, not too pushy but always there when you need something. TRY the salad with apples & fried Brie cheese. To die for!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2016-09-24 21:00:19", "review_text": "Conveniently located. Food and service were very adequate. Our waiter was very accommodating and split a sandwich for us for no extra charge. The serving sizes were modest which was just what we wanted. Can you believe that they actually had a 1/4 lb. hamburger? It is so hard to find a restaurant that serves a healthy sized hamburger. I would go back for breakfast or lunch any time. Prices were fair."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2016-07-25 22:26:38", "review_text": "Delicious food, excellent service.  The chicken piccata was very tasty."}]}
