A couple days ago my wife randomly decided she'd book a hotel in Santa Barbara for the weekend. She said she had already found a good spot for brunch Sunday morning. Usually I plan all the trips so she had a lot of pressure not to disappoint. And... she did not. Moral of the story: here we are now, just enjoyed a delicious breakfast burrito (her) and steak/eggs/frites (me). Most importantly the \"mimosa madness\" was served just the way I like it, just a splash of juice. This may have influenced this review :)\nOur server Jamie was awesome and very hospitable. 5 stars for food, ambiance, and service. We'll be back some day."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-24 05:45:27", "review_text": "main downside is that the food was overpriced. taste and quality of the food was great and service was also good. ambiance is nice, the restaurant is located in a hotel lobby."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-21 03:21:40", "review_text": "The best bottomless brunch! $14 for the first mimosa, and $1 for every mimosa after that. \n\nWe came on a Sunday for brunch and we didn't have to wait which was nice. The restaurant is inside a VERY nice hotel, and I was shocked at how cheap the menu is, given how nice the ambiance is. \n\nOur server Matthew was great. We were in SB for the day and he was giving us tips on what to do & where to go. He was very outgoing & kind, and the service was fast and on point. \n\nThe food was good as well, I got the eggs benedict and it was filling & delicious. The mimosas were BOMB and so cheap... we paid only $16 each for bottomless! They also have different flavors: orange, grapefruit, and poinsettia/cranberry which were all v tasty. \n\nDEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone looking for a good bottomless brunch!"}]}
