Even more than the absolutely delicious food (my son said it was the best tri-tip he's ever had), beautiful presentation (the appetizer table in my dining room was 5 star hotel quality), Kristi is like having your own party planner with excellent suggestions for service providers, decor, timing and coordination with party rentals.   Her staff (mostly family) helped decorate, drew up the plan for the dining area, provided wonderful bartenders and support.  And they do this with precision and a fun, pleasant attitude that gives any host confidence and relieves stress.  Our guests not only loved every item on the buffet, but loved interfacing with Kristi and her wonderful crew.  It was just the elegant but casual atmosphere we wanted to achieve....thank you, thank you with love!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-05-24 16:47:19", "review_text": "VERY accommodating for my last minute party. Menu was customized for our needs and turned out wonderful. It was a huge hit! We had a party of 20 adults 10 kids, very casual celebration outdoors due to COVID restrictions. Everything was perfect. Friendly staff, delicious food, reasonable price."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-05-12 23:31:57", "review_text": "10 Stars!! KRISTI IS AMAZING!!! 2 months ago I was planning a birthday event for my client 300 miles away. From the instant we communicated Kristi was the most helpful and comforting person ive ever met. We were in constant contact discussing menu options, adaptation to beverages, seating etc. She stepped in and beautifully decorated the space(had my co workers and I jealous we weren't there to physically enjoy it) assisted in rentals and contracts. AND THE FOOD!!!! My boss called me with a mouth full of pulled pork and I knew that everyone at the party was heading into a delicious food coma. We were able to alter our event menu to better suit my client and her needs, which was incredible! I heard nothing but tasty reviews from my client and her staff. literally.. finger, licking good.\n\n I AM BEYOND GRATEFUL for Kristi and her team. I could have never imagined I would receive so much support for this event and 80 happy bellies full of BBQ to prove it all. THANK YOU, THANK YOU!"}]}
