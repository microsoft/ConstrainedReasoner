Classic French cuisine - French onion soup and frogs legs. Prices are surprisingly reasonable.

So much fun to be there up close and personal with the Bartender Amber as she created very special cocktails, and also made some spot-on food suggestions. Her depth of knowledge in both the world of spirits and food was much appreciated.\n\nTheir Bar Menu/Petit Plats offers a wide array of dishes, and we started right away with the Pate de Campagne, and Oeufs Mimosa. Both incredibly delicious, and with so much happening on those plates. \n\nFor our Plats Principaux/Specialitees, we enjoyed the Chicken Cordon Bleu, and Fettucchini Alfredo Au Poulet. Both very aromatic and tasty.\n\nIt was truly a special night of good food and drink, and fun conversations, and I am excited to share this dining experience with family and friends."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-25 03:39:48", "review_text": "One of my favorite restaurants!
