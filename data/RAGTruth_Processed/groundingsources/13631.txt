The waitress never even cracked a smile. We were very thankful for our ONE water refill.\n\nFood: It's never a good sign when you hear the microwave dinger go off more than the order bell.

The salsa bar is fantastic,  and the service from Beto's family and the crew is wonderful. Tacos Altamirano are unbelievably tasty as well. Skip the place up the street. This has no line and the food is fresh and wonderful. Love, love, love this place!"}]}
