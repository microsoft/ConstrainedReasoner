Focus on the fact that you WILL get money to leave your husband. It\u2019s just a matter of time and planning. And taking action.\n\npassage 2:When a person comes to me asking, can one spouse save a marriage, my answer is a qualified yes.. I see one spouse saving a marriage almost every week. The way it's done is that the one spouse teaches the other spouse how to negotiate fairly.\n\npassage 3:May you see that money is helpful, but it won\u2019t make you happy. I pray for wisdom and guidance as you gain insight into yourself and your situation, and for clarity as you think about how to get money to leave your husband. I pray for peace and joy, and a strong connection with your Creator. Amen.\n\n"}
