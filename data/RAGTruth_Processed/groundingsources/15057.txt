Literally not only is it the best place to eat in IV its just got a warm spot in my heart. Food is always delicious and served by the kindest and most dedicated people. I just cant say enough good things. I think comparatively to any place in IV its way better to spend your money on things that arent just frozen and fried for you. I feel good eating here and it's really a pleasure to interact with all the people behind the counter. Just so f'ing good!! Everything is worth trying"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 18:09:57", "review_text": "Mind boggling delicious! My friends and I went there and we all utterly adored what we ordered. The Tikki Masala was spectacular and the cheese naan nearly stole the show! I'm super excited to go back and even more confused about how this place only has 3 stars!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-11 20:50:00", "review_text": "The food is always delicious and the staff helpful and pleasant to interact with.
