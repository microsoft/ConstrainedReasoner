This was our 1st and last visit. We went with the waiter's recommendation, the Albacore  Tuna. We had it cooked medium, our other guest had it cooked the way the chef recommended. It was tough, tasteless, and just plain awful. Absolutely no flavor really. And it sat on top of the worse polenta I have ever tasted. The menu is limited, and it is very expensive for what you get. $16 for 1 glass of wine. $27 for tough albacore. They brought us something that looked like onion rings, but tasted like cheetos for an appetizer. \nNo bread, and if you wanted potatoes with your dish, it was an extra $5.00. Really not good."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-07 08:22:47", "review_text": "We were just passing through SB and found La Paloma Cafe.  It was excellent!  JTs salad was fresh and eclectic.  The vegetable verde pozole was flavorful.  GiGi our server was helpful and knowledgeable.  I'll be back when I don't have to drive to try the cocktails!"}]}
