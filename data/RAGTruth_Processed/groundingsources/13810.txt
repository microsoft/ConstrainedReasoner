'Big Brother 25' Spoilers: POV Meeting Results-- Is Cameron's Game Really Over?
Big Brother 25 (BB25) spoilers tease that the week 10 target is set and should go without much drama. Big Brother Network reports that Jag Bains won the Power of Veto (POV) competition and used it to save Felica Cannon from the chopping block.
After Jag vetoed Bowie Jane's nomination, the HOH had to name a replacement nominee. She put Cameron Hardin on the block, making him the target for the week.
BB25 spoilers say that Bowie started the week with Felica as her target. She put Cirie Fields on the block next to Felica. She claimed that the nominations were in retaliation for Red Utley's eviction.
Bowie considered putting Blue Kim or Cory Wurtrnberger on the block at the Veto meeting. But she reconsidered after hearing how much the other houseguests wanted Cameron out of the house.
Big Brother 25 spoilers say that Cameron told the house that Cory and America Lopez would be the target after he leaves the house. With him in the house, he will continue to be the target. He's shielding Cory and America from being the next big target.
Blue tells Cirie that they need to win the next HOH competition to take a shot at Matt Klotz and Jag. She wants Jag out of the house immediately. She doesn't think he can be trusted. Blue mentioned that Jared Fields' downfall was trusting Jag.
Cameron continues to campaign to stay over Cirie. He refuses to give up, vowing to campaign until the last minute. He believes eventually, he will figure out a path to stay over the Survivor legend.
It looks like Cameron's game is over, but with two days before eviction, he could convince a few people to flip their vote. He only needs four votes to stay.
