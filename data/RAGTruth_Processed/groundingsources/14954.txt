I've patronized the restaurants but have never stayed at the Hotel, therefore this review is for the restaurant, the grounds and the banquet facilities. Located on the beach the Spanish influence decor has intricate design and colors through out the Hotel. Over the years the Hotel has gone through ups and downs and since it has become a Four Seasons Hotel the facilities has been upgraded with a spa area just across the street. The rates have increased considerably too. The grounds are lush with beautiful flowers and plants. \n\nMost recently we attended a large wedding where they held the ceremony in the courtyard, then the reception in their new banquet facilities in the spa area. Outside the banquet room there is a large deck right on the water with chairs and lounges. After a gorgeous sunset, it was a cool breezy night and hors d'oeuvres and drinks were served under heaters. The banquet room was large and had a enormous dance floor which accommodated the large wedding party. I had the filet mignon and my wife had the fish both of which were OK.\n\nValet parking only. The valets are really polite, fast and efficient. Service was good."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-04-03 21:58:45", "review_text": "When my parents were deciding whether they were going to move to Santa Barbara, CA from Des Moines, IA they made the mistake of staying at the Biltmore. Of course they ended up moving!\n\nThe resort's grounds alone are beautiful--the landscaping and tiles are so detailed and fun to walk through. Sometimes my mom and I go back to get a facial here, and I actually did my senior photos here so long ago. Butterfly Beach (the beach in front of the Biltmore) has remained a favorite for my family, and especially for my dog--but let's be honest, any beach is Henry's favorite beach.\n\nWhen my boyfriend came to meet my family for the first time, Butterfly Beach was the first place that I took him because I wanted him to have a great first impression of Santa Barbara. Come to think of it, Butterfly Beach is the place that I take all of my friends and family from Los Angeles or from Des Moines. (Favorite thing to do: Get a latte from Jeanine's in Coast Village and then walk down to Butterfly Beach for a nice morning walk.)"}]}
