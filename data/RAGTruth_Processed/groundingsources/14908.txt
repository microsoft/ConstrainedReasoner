That's about the only thing that is epic about it. I got the Rincon bowl, which seemed to have the potential to be amazing, but it definitely fell short.  Not very sweet--and if you're not into sweet stuff, not very memorable period in my opinion.\n\nAlso, the customer service was terrible. Went in and the worker strolled on over to the cash register and it felt like she was more so forced to wait on us against her will, rather than was being paid for it. My friend left her purse in the shop, and when we called back 7 minutes later, the lazy workers did not even check the floor for us, but said that no one had seen a purse. We came back in and found the purse sitting right where it had been accidentally left--on the chair, in plain site. \n\nI will never return to this place unless they add some kind of \"epic\" secret ingredient to their establishment and live up to their name--and I doubt that the food is actually what NEEDS to change.\n\nSave your money--find something else to spend $10 on."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2012-10-14 19:17:18", "review_text": "I am on a 30 day juice fast and I was visiting Santa Barbara. I havent had alot of juice outside my home but, when I found Epic Bowl all my problems were over. I had the Superfood Drink and it is amazing. The people that worked there were so helpful and they even gave me the recipe for the drink. Very nice. Please follow me as I juice for another 8 days. Ive lost 25 pounds and I feel amazing.\n \nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Juicing-for-a-change/276098682501394"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2012-10-02 22:33:12", "review_text": "No stars! Bought a Groupon for this place. Have literally tried to go 5 times and it is ALWAYS closed. The hours on this yelp page are wrong. I went yesterday and the guy said they closed at 4pm, even though his door was still open. Not even interested in trying the food at this point."}]}
