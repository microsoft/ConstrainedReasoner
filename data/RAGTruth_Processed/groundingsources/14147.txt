The bowls are my favorite, and I adore anything with pineapple. It's good value, and I'm happy with the modest portions when I just need a quick lunch instead of leftovers for days. One evening, delivery to my apartment was so quick that I almost didn't answer the door. \n\nBut the quality of the food varies greatly. I've had rice plates with tender beef, and rice plates with gummy sauce. I would go elsewhere for poke bowls and tacos. Hiwi excels at nourishing, vegetable-forward bowls -- brighter and more complex than Hana Kitchen. Seek those, and you'll have a guaranteed happy lunch."}]}
