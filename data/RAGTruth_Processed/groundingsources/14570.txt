We called up and asked about putting an order in for pick up. We go through all that and I let them know that will be using the Axxess Card finally. They said sorry you have to eat inside. I said we cannot somebody has a compromised system and they are not supposed to be eating indoors at this time given him COVID omicron.   Due to the weather the patio is closed. The manager said they would not make any exception. Even though they can see in the record buck we have been coming here a lot.\n\nI think I even asked about the Axxess and the waiter  didn't know what I was talking about. But bottom line is do you want to work with your customers who are long time supporters or do you say to them well sorry you have to take the risk and eat inside or else we won't honor it. It doesn't make any sense. I'm waiting for the general manager to call me back because Ernesto the manager said well basically ignore your doctors orders and eat inside it if you want the Axxess - we won't make an exception. He didn't put it in those words but I said that's exactly what his messaging is relaying.  The merchants  should spell it out more clearly. Otherwise again we're talking about inaccurate  advertising."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-27 16:37:09", "review_text": "Positives: Great ambience, beautiful architecture inside, nicely decorated for Christmas, delicious (not outstanding) Pizzas, good soup;\nNegatives: burnt flat bread, bad appetizer (\"Carrot\") with over cooked veggies and Baba Ghanoush that tasted nothing like a real Baba Ghanoush, and an arrogant server (Phillip) that was too full of himself!!"}]}
