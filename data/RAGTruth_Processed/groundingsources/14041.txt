My wish finally came true. Anyone who's been here knows the quality of seafood is locally sourced and always fresh. I mainly come for the warm lobster roll, which is served on buttery toasted bread. \n\nIn my honest opinion the lobster rolls here are the best in town! There's no competition compared to this one. \n\nI'm glad the location is shared with the Shaker Mill and Modern Times. It gives you a chance to grab a cocktail or beer from either place. There's plenty of seating inside and outdoors. \n\nI've pretty much covered everything I love about this place in my review for the Malibu location, but I had to represent the 805 of course!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 17:50:33", "review_text": "So wonderful to have Chris and his Seafood Crew back in Santa Barbara. And great location too.\n\nComfortably wedged on lower State Street in the old Cubaneo space, and right in between Shaker Mill and Modern Times. So nice to have the option of sitting in the outdoor patio space with your seafood and beer. Very fun and very dog-friendly. \n\nChris and BSOC have brought back their delicious Lobster Toll, Clam Strips, Oysters on the half shell, and other tasty treats.\n\nCan't wait to share this delicious space with friends and family."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 17:20:21", "review_text": "I'm so glad to see Broad Street open an official spot in SB. I remember visiting his booth at Muni wine a few years ago, and I knew he'd be doing big things. Next thing I know, he's got a hot spot in Malibu. The lobster roll is a must, but don't skip out on the burger! We had the fried shrimp too, and boy were those plump, sweet and juicy!"}]}
