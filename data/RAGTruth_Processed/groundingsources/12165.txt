{"question": "forces can be measured in what unit? how much force does the apple apply?", "passages": "passage 1:For example, when you push open a door you have to apply a force to the door. You also have to apply a force to pull open a drawer. You cannot see a force but often you can see what it does. Forces can change the speed of something, the direction it is moving in or its shape.\n\npassage 2:The unit of force is the Newton (N), and a force of 1 N is defined as the force that when applied to an object with a mass of 1 kg, produces an acceleration of 1 m/s 2. If we apply a force equal to 2 N, the corresponding acceleration is 2 m/s 2.\n\npassage 3:When the force is applied for a given time (1 second) in a given direction, at the end of that time the mass will have a velocity (1 meter per second) in that direction, relative to the initial velocity of the mass.\n\n"}
