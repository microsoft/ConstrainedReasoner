From the time I was seated til I left the SERVICE was rude and the FOOD was mediocre at best.  \nI ordered the dinner combo including appetizer, soup and entree.  Egg roll was greasy and won ton soup had no flavor.\nThe meal came with rice.  Not making the choice myself, I was brought FRIED RICE.  This was white rice with added soy sauce and tiny bits of scrambled egg.  Again, no flavor.  I asked to have plain white rice instead because THIS WAS NOT FRIED RICE especially when I saw a plate of fried rice go past my table that you could clearly see had egg, onion, peas.  When I commented that this fried rice looked nothing like that fried rice I was told \"this is the fried rice that comes with the combo\".  The plain rice came and was very starchy and smelled like a wet washcloth!  If you know anything about cooking rice, you know it should be washed first before cooking.\n\nBut here's what else I noticed... as an AMERICAN BORN CHINESE there is a discriminate atmosphere here.  I was seated on the left side of the restaurant.  As several CHINESE BORN couples arrived they were seated on the right hand side, given different menus (most restaurants have this type of menu for customers wanting real authentic Chinese food instead of the American classics but not everyone gets it) and given ivory chopsticks instead of wood sticks from paper wrappers!  The whole dynamic of service was different to watch as well.\n\nWhen I mentioned my observation about the two sides to the waiter he said \" yeah, okay\" so he didn't even deny the differences!\n\nAll customers should receive the same quality of service as well as same quality of food whether it be the regular entree or combo and whether your born in China or America!\n\nThis place is the worst!\n\nAnd from the response they gave Charlie M a month ago, they don't care about their actions\n\nIf I could I would give this place a ZERO STAR RATING"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-16 06:23:58", "review_text": "First impression: no host. A waitress came rushing over, showed us to a table, gave us menus, and disappeared. In a few minutes, a waiter appeared, asked us what we wanted to drink and were we ready to order? When we asked him for a few more minutes, he disappeared. About 10 minutes later, a waitress came over, brought water and place settings, and took our orders, which included - Note: EGG DROP SOUP WITH BEAN CURD. \n\nThen a few minutes later, the waiter came back and asked if we were ready to order!\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, the same waiter came rushing over, plopped a bowl of soup with the ladle onto our table, and said, \"Here's your egg drop soup,\" and rushed away. We have ALWAYS been served our soup at a Chinese restaurant! \n\nAfter we'd been eating the soup for about 3 minutes, it dawned on us that there was no bean curd in it. We flagged down the waitress and told her. She said, \"There's no egg drop soup with bean curd anymore. We took it off the menu.\" When we told her it was on our menu, she said \"No it's not; look\" - and she pointed to the menu under the glass on the table, which, indeed, had only egg drop soup. We repeated that it's on the printed menu, and she should have told us it was no longer available when we ordered it. She walked away.\n\nMoving on: while we were still unhappily eating our soup, the moo shu appeared, already rolled, two plates, two rolls each. No lovely demonstration of rolling them at the table. Again, I've never seen this at a Chinese restaurant. Moments later, out came our two main courses, and then the rice, and then we were abandoned. And we were still eating our soup.\n\nWe gave up on the soup (which was really egg drop soup with cornstarch), and moved on to the moo shu chicken. It was lukewarm, and it actually hadn't been there that long. It tasted good, but it was hard to enjoy it at that temperature. \n\nOf course, by the time we got to the main courses, they were no longer hot. Amazingly, the brown rice, in its lidded wooden container, was steaming hot! It was the best part of the meal. \n\nOne of the main courses was Filet of Fish with Black Bean Sauce. There was almost no fish - it was mostly deep-fat-fried flour. I have had this dish many times and the fish has never been fried. I could eat almost none of it. \n\nIn summary: the moo shu was good, although cold; the rice was good; and, btw, the tea was good ($2 extra - is this usual now?).\n\nThey have lost two customers and have gained a severely negative recommendation that will get passed on to many of our friends."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-12 04:55:29", "review_text": "Foods are okay.
