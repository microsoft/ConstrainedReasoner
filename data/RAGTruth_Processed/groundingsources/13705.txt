Hostess who seated us seemed irritated with us, and did not present herself well \n2. Waiter was OK, but not much warmth here either though\n3. Jambalaya was good\n4. Seafood Gumbo didn't do down well, but this was my first time having this dish, so maybe it was me...\n5. Cornbread was OK\n6. Andoullie Sausage on the side was good\n\nI would not return to this location."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-03 23:16:15", "review_text": "Hooray for beignets! We devoured our warm fried pillows of deliciousness under a blanket of powdered sugar and maple syrup. Traditional and sweet. Followed by delectable fluffy biscuits and gravy with eggs, some of the best gravy around, and that's coming from a gravy snob. Large portions, great prices, and service was friendly and fast. Brunch was a bona fide success! Other offerings include chilequiles and jambalaya.  You can't go wrong with Cajun Kitchen. Yum yum in the tum tum."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-22 03:12:45", "review_text": "Great food, good service, fair ambiance. Love the tritip Benedict.
