Don't head over there cause now that location is closed. worst part is, when you have a craving for a PBnJ burger and the biz is run into the ground.. there isn't anywhere else to go. DISAPPOINTING!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2016-12-26 17:30:03", "review_text": "Cool place in the funk zone. Very good beer selection, haven't tried the food yet. Service was pretty good, really like the vibe of the place.  Will be back."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-11-12 01:46:39", "review_text": "Food was ehh. It took forever to get, when I got it the burger had no flavor at all. Salad looked like it came out of a bag. I ordered a beer and it was warm and flat. Last time I'm ever coming here. Place does have some potential though it's nicely decorated."}]}
