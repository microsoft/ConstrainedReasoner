Brings back memories of when I was a child. This location in particular has really improved since I've been going. The last time I went the service was really good and the food was on point. They also are open a little later for us working professionals looking for a quick substantial meal Side note: they gave everyone a free bowl"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-04 22:37:45", "review_text": "We decided to go to Panda Express for lunch today since we haven't gone in a long time, the restaurant was very nicely set up and clean, a long with a very friendly staff, although the portions we got were not even at all. I got probably 20% chicken 80% rice! Which is not a big deal, but the real tipping point was I received orange chicken instead teriyaki chicken even thought it was clearly written down on the box, and my cream cheese Rangoons weren't cooked properly. I would surely hope that this was just a mistake and not a regular deal. Overall the food was very tasty, I will say, just some bumps in the road.  Although I will say, we did get 5 fortune cookies instead of just two was great, except the nonexistent utensils was... not so great."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-16 02:33:53", "review_text": "The slowest place in town my god it takes about 1/2 hour to a hour to finish checkout"}]}
