{"question": "how are figs", "passages": "passage 1:An introduction to figs. Figs are the fruit of the ficus tree, which is part of the mulberry family (Moraceae). Figs have a unique, sweet taste, soft and chewy texture and are littered with slightly crunchy, edible seeds. Fresh figs are delicate and perishable, so are often dried to preserve.\n\npassage 2:Although considered a fruit, the fig is actually a flower that is inverted into itself. The seeds are drupes, or the real fruit. Figs are the only fruit to fully ripen and semi-dry on the tree. For many years the fig has been used as a coffee substitute. The fruit contains a proteolytic enzyme that is considered as an aid to digestion and is used by the pharmaceutical industry.\n\npassage 3:Figs contribute a variety of nutrients that promote good health. Figs, one of the oldest fruits known, are native to the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.
