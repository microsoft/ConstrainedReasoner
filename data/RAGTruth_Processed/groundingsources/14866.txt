I really enjoyed the beautiful patio with views of the golf course. The food took a bit longer to come out than expected but we had a party of 8 so I can understand that it's difficult to time everything right. Everyone was really happy with their food. The entrees come with a choice of salad or fries and all of us tried the fries which were the highlight.  The ahi wrap was tasty and fresh. Great dining experience, scenic spot to bring out of town guests."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2019-06-01 01:49:43", "review_text": "Came for a late lunch and was hoping to get flat iron steak, but the kitchen was closed by the time I got there. No worries, I asked if the wings were fried and was told they were, and are delicious, so I ordered them.  When they came out, they appear to be baked or microwaved because it didnt have any crunch to it at all, and the wings were in the smaller side. My friend ordered the Reuben sammy and said it was just ok. To me it looked like a grilled cheese sammy with barely any meat inside. I've been here plenty of times (mainly for golf, in which the links are great) but maybe today, was not a good day for the kitchen. The scenery is nice, and seating outside has a good view of the course and pond. I will be back, and still want to try the flat iron steak."}]}
