Governor Abbott Wins Court Ruling on Detaining Immigrants
Texas Governor Greg Abbott passed an executive order two years ago that has been held up in court. This month, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a district court ruling preventing state police and Department of Public Safety from stopping any vehicle carrying illegal immigrants.
The federal government and a nonprofit challenged Governor Abbott’s law saying it was unlawful.
The three-panel judge panel from New Orleans ruled 2-1 the law was legal according to The Guardian.
According to Courthouse News Service, Oldham wrote for the majority:
“GA-37 expressly tasks someone other than the governor with its enforcement. As we have said, where the challenged law ‘makes clear that [another agency] is the agency responsible for the [law’s] administration and enforcement,’ only that agency is a proper defendant under Ex parte Young.”
He also added:
“[E]ven assuming the governor has directed DPS to pull over plaintiffs via this executive order, that instruction is in the past. DPS alone will enforce the order in the future.”
Hear what Governor Abbott said two years ago on the executive order:
This is good news for Governor Abbott who continues to send migrants to sanctuary cities as they overwhelm border cities such as El Paso, Del Rio, Brownsville, and other cities.
