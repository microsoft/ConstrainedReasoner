Also, I don't exactly enjoy hanging out in a bar that's sandwiched between a strip club and an adult book store either. The food is good but overpriced and the drinks are expensive and inconsistent. And what's with the rock hard chairs? The only reason I frequented this establishment is because they claimed to be a gay bar otherwise the quality vs. value quotient just doesn't cut it. The new Pub is doing a disservice to the Legendary \"Pub\" that was it's predecessor in the same location!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2012-08-23 21:59:28", "review_text": "This was, very briefly, Santa Barbara's only gay bar. The last time we went, we could tell that they had new owners and everything had changed.\n\nThe new people behind the bar were nice, we were served in reasonable time, the bar was very quiet and it felt like as if it were just really slow business. Really sad actually, I had high hopes for this place."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2012-06-25 23:55:16", "review_text": "This place is just okay. Ordered a scotch \"neat\" and the young bartender had no clue what I meant. I explained it, then he began to condescend to me that drinking that sounds nasty to him...scowling at me the entire time. Wow. Nice move to demean the customer!\n\nIt's fine to hang out with a group of friends, but don't get your hopes up. Pretty bland establishment in my opinion...and I love low-key. This is not low-key, it's no-key, if you get my drift."}]}
