It. Is. Amazing. \n\nI had recently heard about this place as it's one of the few restaurants in the area that has a Michelin star. I wanted to go there for my birthday but it was booked up. But lucky for me, there was an opening for an anniversary dinner for me and my hubby the following week. \n\nWe arrived outside 15 mins before our reservation, as they requested, and bumped into one of the sushi chefs (though we didn't know it at the time). He saw us poking our heads around looking confused so he asked if we were there for a sushi reservation. We said yes and he graciously walked us into the hotel lobby and pointed out the guy we were supposed to check in with.\n\nAfter we checked in with the host, he brought out cute little sake cups and dishes for our complimentary beverage. It was so refreshing and delicious. The host also wished us a happy anniversary, which I thought was so nice. We waited in the area for about 15 mins waiting for the rest of the diners to show up and once everyone did, we were all guided into the quaint little sushi bar.\n\nThey have assigned seating once you get inside. Every seat has the guest's name written on a blackboard slab. I was so pleased to see they sat me and my husband front and center in front of the head chef, it was truly a treat! \n\nNow, I've only had omakase one other time before this time (at Yoichi's, which I was unfortunately not impressed with) so I'm not super experienced with the whole omakase culinary experience. BUT every piece of food I had there was just phenomenal. For drinks, we did the house pairing with our food. It was fun to do once but certainly wouldn't do it again as it was quite pricey and not sure it made a huge difference to the overall experience of our food.\n\nI'm generally not a nigiri or sashimi type of sushi eater. I'll admit it, I generally like sushi rolls with cooked fish, I know that's like blasphemy but most places where I've had a huge hunk of raw fish, the texture of the cold chewy fish sloshing around in my mouth just really grosses me out. I say this because I think it means even more coming from someone like me that their raw fish is just so top notch. Some pieces were so soft and fresh it just melted in my mouth. I'm getting hungry just thinking back on it now. There's been very few places where the meal was so good that I go back in my mind and fantasize about it. That's what photos are for and I normally do take pictures but chose not to this time because it felt a little rude. So I guess I'll just have to relive this experience through my mind only, and trust me, I often do. \n\nI can't wait for future special occasions to come up again so I can come back here. It was quite a pricey meal but trust me, it's worth every penny!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 06:25:02", "review_text": "My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try since we heard it has one Michelin star. Reservation is $25 deposit per person and the omakase is $145 which consists of 17 courses including dessert.\n\nWe arrived on time even though it is recommended to arrive 15 minutes ahead of time. We still end up having to wait for about 10 minutes in the lobby of the Montecito Inn. The hostess asked us if we wanted drinks while we were waiting.\n\nThere were no chopsticks. Everyone ate their food with their hands and there was a hot towel to clean your hands. The food was delicious except the rice was a bit mushy. Fish was high quality and fresh. I didn't drink, but everyone else were drinking. As someone here has mentioned, I also felt that their goal was to get people drunk. In the end, the chef asked if anyone wants to try the wagyu or any of the previous nigiris again. \n\nOverall, the service was great but expect to pay about $200 per person."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 23:31:19", "review_text": "My partner and I ate at this restaurant a few months ago and were disappointed. While the food was okay, the service was very poor, and members of the staff shouted the drinks options to patrons. Additionally, the chef made some very crude remarks. It did not feel like a Montecito experience and rather something rough-and-tumble in Los Angeles. Based on my experience and the high price tag ($500 for two people), I would not recommend it."}]}
