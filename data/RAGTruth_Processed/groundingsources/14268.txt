Today, I ordered a classic Kyle's burger (super well done, no pink) and super crispy fries. After waiting 40 min while it was prepared to go, the burger was pink on the inside and the fries were floppy/greasy. Really terrible food today. Also, the girl working at the counter, and putting all the food together had her mask beneath her nose.  I love Kyles, but sorry to say this was not a good experience."}]}
