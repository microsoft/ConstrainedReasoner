I ordered a \"special\" over the phone for pick. The deal was $7.99 for a large 3 topping pizza (including hand tossed). When I arrived for pick up, they had upped the price by a few dollars! I was told it was because of more than 3 toppings. When I pointed out that there were 2 toppings covering the entire pizza, and then a split where it was 1/2 of one topping and another 1/2 of a different topping still equals 3 toppings. She had to get the manager. The manager then told me it was because I had ordered 1/2 side with Anchovies (trying to eat \"better\" ). I said that should have been disclosed when I ordered. I walked... they did not hold up to their end of the bargain and did not inform me of the increase of price on the phone! I would have been ok if I knew ahead of time of the extra charge, or would have ordered different toppings. Or the manager could have just taken care of the fact her employee did not clarify the charges when I ordered. She didn't - NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. Haven't been there in a LONG time - Most likely it'll be months to a year before I try again! Wow!"}]}
