They serve delicious beers, have a mellow vibe, and the service is great. We've been here on the weekend a couple times and they serve delicious Smashburgers as well. Prices are reasonable. \n\nThey are located in \"The Mill\", which also has a wine spot and restaurant. Great family spot for some beer drinking. Check it out."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-26 17:54:53", "review_text": "Great selection of beers and love the location. I don't love beer but they had a few I could chose from plus the municipal wine is next door for you wine lovers like me. We heard the burgers were amazing but they only serve them some days. Might want to call as they have pop up cuisine on different days. Great Vibes and drinks!"}]}
