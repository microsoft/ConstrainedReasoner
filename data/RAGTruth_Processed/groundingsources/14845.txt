Their food is insanely good (my favorites so far are the crawfish pasta and the chocolate souffl\u00e9). The customer service is super nice. On my boyfriends birthday we came here because we couldn't find any restaurant that was open late at night, and the server Mondo saw us and helped us out. They were closing the kitchen but they reopened it for us and made us dinner. I love this place and I love Mondo. Thank you!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 03:05:33", "review_text": "The food was delicious and the service was great! I had the crawfish ettouffee and my husband had the shrimp and crawfish pasta. We are half and switched plates so that we could enjoy both meals. They were rich and filling and satisfied the palette. Our kid had butter pasta and he ate it all. We ended with the Louisiana Bread Pudding. It was a delightful Creole experience in California."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-08 00:13:47", "review_text": "Cajun is not my favorite but, all the same the food is good.
