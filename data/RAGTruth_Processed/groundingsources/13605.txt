There's a 35 dollar holding amount on pen tabs ( mine was 6 dollars at the end) that holds for 2 to 3 days. Something you'd think should be explained at the start of opening a tab. Especially if it's not busy. When called and asked about this mysterious 35 dollar charge it was met with a question of \"the bartender didn't tell you about it? \" Remembering my last visit to this place recalling there was no explication of 35 dollars being held. Further explication of why there is a 35 dollar hold was said \"if someone can't pay their tab or leave before paying,  blah blah blah.\" I stopped caring. Was recommended to pay and close as I go or bring cash when drinking there. Unfortunately I will not be returning. Sorry you have less than great customers that cause you to HAVE to take 35 dollars out. Perhaps we evaluate. Good bye Uptown."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-24 15:26:28", "review_text": "I attended a friend's birthday party at the Uptown and was so impressed with the staff, food and surroundings.\n\nSeriously loved the whole experience.
