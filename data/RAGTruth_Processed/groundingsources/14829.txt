The kids can be a bit picky about chicken, but they gobbled this Mesquite BBQ. They both put the chicken on the included flour tortillas with some Spanish rice, pinto beans, and pico. The tri-tip burrito was great; well stacked and very flavorful. \u00a0After a couple days of vacationing in SB with expensive but mediocre food, this place was awesome. \u00a0Would definitely come again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-15 00:27:53", "review_text": "Love this place! Just found this week and have gone twice. Their burritos are delish, shredded chicken is fresh and amazing! Well priced and well worth the trip!!!"}]}
