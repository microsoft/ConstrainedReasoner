It's a very nice Spanish tapas restaurant with and outdoor patio and lots of fireplaces and heaters to keep guests warm at night. We ordered the el bulli, baya de oro and datil as small bites to start off the night. My favorite was the datil and the el bulli was an interesting citrus caviar but I didn't think it was mind blowing. Don't skip out on the Jamon tasting and manchego! The jamon tasting is perfect for 2 people and comes with plenty of meat (iberico, Serrano, and chorizo and pan con tomate). The manchego tasting plate was amazing and came with the best accompaniments! The almonds were out of this world and was cooked with a lavender type glaze on them which paired well with the cheese. Also, try the pulpo and churros to round off your meal. The pulpo was super tender and crisp and the churros were plenty to share. I even got to take the leftovers home for snacking later. Don't get the patatas bravas! I thought it was going to be more like a hash brown from previous photos but we got more smashed potatoes covered in like a hot mayo sauce! Definitely could have skipped on that one. Overall, it's a great dinner spot and was enjoyable on a Sunday night out."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-16 06:02:30", "review_text": "Was a nice atmosphere. Appreciated the outdoor dining and they are very thoughtful about having ample heaters to make sure diners are warm. \n\nStaff was nice. \n\nFood was slightly disappointing:\n\nEl bulli: felt like simple tangerine pulp with a micro basil leaf\nCrudo: seafood is my jam and brininess is delish but the fish in this Crudo tasted fishy and felt like a coarse hunk of fish that wasn't cured at all in acid\nPollo paella: wasn't bad but wasn't something to write home about\nChurros: batter seemed very good but was burned with burnt flavor\nBasque cheesecake: delicious! Light and not too sweet"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-13 03:51:35", "review_text": "This place has the best food! I thought I knew a good paella until I came here. A bit on the pricey side but well worth it. We shared it with some sangria. The sangria was perfect, but too sweet or too tart. The service was quick and simple. We'd definitely come back here the next time we're in the area."}]}
