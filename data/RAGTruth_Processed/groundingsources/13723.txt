I thought I ordered delivery, but after an hour they called and said I ordered pickup.  I am disabled and unable to do pickup, and upset with this.  Also, a few items  I ordered were not included.  \nWas also surprised by corned beef item. They had options for peppers, mushrooms, and Louisiana hot sausage, which I thought would be extras on the side. Turned out they were blended in, and result was the amount of corned beef was almost undetectable. \nWhat was included was good- but inconvenience, surprise at what extras mean, and missing items were disappointing."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-03-18 18:50:03", "review_text": "Regarding delivery,\n\nI placed my order on their website, which has the option for delivery, around 10:15 today. When I hadn't heard anything by 11:10 or so I called to ask. The girl who picked up said the food was ready and she didn't know why it was still in the restaurant and she was going to figure out who would be doing delivery. Received a call back 5 minutes later only for her to tell me her manager said the delivery driver was out for 1 month and I would need to come to get it or he could offer a refund. \n\nThey've done this to me once before, months ago when I yet again ordered delivery from their online site. They used the same excuse. I guess I didn't learn. \n\nWhat made me so upset was the fact if I had not called, the food was goIng to keep sitting there....and it wasn't until I took the initiative to call that they informed me they didn't have a driver, OVER AN HOUR after I placed the order. If you're running a business, especially during times when individuals are trying their best to socially distance, you should keep your website updated if you have no delivery option. And also improve in your customer communication! \n\nThis experience left a sour taste in my mouth and makes me never want to come back to dine in or take out."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-03-15 19:02:46", "review_text": "Great coffee is always a plus to a good breakfast.\n\n\n\nMy youngest daughter had the French toast with the no till and bananas absolutely head she tried to finish all the plane without any luck of completing task.
