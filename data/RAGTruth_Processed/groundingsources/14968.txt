I could not believe she has never been to Jills!!!  She was born and raised in Santa Barbara!  She said she was not that hungry but ended up eating the entire chicken sandwich, and couldnt stop talking about how much she enjoyed her dinner.  The waiter and server were so nice and funny too.  I love coming for their breakfast burritos too."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-24 09:23:42", "review_text": "Wonderful waiter, food was FANTASTIC.
