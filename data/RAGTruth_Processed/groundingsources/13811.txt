'Big Brother 25' Spoilers: Felica Tells Jag That Matt Wants To Target Him In The Double Eviction
Big Brother 25 (BB25) spoilers tease that Felica Cannon works to bring Jag Bains into her corner with the double eviction just around the corner. Big Brother Network reports that Felica chats with Jag in the Head of Household room, revealing Matt Klotz could be planning to target him in the double eviction.
Felica wants to make it to the final three. She knows she must make some big moves and create chaos to get in that position. The only way she knows to accomplish this is to create a wedge between Jag and Matt.
Big Brother 25 spoilers say that Felica tells Jag that Matt had a conversation with Cirie Fields, stating he was considering targeting him during the double eviction. Matt supposedly said that he worries he cannot beat Jag in the competitions and final two.
Joker Updates reports that the bombshell shocked Jag. He couldn't believe his ride or die, Matt, would throw him under the bus. Jag isn't sure he can trust Cirie either, now that he knows she was on board for Matt targeting him in the double eviction.
Jag is considering keeping Blue Kim to have someone in his corner. Blue's game is as good as dead, but Jag considers asking everyone to keep her over America Lopez, to use her to put Matt and Cirie on the block.
Big Brother 25 spoilers say Felica is putting her game on the line. Once Cirie and Matt learn that she exposed their plan to Jag, she will have a massive target on her back going into the double eviction.
