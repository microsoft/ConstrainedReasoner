He claimed that they don't honor Axxess deals but when we called Axxess, they've confirmed that they have a contract with Mesa Burger for 2022 and that they should have honored it. He was very annoyed with me when I showed him the Axxess deal saying that because of Axxess they lost money last year. But I paid $40 for an Axxess card so I feel that I've been lied by both Axxess and the restaurant. Never going back there."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-04 05:21:49", "review_text": "I really liked the burger I had here. Quality food and no complaints.
