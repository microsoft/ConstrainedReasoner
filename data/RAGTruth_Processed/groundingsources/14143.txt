And for the price, what a steal! I love that it's non-pretentious and makes smoothies accessible to everyone. It's great that you get a free supplement (we went for immunity boost, you know, for covid) added to your drink. Some are definitely way healthier than others, so beware when you order. \n\nRed Mango - 5/5 Yummy! Really loved this as a fruity, refreshing drink. \nDate - 3/5 I would just get something else. It didn't taste of dates at all - just like a plain ol' sweet milkshake."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 19:14:41", "review_text": "Whether you're completing a morning workout or finishing up finals week, getting a smoothie is the perfect way to celebrate no matter the occasion!\n\nJamba doesn't have a large presence in Santa Barbara, which I quickly found out soon after moving here for undergrad. Instead, there's a local chain when it comes to blended drinks... and it's a hundred times better.\n\nYou have the option of customizing your own smoothie or choosing from their pre-set menu. Most of their blends are a mix of fruits, juice, and sherbet/yogurt/ice milk.\n\nEvery drink comes with one free supplement. You can add chia seeds, probiotic, calcium, antioxidants, etc.\n\nPre-COVID, I loved their reusable cups and how they would give a small discount for bringing it in.\n\nMy all time favorite has to be Blue Banana, which is a creamy concoction of milk, blueberries, banana, and \"ice milk\". Great consistency, decently sweet, and super refreshing.\n\nPeanut Butter is a close second, which is an indulging blend of chocolate, peanut butter, milk, banana. It's super sweet, basically a milkshake.\n\nI don't know if they still use ice cream to make their creamy smoothies, but that's probably why it's super delicious. Drink responsibility and in moderation.\n\nHappy New Year!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-15 18:08:04", "review_text": "Green smoothie with chia was so energizing that it's my \"go to\" snack. I bought 3 and redistributed them into 5 home containers. Mental clarity, energy and ... other benefits if green. Very reasonably priced and worth the drive."}]}
