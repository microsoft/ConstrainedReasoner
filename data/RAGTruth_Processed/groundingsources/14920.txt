It's a quick walk from any of the rooms if you're staying at the Coast Village inn.\n\nThe outdoor patio is stunning with the most picturesque lights and gorgeous trees. Even though we were outside, the heaters kept us warm and we felt comfortable the entire time.\n\nHands down the best part of our meal was our cocktails. The endless summer drink was to die for.\n\nI also highly recommend the pear and arugula flatbread, though we enjoyed everything we ate! \n\nI don't typically eat a lot of vegan cuisine but we loved this place and we're already planning another visit."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-06 00:13:23", "review_text": "Oliver's is great! I've been finding myself in a couple of vegan spots lately and I'm not vegan by any stretch of the imagination. I'm one of those who will not dare consume an animal product in my coffee drinks, like could not pay me any amount of money in the world to drink cows milk - but will devour an entire block of cheese a couple hours later.\n\nI eat what I want, when I want but my sister is Vegan and I'm totally not opposed to others living that life. I bake a bunch of vegan items and I really do love a lot of vegan options but the commitment to an entire lifestyle isn't right for me.\n\nI'd asked my bestie if we could grab dinner at Oliver's on our way home the other night. We usually eat brekke at Jeannine's or grab coffee and pastries in Montecito on our way out to wine tasting in Los Olivos but we are never quite in need for dinner on the return because we've either already eaten a bit sooner than we hit Coast Village Rd. or I've way overdid it on McConnell's froyo stop a couple exits before here.\n\nEither way, I knew I wanted to grab dinner so I intentionally asked the gal at McConnell's to only give me half of my froyo order because I needed to fit in dinner tonight.\n\nMy bestie is definitely not vegan so I didn't mention to him this restaurant was and as it got closer to dinner, I simply suggested this spot might be \"vegetarian\" I didn't want to totally scare him off of the idea.\n\nWe'd eaten a late lunch and ordered a few plates to share which was plenty!\n\nWe shared the Apple Salad, Kung Pao Cauliflower and Spinach & Artichoke Flatbread.\n\nAll three dishes were very yummy. We both really enjoyed the salad, but agreed that the Spinach & Artichoke flatbread was our fav. It was super filling and would be a great share for a larger dining party.\n\nAs much as I wanted to try dessert and under normal circumstances would have totally tried to do dessert (my froyo) before and dessert after dinner, my dessert stomach was already full and we had to table that one for our next visit.\n\nService was great, the salad came out quickly and the other dishes seemed to take a bit longer but it was a Sunday evening and we had no place else in the world to be so it didn't matter much.\n\nWe'll definitely return in the future. This is a great option if you are staying in the area or passing through and want a really scrumptious meal in a nice calm atmosphere.\n\nIt was a chilly night and as lovely as the patio was I wanted to cozy up in a corner booth and keep warm indoors. The patio seems perfect for warmer evenings.\n\nPlenty of street parking out front."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 22:17:10", "review_text": "Oliver's is such a cute restaurant! \nWe were very pleased with the entire experience. \nThe staff was amazing-  attentive and friendly. \nThe outdoor ambiance is beautiful with outdoor lighting and fire pits that creates an intimate setting. There were plenty of heat lamps around to keep you warm. There is also indoor seating too! \n\nFor dinner we had the artichoke flatbread, tomato salad, and jackfruit tacos... they were all very tasty! Oliver's is also family friendly, they had high chairs for children. They also offered pasta or cheese pizza for children to eat. \n\nI would definitely come back to Oliver's again. It's a great place for a nice dinner as a couple, family, or even a date night with drinks at the bar. Aesthetically, the bar was incredibly chic. I loved it. To note: parking is on the street from what I am aware, not in the actual plaza as it is saved for hotel guests there."}]}
