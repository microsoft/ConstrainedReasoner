None of the employees need to wear masks and the one I spoke to shared that he was not vaccinated. He told me he had had COVID and wasn't afraid of COVID. I am. I've had friends die of this disease. I have friends who work in hospitals and witness the toll it has taken. There is less danger of transmission when people wear masks, so why won't this business take this step to look out doe its customers?"}]}
