Their sandwich menu is very simple, yet delicious. The restaurant is very clean, the service is superb and even though there's always a line, they move really fast. \n\nI always get the super deluxe and their bread is always fresh and all the meats and veggies are on point. Their portions are \"just right.\" \n\nTino's also has a large variety of Italian goods and other hard to find goodies. \n\nThis place is a \"weekly\" must if you live near by."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-22 03:02:27", "review_text": "Absolutely the best sandwiches in Santa Barbara and you can't beat the price they're regular sandwiches are so filling and so good and I went in there today an hour after they closed not knowing that they weren't open and they still even made sandwiches for me today."}]}
