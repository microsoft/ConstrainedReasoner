The place is too small a crowded for the workers. The food prep stations are ALWAYS messy and gross and there's a lot of cross contaminating. Food takes forevor even when there's no one there. The workers are so unwelcoming and often distracted when taking your order. The food taste like nothing which is crazy cause so many reviews are hyping up the flavor but I literally can't taste much other than the sauce they drench their sandwiches with. South Coast Deli is the way to go."}]}
