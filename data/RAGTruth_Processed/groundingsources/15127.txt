{"question": "how to heat frozen baked scones", "passages": "passage 1:There should be little bits of cold butter scattered around the flour. The moment the cold butter pieces bake, they create little pockets of steam and cause the dough to rise \u2013 this is similar to what happens when you bake pie crust. It\u2019s the butter that makes these cranberry scones so tender, light and delicious.\n\npassage 2:Scones should be light and flaky, not heavy and flat. We stick to all-purpose flour in our kitchen \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much our go-to flour. For this recipe, we prefer to use soft, low protein all-purpose flour. Protein levels vary by flour brand. Protein content can affect the tenderness of baked goods.\n\npassage 3:Make sure to preheat the oven to the correct temperature (220\u00b0C / 200\u00b0C fan oven / gas mark 6) before putting your scones in. The 15 minute guideline starts from the point at which you put your scones in a preheated oven. It may also take a bit longer to bake them through in a standard (non-fan) or gas oven. You will also need to extend the time if you\u2019re baking more than 12 tea-time or 24 canap\u00e9 scones in the oven at the same time.\n\n"}
