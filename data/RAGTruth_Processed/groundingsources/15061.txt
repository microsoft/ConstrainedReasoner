I'm all about paying a premium for a great cup of coffee... but this place is just an overpriced Dunkin' Donuts. Ambiance is drab, coffee is drab... and they charge 20% more for a non-dairy milk. Even the \"corporate\" Starbucks is ending the extra charge on plant based milks.\n\nThey're all about the aesthetic of being \"Santa Barbara, and environmentally friendly\"... but they're just greenwashing Luddite's. Get with the times - stop charging for plant based milks and invest in some cool attire. Caje is such a better local coffee shop group in the SB area"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-03 21:54:05", "review_text": "I visit Dune several times a week, and I think the only complaint I can think of is that there are no outlets. Besides that, everything is perfect. \n\nThe coffee is excellent - I've tried cappuccinos, matcha, iced lattes, and hot lattes and they're all really wonderful. The quality of alternative milks is really good (they use Califia Farms) and the espresso is always strong and flavorful. I absolutely love their matcha -- I believe it's Mizuba and when you order it with honey and cinnamon it's delightful.\n\nI've also tried the croissants and the toasts and they're all super yummy. The cinnamon sugar one is probably my favorite.\n\nThe baristas here are some of the kindest people I have ever met. They are so genuine and warm, and I love seeing them when I order.\n\nThere is plenty of seating, always great music, WiFi, and just a really relaxing and cozy vibe."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-10-02 21:32:09", "review_text": "I stopped by dune coffee roasters while I was waiting for my clothes to dry at the laundromat. The service was good and quick as there were not too many people when I went. They have a cute little outdoor patio with tables and a good amount of seating inside. I ordered a iced vanilla latte. It tasted good and refreshing, however, I wish it tasted a little sweeter and more vanilla."}]}
