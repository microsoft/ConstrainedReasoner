People must be out of their minds (not surprising near UCSB). I heard great things about the \"old Rincon\", but whatever they have done recently has definitely dropped the food quality. This is the most average Mexican food I've had in awhile - that stuff we ate in the '80s at Chi Chi's and Pepe's because we didn't know better and didn't have options. You have options!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-10-08 02:35:35", "review_text": "Best Mexican food there is by the UC!  Wait staff and hostess are the bomb and so fun and polite.

Sat in the patio which was nice and really enjoyed the mariachi which comes though and plays throughout the restaurant. Will definitely be coming back, especially when the mariachi is here. Great touch..."}]}
