They have an incredible selection of wines from all over the world, including a large number of spectacular local wines. Whenever we buy wine for our own enjoyment, for our events or for client gifts, this is our go-to spot.  They also have a great wine club and during COVID have been doing virtual wine tasting events which have been a lot of fun and a blessing on the Santa Barbara community during this challenging time. Thank you Vino Divino!"}]}
