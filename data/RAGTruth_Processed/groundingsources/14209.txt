The portions were small, the service was sub-par and the atmosphere was noisey.  \n\nI wouldn't reccomed this resturant as there are many great resturants in Santa Barbara to choose from.  Pass on this one..it's Not worth the time."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2011-08-15 03:38:42", "review_text": "My husband & I went there on our honeymoon,, not sure of what to exspect, but when we walked in & we told them we just got married we were treated like celebrities. We just celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary & wanted to go back & eat there again & to my surprise it waws closed.. SO Bumbed..  Funny because we had talked about going back that very night.. I think we will visit again anyway, but again.. TOO BAD Keven I loved that restaurant.. Best food best service best dining experience ever."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2010-04-21 06:05:36", "review_text": "Epiphany used to be our weekly spot. Meredith and Nick were the best! Their focaccia burger with bleu cheese was as naughty as they come. I was sad to see things had changed to Hob Nob on my last visit but the experience was just about as fun and lively--without the awesome bar tenders we were used to. I'll be back though. Their new menu looks tasty."}]}
