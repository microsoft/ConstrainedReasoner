Hadn't been to a La Salsa in FOREVER, so this was a good plan (or so I thought).  I walked in and it was pretty busy, but by the time I placed my order it had cleared out.  I decided to get a Kids' Meal Quesadilla with black beans.\n\nAll in all things were fine with my meal; it was served hot so good so far.  (The only reason this review isn't 1 STAR is because their Mango Salsa.)  My soda tasted good, the chips were fine enough.  I began to eat my meal as I was sitting in one of the booths near the front door.\n\nAnother employee comes to the front door (near me) and starts spraying Windex and begins to clean the window.  I DO NOT want WINDEX in my food!  Then, she gets a broom and starts to sweep (no lie).  Then, gets out her mop and bucket and MOPS THE FLOOR.\n\nThis place is pretty small, so I could have given them a pass if she had mopped on the other side of the store, or oh, I DON'T KNOW WHEN THERE WERE NOT ANY CUSTOMERS around!?\n\nPretty gross.  Then, to top it off the employees started to BLAST the music so loud I didn't finish my basic queso.  \n\nNah, skip this place."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-08-05 22:37:00", "review_text": "One of the FAVES to stop and eat when driving through Santa Barbara.

Great location off the 101/154\n7.  It's consistent!\n\nSo, definitely try it out.  Ignore the naysayers.\nTry the Mexico City tacos!\nTry the nachos.
