Not only did they reach out to me after I had left my bad experience, but they went the extra mile of taking care of my next meal with a personal apology and explanation of how they corrected the person whom I had the bad experience with. I will continue my usual Friday lunches here knowing I'm cared for. Thank you Kerry B. for reaching out and the manager at the establishment for personally talking with me and sorting it out."}]}
