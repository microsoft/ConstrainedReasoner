Tonight was finally the night we were going to order it! I ordered through GrubHub - I got the 2 meats/1 side deal with 2 orders of brisket, Mac and cheese, and added a side of the potato salad with bacon, and the beans with bacon. That also comes with white bread, pickles, and their \"famous BBQ sauce\". Overall, it was a little pricey but IF it's good I am willing to pay it. \n\nSo, I am really bummed out to report that I was really disappointed by the food. I wanted to like it so much I thought for sure this would be my new go-to BBQ place! But, one of the biggest things was they didn't give me any of their \"famous BBQ sauce\" and that's really what felt like was missing from the brisket. \n\nThe sides were ok. I thought the Mac and cheese was a little dry/bland but with a little salt and pepper on it, it helped. I thought the potato salad with bacon was pretty good but needed something acidic to break down all the starchiness. The beans with bacon was good - probably my favorite side of the 3.\nI'd be willing to give it another try in the future WITH their BBQ sauce though, so don't totally count me out!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-09-27 04:52:17", "review_text": "Loved our family feast! Thank you for bringing the joy of smoked meats and carefully crafted sides to our Saturday night. Awesome brisket and mac and cheese. Glad we decided to make the last minute addition of corn and black bean salad. Amazing customer service.  Thank you Tim's crew! We'll be ordering again."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-09-25 02:53:03", "review_text": "One of the good things about having grown up nephews and nieces: people of whom i have had a good amount of contact and influence on when they were growing up: adults now who drive, think, analyze, care about you (as in me) is that i can ask them to drive me somewhere, get me something at various and sundry places and as in last week: order, pay for and pick up a meal. To be fair i warned them when they were kids: your uncle is going to expect to be paid back for all the driving, picking up, leaving off, etc., etc., i did for you. So NOW is that time.\nBut for now i am relishing the well earned attention. And i'm only 1/2 kidding here in any event.\nSeveral weeks ago my niece told me about Neighbor Tim's both as a food truck and a stand alone BBQ joint.\nI zipped into SB and asked her to bring some BBQ for me, her kids and hubby as well as for my sisters. She raved about this place. So i thought: ok, sounds good: so bring me some, please.\nWell bring me some she did:\nPork ribs\nBrisket\nPotato Salad\nMac and cheese\nWhite Bread thick sliced\nSauce: Amazing Sauce it is called\nBurnt Ends (from another time but reviewed here)\nThe ribs were perfectly cooked and meaty. I am a purist when it comes to ribs. they must be tender and juicy but not falling off the bone meaning i pick one up and the meat falls off. That is too well cooked, usually cooked with too much moisture and not enough heat or smoke.\nThese ribs though were well smoked, well seasoned (not too salty) and were delivered w/o sauce which is the way i prefer them so that you can taste the meat and not just the sauce. The sauce btw is super also: vinegary, light on the sugars with a snappy chili finish: north carolina style which surprised me only because i thought this was a Texas style BBQ joint. But it works so why fight it. \nThe Brisket was also well seasoned and smoked as well as very moist and tender. No knife needed to cut and we made sammys using the white bread and dipping in the sauce to finish.\nThe Mac and cheese is nothing special: just cheese sauce and noodles. This needed salt and pepper for starters. \nThe potato salad was a big letdown also: the dressing was good and in the right proportion: neither too much or not enough but again salt and pepper would have helped and acid is needed desperately. Pickles, mustard, maybe or both?  Also most damning is that the potatoes were slightly undercooked. in other words too al dente for my taste. \nThick white bread was in the Texas toast style and it was real tasty: reminded me of a traditional pullman loaf. Yeasty, high quality bread not Wonder Bread, remember?\nThe burnt ends were not part of this order but we had these about 4 weeks ago and they were absolutely first rate: charred, and well seasoned to within an inch of their lives. Tim's are made from the deckle of the brisket i am going to assume and are super tasty chunks of beefy goodness. Next day you can thinly slice and use in a taco or sammy or just to pop in your mouth while pretending to grab a beer from the refer.\nAll in all a very good sampling today of Neighbor Tim's wares:  what they do well they do very, very well. I will be back!"}]}
