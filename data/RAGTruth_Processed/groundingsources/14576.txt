Great way to start off the year with a tasty chorizo breakfast burrito. Got added beans in ours. Also would have been great if it had diced onions and peppers of some sort and/or cilantro (or maybe those at the bar more to add ourselves). Really good burrito that I would eat again. Not 5/5 stars because it wasn't incredibly amazing."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-01 01:37:56", "review_text": "Tough call for best Mexican food on Milpas, but I think Buen Gusto takes it."}]}
