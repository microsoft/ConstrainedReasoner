Every time they make something for their Specials menu, I wish they would add it to the main menu because it's THAT good -- Portobello taco, Guaco taco.  \n\nTheir vegan Tres Leches Cake should be called the No Tres Leches because it uses 3 different types of coconut oil instead and it's to die for.  I buy a slice every time.\n\nI think these guys really capture the savory element of Mexican food and it's all vegan!\n\nA super underrated business in town with heart. Don't miss out on this train."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2018-06-07 21:48:28", "review_text": "The staff is unapproachable and the food lacks flavor. \nAlthough their ingredients are creative? I think the way everything comes together tastes like cardboard.\nSerious waste of money.\n\nI gave my feedback to the staff and they laugh at me. Awesome feeling being laughed at for suggesting how to improve your food.\n\nI wish I could give a negative review, because this place is so bad.\n\nDefinitely NOT a Santa Barbara vibe"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2018-06-05 23:48:40", "review_text": "Taco Tuyo is pretty good! I'm not vegan myself but my roommate is, so I always go to the newest vegan places in town with her. The jackfruit nachos were our favorite thing we got! They were full of flavor and were loaded to the top full of all the toppings. We loved that they were semi spicy with lots of the vegan cheese melted on top. :)\n\nWe got the portobello tamale which we both liked. We loved the corn and kale that the tamale had in it along with the salsa that was on top.  \n\nWe loved the salsa so much so we asked for an extra salsa on the side, that we added on top of everything!\n\nWe also got the taco cuete, which we both weren't that big of a fan of because we didn't like the sauce on it. \n\nOverall I will go back to this place again to try something new like the burrito or the ceviche! The people who worked there were friendly and very helpful in helping us pick out what to get. \n\nEven if you aren't vegan you will like this place because it's full of flavor and spice! Check it out if your looking for a healthy plant based mexican meal."}]}
