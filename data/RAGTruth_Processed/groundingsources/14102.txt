We arranged bottle service with Matt Moore and everything went so smooth, he was very attentive. They checked on us throughout the night and made sure we had all we needed. The music was amazing! They had a mix of everything and also took mine and my 7 girls' song requests all night too. The staff here was truly excellent from the bar tenders, to the bouncers to the DJ. There was a good amount of people when we arrived at 10:00pm but around 11pm a lot of the crowd left and it wasn't too full anymore. This didn't bother us at all because well there were 8 of us and we all kept each other pretty entertained. Me and my girls seriously had one of our best nights here at M8RX and I would highly recommend this night club to anyone looking to laugh and dance the night away!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2018-05-09 22:08:52", "review_text": "I really like the interior and all the different floors and I really wanted to like this place. However, the times I've been here I always end up leaving early. The dance floor just isn't poppin'. Then when I finally stayed long enough to see the guest DJ, they turned up the music waaaaay too loud. I've been to Basspod at EDC, I think this place is louder than that. It was uncomfortably loud so we left the place right away."}]}
