It was raining really hard outside so my only option was to Uber Eat some thing to my hotel room. The fajitas had a lot of flavor and was a pretty big portion. The rice was cooked very well, the only thing that could've used more flavor was the side of beans.  I forgot was to ask for utensils so make sure to ask if you're getting delivery . I ordered a shrimp fajitas with a side order of steak, total was about 38 with the delivery fees. Would order again"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-28 02:56:24", "review_text": "Absolutely terrible pickup experience. My husband placed the order and I went to pick it up. When I arrived they said they had no order. Then they said they found the order, handed me a bag and charged me $72. I looked in the bag and found three items that we didn't order. Then She said oh no the order actually wasn't placed. Oh okay, so you were going to give me random food I didn't order? Replaced the order in person and waited 20 min. Horrible experience."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-27 20:27:10", "review_text": "It was raining and we were looking for a warm meal. Staff was extremely friendly as we ordered at the counter. My husband and I spilt the chicken fajitas and it was perfect with a side of beans and rice. Tortillas seemed handmade and the salsas were delicious. Hibiscus margarita was fantastic!!"}]}
