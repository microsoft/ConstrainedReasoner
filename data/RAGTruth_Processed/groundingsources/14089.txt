This one was a bit....interesting.\n\nYou know how you hear about combining things that don't seem like they'd go together, like apples and cheese, or back before peanut butter 'n jelly was a thing-- peanut butter 'n jelly? Well, the Veggie Ramen was like that, except the ramen items, (in my opinion), did not go together at all-- dried cranberries? pumpkin seeds? My taste buds were a little more welcoming to the Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and arugula, but they weren't super excited. \n\nOverall, I didn't really like my meal, however, on a positive note--\n1) I appreciate that Santa Barbara Craft Ramen took a chance on a bold Veggie Ramen recipe -- you never know 'til you try! Maybe they'll fine tune it and dis-invite some of the current friends to the Veggie Ramen party (i.e. dried cranberry and pumpkin seed) and invite some new ones (perhaps mushroom, maybe corn?) \n2) Our server was really great\n3) Good location, right in mix of things on State Street"}]}
