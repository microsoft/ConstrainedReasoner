{"question": "what is the difference between a family dr. and a primary care dr.", "passages": "passage 1:A Primary Care Physician (PCP) is the primary physician that YOU use for health care. Some people have internists, or other doctors, as their primary care physicians. A Family Practice doctor is one who is more of a generalist and usually treats virtually every age group from newborns/pediatrics to the aged.\n\npassage 2:Gynecologists are trained to focus on women's health issues. Primary care doctors (also sometimes called general practitioners) are the doctors we see for regular checkups and immunizations, and when we're not feeling well. Family medicine doctors, internists, and pediatricians are all primary care doctors.\n\npassage 3:Practice Philosophy. Family practice physicians focus on meeting the needs of the entire family. The family doctor is uniquely trained to care for the whole person throughout his or her life, from birth to old age. Family doctors often receive training outside of general medicine in the areas of pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and geriatrics.\n\n"}
