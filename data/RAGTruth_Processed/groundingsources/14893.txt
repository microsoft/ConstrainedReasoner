Too bad as we love this course and come every year.  That is the bad news, the good news, is the head professional, Josh Pollaro arranged to get us on Sand piper and it was perfect.  He was so professional, understood that we wanted to play  all 18 holes at Rancho so he  came up with a great idea , for us to play Sandpiper and he called to arrange a tee time asap so we had time to drive over and they got us right on. THANKS Josh, we will be back in October and thanks for being so kind, accommodating  and thinking of a great solution.   See you in October!!! We love Rancho San Marcos"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-06-19 13:45:33", "review_text": "Great day yesterday \nStaff was very accommodating and friendly \nCourse was great fun.\nVery challenging for part time golfer like me but nonetheless had a great time"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-05-09 23:32:19", "review_text": "My wife and I another couple played here 10 days ago. The course is in the best shape in years. A challenging course and well worth it. We need to play it more often then we do. The only negative is that there are no course Marshall's and at times the play can getting a little slow. I am not a fan of 5 hour rounds."}]}
