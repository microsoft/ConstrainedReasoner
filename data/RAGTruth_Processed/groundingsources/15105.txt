{"question": "how often do you exercise", "passages": "passage 1:Aerobic Exercise. The CDC suggests that adults get at least two hours and 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week, or one hour and 15 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. This breaks down to about 30 minutes of exercise per day for at least five days per week. While two hours and 30 minutes of exercise may seem like a lot of time, it's fine to break up your physical activity into more manageable chunks of time, such as three sets of 10-minute intervals during the day. This makes meeting your aerobic exercise requirements easier.\n\npassage 2:Put a day of complete rest or light cardio in between each weight training workout, and you\u2019ll make good gains. When training for size, look to increase your total weekly volume. In this case, our muscles have a \u201cquota\u201d they need to hit weekly so that they each receive a sufficient amount of training to promote growth.\n\npassage 3:Maximize your fitness output. To obtain maximum benefits, increase the length of time that you work out. Gradually try to challenge yourself to extend the period of your workout sessions. For example, if you began your fitness routine walking for 20 minutes a day, after three or four weeks try 25 minutes. Once that becomes too easy try 30 minutes. This means to work harder! To benefit from this principle you must understand your current fitness level.\n\n"}
