The food and service here is absolutely amazing.

Bland pizza.  It was warm and done on time for pickup.  We ordered pepperoni and mushroom, and pesto with chicken and artichoke hearts. I don't think it's any better than Rusty's, which I know a lot of people like (I don't).  I wish there were a Round Table nearby, but there isn't as of this writing.  Betitna's in Montecito has the best pizza around (even better than Round Table).  Worth the drive.  My sister went in to pick the pizzas up and said the staff seemed uncaring and remote. Although they were standing right there, my sister had to announce that she was waiting on 3 pizzas and they didn't really seem like they wanted to help her."}]}
