They have an extensive menu, and the best time to go for the best prices would be happy hour, between 3 - 6pm. The food is relatively clean if you order something grilled. The service is a tad slow, because the servers are overworked and busy. I appreciate the hand sanitizer on every table, and along the corridor. They take germs and the pandemic seriously here. I like their wine and alcohol list, and it's a peaceful spot for conversation. Because the restaurant looks quaint, sits up on a hill away from the sidewalk and busy street, and there's little tables in different little spots, it feels kind of romantic. I would come here again for a peaceful and easy afternoon."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-08 06:47:47", "review_text": "I have had two very enjoyable dining experiences at this caf\u00e9.  It seems to be the restaurant I always go to when I go up to Santa Barbara for a concert. Both times I was seated reasonably quickly (One time solo dining and the other with a group of friends). The service was quite good both times - which was particularly remarkable on my most recent visit because it was during a very busy Saturday night service. Even though it was busy, it wasn't super loud, IMO. The outdoor seating patio area is very nice and on this most recent visit I sat inside and the atmosphere was very pleasant (and all staff were masked and I felt perfectly fine in that regard).  Most importantly the food is YUM *and* they have several vegetarian friendly options.  I look forward to my next visit."}]}
