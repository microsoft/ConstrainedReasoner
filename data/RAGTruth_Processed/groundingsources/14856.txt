The mixologists are genius, and have great off menu suggestions (like a vodka shot with muddled fresh strawberries). The food is very fresh and locally sourced. Over three days (we stayed at the adjacent Hotel Indigo) we had the mussels in madras curry broth (amazing), the pork chop with polenta, the heirloom tomato salad, and the focaccia. We also had the goat cheese frittata for breakfast and almond brioche.\nThe place has a hip crowd and modern decor."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2016-01-03 23:28:33", "review_text": "My husband and I had the opportunity to try this place out the day before New Year's Eve. We decided to stop by and sit at the bar as we were exploring the area. \n\nFirst and foremost, they have the best cocktails. The bartender was amazing and was able to hold down the fort despite a fully packed bar and restaurant. I had the bartender's special made with Vodka. It was combination of spicy and sour. My second drink was the What The French Toast. This drink was garnished with a Cinnamon Toast Crunch and tasted like the best liquid cinnamon roll I have ever had. The bartender is truly a mixologist!\n\nWe had the Wood Fired Focaccia. This was crispy on the outside and nice and doughie/fluffy on the inside. It also had a little spicy kick to it. It was truly tasty. \n\nThe only reason this place did not receive 5 stars is because we ordered the mussels and the crab risotto and we were informed that they were out of ingredients for both dishes. That was a complete let down as the focaccia and drinks left us wanting more."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-01-03 05:55:15", "review_text": "This is a must see!  It is an absolute gem to the community and the food couldn't get any better in my opinion!"}]}
