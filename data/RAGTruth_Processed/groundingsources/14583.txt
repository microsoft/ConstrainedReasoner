No explanation. No call. No note... just canceled. My friend and I were hungry and thought we would be eating in any minute and instead we found ourselves placing another food order with a different restaurant that was able to get the job done. Never had any issues with the other Public Market eateries, which is probably why you guys seem to be the least busy ones there."}]}
