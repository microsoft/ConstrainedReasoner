We NEVER saw a waiter and sat in the covered area for over 45 minutes.  Tables to the left of us and tables to the right of us were waited on... Although one of them had to ask for service numerous times.  They even mentioned that we were waiting for service.  I finally went to the bar to get my drinks myself... 16 bucks for a screwdriver (with no vodka really), a heiniken and a coke. Don't waste your time or money.  Definitely won't last if it doesn't improve.  Hopefully next years dog show will have something better in place."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2011-06-20 16:00:50", "review_text": "Place looks ridden hard and the food is well, meh."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2011-06-17 16:15:16", "review_text": "Overcooked....not real woodys food..they only served wings as an appetizer and they were 7 to an order for $8!...french fries should not have had the woodys name attached to them. over sauced the pulled pork sandwich..probably to cover up the taste..was gonna get a drink but they said they were outa an ingredient.  this was my second time here so i was giving them a second chance."}]}
