UAW Targets CEO Pay During Strike
Since September, the UAW has been striking against the big three Michigan car companies, Ford, GM, and Stellantis.
The United Auto Workers are asking for better pay and more benefits.
A number of workers have walked off the job across several states. Contracts have been offered and rejected. The president and former president have visited the striking workers.
Now, the UAW has another target in their quest to win the media war.
CEO pay.
The car companies’ executives have huge compensation packages. Shawn Fawn, the UAW, said that their salaries have outpaced the workers’ wages.
Fain took to YouTube to explain his point, “They’re absolutely rolling in the money. They’re competing for who gets the biggest executive compensation package.”
According to Michigan Advance, the big three CEOs all made over $20 million. “General Motors CEO Mary Barra’s compensation is $29 million, the highest of the big three automakers, followed by Stellantis’ Carlo Tevares at $25 million and Ford’s Jim Farley at $21 million.”
Fain has been bringing up the executive officers’ salaries because they have risen by 40% since 2019 when the last contract was done. However, the auto workers' wages have only risen 6% during the same period.
Cindy Schipani, a business law professor at the University of Michigan explained how this hurts the companies during negotiations. “The union seems to be arguing an equity issue, especially in light of the sacrifices the workers needed to make in past negotiations,” she said. “Of course, the CEO’s job isn’t comparable to the job of the average worker, but I suspect the UAW may believe it has some leverage. If the company can afford to raise the salary of the top executive at roughly 40% over 4 years, why not also grant the rank and file similar increases.”
