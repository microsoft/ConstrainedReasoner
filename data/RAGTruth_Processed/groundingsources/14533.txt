The seafood is excellent, the spinach ravioli is excellent, as is the salad and bread. Good service and good wine recommendations.

Mollie is a caring and gifted chef.  If you are not eating here you are definitely missing out!  Favorites: spinach soup it is amazing and you will not find this soup (the way she makes it anywhere else!), pasta with crabmeat served on the shell, (a special dish served on occasions maybe you will be one of the lucky ones to try) the strawberry, arugula and parmigiano cheese salad, the grilled branzino and the turkey meatballs!!! So happy she reopened in Santa Barbara from her Montecito location!"}]}
