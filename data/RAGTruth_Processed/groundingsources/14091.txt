Unfortunately for us, Laura (the hostess) was there to make it even more difficult. From the minute we started speaking to her she was unpleasant and dismissive. Our server (did not get her name) was very pleasant and offered to move us to the patio where it would be warmer. Our 2 year old started to fuss a bit, and Laura took it upon herself to let us know we would need to\nmove our stroller if she needed to sit someone next to us (there were several tables available... starting to see why). Less than a minute later, she sat the very next couple right next to us, as I was trying to wrangle my 2 year old. (Once again, plenty of tables). It was clear she did so to make us uncomfortable, and it worked. We decided to take our business elsewhere. It is really unfortunate since I've had so many pleasant experiences here, which I why I wanted to take my family. I can confidently say we will not be back."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-21 04:04:05", "review_text": "We have enjoyed pascucci's for so many years now and just went tonight. It's always wonderful. I usually get the Bellagio pasta, but tonight got the ravioli sampler, in the mood to try each one. So good. Not sure which one was my favorite, had to keep tasting. We sat outside in a covered patio with a lovely warm heater. The garlic bread is such a treat. Such generous portions, went home with a great lunch for tomorrow. If I don't raid the fridge tonite...."}]}
