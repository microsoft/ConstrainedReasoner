The shrimp tempura one was my favorite with shrimp you could really sink your teeth into.\n\nand although there are many takes on a classic dish such as fried rice, Secret Bao's refresh with their pork belly fried rice, kim chi and furikake was a fresh welcomed rendition. great flavors and even a subtle texture with that dry fried rice.\n\nmy kids also couldn't get enough of their well-seasoned and crisp KFC. and we finished it off with some donut baos complete with strawberry ice cream and condensed milk.\n\nthere were so many other entrees we wanted to try but unfortunately our stomachs were too full from grabbing a snack beforehand.  though fortunately, that means there will be a next time! so next trip to Santa Barbara, we'll be coming for that udon carbonara and kalbi bossam! \n\na lovely restaurant overall and customer service also A+. thanks to Kathleen and their gracious hostess who topped off the already great experience!\n--"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 06:17:24", "review_text": "This place is insanely delicious. I don't often write reviews, but I'm a huge fan! Their fried rice was good, but next time I'm only getting the baos. We tried the pork belly bao, shrimp tempura bao, and the Korean fried chicken bao. They were all different and equally delicious! I highly recommend this place."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 05:41:19", "review_text": "Not sure why this place has the reviews it has but the food was just alright. The flavors taste weird together. Id recommend them to add more sauce on the side, especially cus the bun is so thick and the protein filling is larger than the bun. It was a hard meal to get through. 2 stars though because the Duck Confit special was pretty good!"}]}
