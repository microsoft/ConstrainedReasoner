If there are twelve people in line; be patient. \nDo NOT be rude and ruin everyone else's day.\nWe will be back again and again and again.\n  Three of us ate at this Taco Bell yesterday.

We had to throw out food due to long black hair mixed inside a burrito.  It's obvious their safety practices are non existent.   Just go around the corner to Los Arroyos.  Go anywhere else for that matter.  It's disgusting."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-06-15 17:33:35", "review_text": "This Taco Bell is something else. The workers are passive aggressive. I asked if the order was mine and they responded with \"They've been calling some name out so it must be yours\" with attitude but I didn't want to take some order if I didn't know what the bag contained. I also ordered a drink and that bag didn't have one so.. When I asked for my orange juice I held out my left hand and the guy purposely handed it on the opposite side like he was messing with me. I didn't appreciate this as it was early in the morning. They also passive aggressively told my friends the restroom code when asked and didn't give their drinks with their order as well."}]}
