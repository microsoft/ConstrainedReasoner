{"question": "how the blood travels through the heart", "passages": "passage 1:Pathway of blood through the heart. 1. Blood enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the coronary sinus. 2. From right atrium, it goes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle. 3. From the right ventricle, it goes through the pulmonary semilunar valves to. the pulmonary trunk. 4. From the pulmonary trunk it moves into the right and left pulmonary. arteries to the lungs. 5. From the lungs, oxygenated blood is returned to the heart through the. pulmonary veins.\n\npassage 2:Blood enters the heart through two large veins, the inferior and superior vena cava, emptying oxygen-poor blood from the body into the right atrium of the heart. As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your right atrium into your right ventricle through the open tricuspid valve.\n\npassage 3:Student will learn the circulatory system's role and purpose. Student will examine anatomy of the heart and the blood vessels. Student will recognize differences and function of arteries versus veins. Student will learn the circuit and travel of blood throughout the circulatory system.\n\n"}
