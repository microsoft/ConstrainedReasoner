This alone would make me want to come back! The green salsa is surprisingly creamy yet still hot. I'm still thinking about the chips as I write this post. \n\nThe tacos de camaron were amazing as well. The shrimp included in the tacos were almost the size of my palm!! They were very generous with the amount of shrimp per taco too. The rice was alright--definitely not the highlight of the show but did it's job.\n\nThe taquitos de pato en mole coloradito was (duck taquitos with mole) was definitely interesting. The duck was shredded and fried into taquitos, and the mole was slightly bitter. I'm glad we were able to try this but I'm not sure if we'll reorder again.\n\nThe esquites Mexicanos was delicious. The corn was perfectly seasoned with cojita cheese and sour cream. Definitely the fanciest esquites I've had. \n\nOverall a great experience! The food was satisfying and the service was friendly. I'd recommend coming while the sun is about to set so you can enjoy your meal with a beautiful view."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-15 00:42:54", "review_text": "What a beautiful restaurant and the food was beyond amazing!

This is a great place to meet friends, bring family and for date nights! \n\n I love that the location is near the water and has both beautiful indoor and outdoor seating! They have an extensive drink menu with SO MANY margarita choices and signature cocktails.\n\nWe started off with the Margarita Sauylita which was a tasty pineapple mango margarita and it came it with a cute pineapple glass and garnish. 10/10! My boyfriend got the Jamaica which was also good! I would love to go back and try more of their drinks because there are so many great options!\n\nAs we waited, they brought out chips and salsa. Now the green salsa served here was by FAR the greatest salsa I have ever had in my entire life. It was so creamy...I just need a bottle of that to go. \n\nAs for food, I had the Mole Negro con Pollo which the waiter said was one the customers favorites and it did not disappoint!!! The chicken and the rice was amazing, the mole was rich and creamy and the plantains were PERFECTLY ripe and sweet. I loved this dish so much.\n\nThe service was amazing as well, shout-out to Adrian! I need to come back here on my next visit to Santa Barbara!"}]}
