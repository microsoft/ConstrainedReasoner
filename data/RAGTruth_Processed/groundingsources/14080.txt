I was VERY specific in my delivery details, as my house is behind the main house on the property. I am unit A. About an hour later, my neighbor knocked on my door and was holding my pizza. He told me that he found it on his back porch. I was stunned, but, thankful that he found it. \n\nI took the pizza inside and when I opened the box, the pizza was cold (no surprise) and there was a piece missing. Yep, somebody had eaten a piece of it. I know it wasn't my neighbor, which means it was likely the driver (?), or maybe it was done at the pizza joint and he didn't check the box?? Either way, I was completely disgusted. We are in the middle of a pandemic and somebody touched/ate my food.  UGH. \n\nI called and spoke with a supervisor (Jonathan) and told him the story and told him that the pizza was on my front porch, as I refused to eat it and refused to order a replacement (I just didn't trust them not to mess with my food.) The driver came back and grabbed the pizza and I am supposed to be getting a refund. We'll see if that really happens. \n\nI will not order food from them again, which makes me sad. I have a 40+ year history of patronage at Rustys, but, this is not okay. Too bad."}]}
