Octopus was over-salted, but green salad was great. Lobster was good. \n\nIn their defense, perhaps, the waitress did apologize for how long our oysters took. She explained that the shucker was new and politely implied he didn't know what he was doing, which left me wondering why he was shucking oysters at a seafood restaurant. \n\nSome good things: the space is great, modern without being too formal or drab. Our waitress was obviously good, though challenged by a difficult kitchen and bar (one glass of wine was forgotten). \n\nOverall, this felt like a place with a lot of potential in need of better leadership in the kitchen."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-11-16 00:03:40", "review_text": "Knowing it was late for dinner, we checked ahead and made a reservation for 8 at 9:00 pm.  When we arrived, we were told the restaurant was closing but they would check with the chef and see if he wanted to stay.  We said we'd made a reservation and then we started hearing about what a busy weekend they'd had but they'd check on the reservation -- as we watched the chef leave through the front door.  Then we were told they were out of many items due to earlier business.\n\nSince we didn't get to eat, I can't comment on the food.  I later heard that the restaurant is under new management -- if this is true, I'd suggest some intensive staff training."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2016-11-11 01:42:10", "review_text": "Really not pleased with the visit tonight.
