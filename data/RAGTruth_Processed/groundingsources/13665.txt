Hallelujah - thanks for treat!!\nThe magic dissapeared... Also when we entered to reno room where you can not have any privace in the bathroom without door, with plastic outdoor shades inside (not protect lights from courtyard all nights) two towels for 3 people etc etc..list is not short...\n\nYes, it is still great location, cute hidden place with funky ideas, but the BASIC didn't work...\nI'll try to understand their business policy without contacting any kind of inspection...."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-09 18:17:14", "review_text": "ANTI-FORMULAIC well-designed hotel, it was originally an Art-School founded in 1920 and is now a small boutique hotel with only 24 rooms but oozing with charm. The attention to detail is amazing from the welcoming tiles in the parking garage to the pleasant smell of flowers when you get on the elevator.\n\nIt has a perfect low-key appeal and design that feels \"Santa Barbara\" without the artificiality of primarily using white stucco and orange tiled roofs to fit local vibe like some fancy hotels in the area. Very cool place to stay and we loved it. The rooms are eclectic but memorable and we enjoyed resting in some of the public areas like the fireplace and fountain. \n\nThe rooms have a GIANT bathtub for you to soak in and my wife was all chill and calm until she saw the shampoos, soap, and lotion were from \"Diptique\" and she went crazy texting her friends while I wondered why it felt slimy and made my eyes burn.\n\nLocation is tops, its easily walkable to some of the heavy-hitting sites and eateries in the Presido area, the longest we had to drive to anywhere else was 10 minutes."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-09 06:05:50", "review_text": "Everyone that works here is extremely helpful and  friendly. Super clean and beautiful. But the best thing of all is that they really make your stay special. We are currently staying here for my girlfriends birthday and they wrote her a birthday note with chocolates and rose petals on the floor and bed such an amazing place with even better staff"}]}
