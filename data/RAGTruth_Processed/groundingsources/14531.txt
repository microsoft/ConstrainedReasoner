From the front, it looks like an old school neighborhood-style bar - and that's exactly what it is behind the door. \n\nWhen I was here last night, my eyes were immediately drawn to the fun Christmas decor. There were lights, stockings, and a tree. There's a long bar, a front and back patio, a juke box and a pool table. The place is dark and divey which I loved. I also noticed that there was a Monday-Friday happy hour which went to 7pm. It's rare to see a happy hour end as late as The Tully's, let alone on a Friday, so I fully took advantage of the perk. \n\nOur bartender was very friendly and helped us with menu selections. I took advantage of ordering a $5 happy hour draught beer and enjoyed it on the front parklet patio. The music is pretty loud in the bar so the outdoor space was a nice place of solace. \n\nThis is a great spot with good service, and I will be back soon for sure."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-05-11 19:58:25", "review_text": "Came in for a drink while I was visiting the westside.

Can't wait until old school night!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-05-07 04:11:45", "review_text": "Alma's the best.
