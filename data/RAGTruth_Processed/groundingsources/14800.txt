The food was delicious and I personally really loved their pastry basket. I can't wait until it's safe to eat in restaurants again because this is definitely going to be one of the first places I go to! Their pastry case looked amazing and they had so many menu items that intrigued me!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-05-03 23:49:49", "review_text": "I hope this place opens soon.

They are always clean and the food is great!  They are quick and friendly.  Their cheeseburger is the best cheeseburger I've had in a long time!\nGrilled bun, super melty cheese and thick meat!  Good tomato and sauce is yum.  Love their chips and they make a Bloody Mary too.  There are days you need a bloody Mary to deal with the day.  Then walk back over to county bldg.  \n\nCafe always has nice staff.  I tip them well.  They make an amazing meal quick and what else can I ask for"}]}
