My wife had the Salmon and vegetables for 18.95 and the Salmon was over cooked and burnt. I argued with her to send it back , but it was close to their lunch closing time, so she resisted and suffered with it. My chicken Parm sandwich was overly cooked and dry. For a 40.00 lunch it was awful. We will not return."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-17 03:07:13", "review_text": "My boyfriend and I happened to stumble upon this place last minute for a dinner date.

My friend's husband picked up to go for my friend's birthday and it was so good! The meat lasagna was my favorite. I haven't been here for years, but this may prompt another visit in the near future! Everything was cooked perfectly."}]}
