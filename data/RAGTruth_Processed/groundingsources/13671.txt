Not anymore and they took my favorite item off the menu. Menu sucks now. But new owners don't care. That's why they will go out of business soon. Sorry but that's their choice.

We went there in February 2020 after it was purchased by new owners. In short, it should no longer be called the Paradise Cafe as it bears no resemblance to the original restaurant. The food was mediocre. We ordered a salad which came undressed, looked like it had been prepared by a child, and had no flavor and a tiny piece of salmon. It as listed as an entree but was more like an appetizer portion. Burgers, which used to be fabulous, now taste terrible, with poor quality meat and fries so bad my kids would not eat them. A fried chicken appetizer was unedible.  This used to be a fantastic restaurant, with genuinely good food and wonderful service, in a laid back atmosphere. They've kept the name and nothing else. The food now tastes like something you could get at a college cafeteria or out of a Cisco-supplied chain restaurant. What a loss for Santa Barbara."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-03-03 00:52:45", "review_text": "I loved the calamari appetizer! Super tasty and fun with a dip. Also the fried chicken was exceptional. The bar service was quick and Michelle took great care of us! Bloody Mary was on point. Definitely recommend!"}]}
