I'm found this place on a whim and so glad I did!\nGo here get the curry and make sure you're able to get a Thai iced tea!\n\nI love a pad thai, but so many places make them so heavy, this was crisp and bright flavored- so good."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-16 20:07:43", "review_text": "Ordered some Pad Woon Sen for takeout in my hotel room,  I must say, the PWS exceeded my expectations.  It was flavorful and a delight with every mouthful.   The glass noodles and vegetables had the  right amount of chew.  It was such a satisfying meal.  Thumbs up to the chef!"}]}
