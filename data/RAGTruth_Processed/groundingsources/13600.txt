The buckwheat flour they used destroyed all the subtle flavors of the crepe, the ingredients were WATERY, the lettuce tasted like it still was coated in pesticides and frankly, it was disgusting. Part way through forcing myself to finish what I had paid for, I literally gagged. I hope others have a better experience than I did!"}]}
