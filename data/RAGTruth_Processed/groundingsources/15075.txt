The carnitas is as good as the carnitas Rubio's used to have. At this point in my food journey, that's worth 5 stars. And it's not one of those half beans burritos. It does have some high quality beans, but also a small medley of well-seasoned veggie type ingredients. \n\nThere is also no need to even consider the jumbo unless you brought a wagon to wheel that thing home - and you probably want to eat it at home or Goleta Beach because there isn't any seating thanks to Covid. Even when the dining room was open, it never seemed like there were that many people in there. That said, the couple who runs the place is very nice, the prices are downright cheap, and if you haven't heard, they have a great carnitas burrito."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-06-22 21:19:23", "review_text": "I got the giant meat quesadilla and it was great! You can choose a kind of meat out of a big list with all the same price. Good combination of guac, sour cream and just a right amount of cheese. I will definitely come back and try other menu but I really liked the quesadilla that I would order it again with another choice of meat. Nice family restaurant with friendly people."}]}
