The warm piadini fits perfectly into your hand. Once you bite into it, you get all the layers of the reuben sandwich bursting into your mouth! The pastrami perfectly seasoned,  the sauerkraut with just the right amount of sour and tart, and the pickle, tomatoes, and thousand island dressing. And we can't forget that yummy Swiss cheese that's perfectly melted."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-05-20 20:54:58", "review_text": "Jeff (the owner) and his guys are the best...food is great too We work right next door and are lucky to have them as neighbors!"}]}
