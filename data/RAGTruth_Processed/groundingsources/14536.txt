Now they serve only to-go, so calling your order in is a good option - ready in ten minutes. Yesterday we had 2 burritos - Adobado and pork chile verde. Both were huge and very good, for $9.50 each. You have a choice of salsas to go with. We had the verde (fairly mind). The red sauce will make you sweat, which is what you want sometimes, with a cold beer."}]}
