But last night I ordered take-out of rad na (noodle dish) and what i got was a mostly-liquid, soggy, tasteless, mess. I wasn't expecting this soup. i doubt they would serve this atrocity inside the restaurant, but I won't be ordering take-out from them again."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-03 17:06:36", "review_text": "I usually skip on Thai food because of the excess grease, salts, and sugars. This Thai Cafe is different because the food is cleaner and freshly prepared, and you won't leave feeling sick, or feeling sick the next morning. I'm so impressed with their high quality, fresh, piping hot food, for a reasonable price. There are some outdoor tables for those who are distancing. I'm going to put this restaurant on my rotation of tried-and-true places from now on."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-27 03:30:47", "review_text": "Delicious family favorites -- pumpkin curry, Pad Thai, Tom Yum, Prik King and more!
