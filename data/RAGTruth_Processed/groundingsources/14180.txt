Now that they closed down, I wish I had taken advantage of their delicious-ness!  I loved every sandwich from them and of course on dutch crunch bread- MMMMM.  The bread was quite rough on the roof of my mouth, but that seriously did not matter to me one bit.  Try anything and everything if you ever encounter one of these, it's supposedly a Norcal chain??  You will know the distinct \"Mr. Pickles smell\" once it comes around to make your mouth water.  I was once on a train from UCSB to San Diego and knew someone, somewhere on the train had been teasing all the passengers with the breathtaking Mr. Pickles aroma while he or she was chowing down on undeniably fantastic sandwich!!!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2009-08-11 07:40:24", "review_text": "mr. pickles is so yummy! the portions are huge... and once again i discovered this jewel while visiting my cousin out in sb. its very plain when you first walk in and its ran by a bunch of college kids at ucsb.. but man can they make a meaty sandwhich! its nice because you can grab a sandwhich here and walk down the street and grab a pitcher of beer to go with it. i'd come here over and over again!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2009-05-27 03:45:52", "review_text": "When I lived in Isla Vista I absolutely LOVED going to Mr. Pickles for the Tuna Tuna. \n\nThe other weekend I was in town and was craving Mr. Pickles only to drive to IV and find out they are CLOSED!!!!!! They were no longer there. It was a total different sandwich shop. I was sooooo sad. \n\nI would love to open a franchise of my own in Huntington Beach. Wouldn't that be nice lol \n\nCan someone please tell how and why they closed? They were always busy busy when I lived in IV."}]}
