I would like to give this establishment 10 Stars. We arrived to meet an anticipated Sunday Brunch crowd. The magic begins here! As we waited under the sun blocking covering, we listened to great music over Bose speakers!!! We swayed and enjoyed the day. The owner, Chad, served us delightful muffins and thanked us for coming out then... Mark, the magician, gave us an AWESOME  show!!! Kiri, our waitress, was superior and this place was a WHOLE EXPERIENCE. The food is DELICIOUS!  Visit Chad's! You deserve the best!!!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-16 19:45:18", "review_text": "We had breakfast at Chad's this morning and it did not disappoint.
