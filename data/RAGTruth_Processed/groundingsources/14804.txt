The tasting menu is such value for money and the food is outstanding!  Edward, a young amazing chef!  We are foodies and the food blew us away.  The Black Cod was perfection.  The portion sizes perfect.  The Wagyu Beef Tartar superb.  Could not fault a single thing if I tried.  Superb!   We need to support chefs and staff like these to elevate what is sorely lacking in SB. A vibrant food scene!  Ours is lackluster at best\nWell done The Monarch!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2019-09-22 03:39:10", "review_text": "Sorry to report that this restaurant is struggling. I loved their extensive menu at opening but now it's limited, expensive, only open for dinner Wed-Sun and the reason for the 2 stars is that the wood-fired oven isn't vented properly so it's incredibly smoky. We went there on a holiday weekend when everything else in the hood had an hour wait and it was nearly empty and we had to leave immediately since we couldn't handle the smoke. We have stopped by numerous times but encountered the same lingering haze that would require your clothes (and lungs) to be fumigated after. We were regular customers of the formerly owned restaurant and cozy bar (which is now a rarely used sushi 'by appointment' restaurant) so are saddened that this prime spot is being underutilized. Hopefully they will find their way."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-08-16 00:33:51", "review_text": "Holy smokes. Monarch blew our minds - partly because we dropped in at 9:30 on a Wednesday night on our way up the coast (no expectations), but mostly because the flavor combinations were unexpected and meticulously crafted. Surprise, surprise - our impromptu road trip dinner turned out to be a Michelin-worthy artistic experience! Imaginative, delectable, layers of flavor, unique, pure magic. The kind of food you don't want to destroy with a utensil, but when you do, you just have to close your eyes and let the sensations wash over you. It's that good.\n\nThe following night (Thursday) beckoned to us with the promise of dinner at the Post Ranch Inn (the renowned Sierra Mar restaurant) where we planned to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday. Well no offense to Post Ranch, but Monarch outshined it in terms of culinary art. (Post Ranch was spectacular for the views, architecture, and experience - and the food was also very good - but at twice the price and half the flavor, held no candle to Monarch.)\n\nIf Monarch were in our area of Los Angeles, it would cost double the price and be booked out months in advance. In response to those reviewers complaining about price point, portions, and \"fanciness,\" please don't review all restaurants using a fixed scale. Would you complain about a Beethoven symphony because you wanted Spice Girls instead?\n\nMonarch = Beethoven."}]}
