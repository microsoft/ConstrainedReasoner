The priciest entrees are huge portions of food so really, they're quite reasonable, and there are some more affordable options as well.\n\nI have heard that they are considering closing their doors in the next couple months so GO THERE NOW while you still can!\n\nI could go on and on about this place.  The service is wonderful.  I highly recommend the Rouladen or Goulash (which comes with Spaetzle -- Germany's answer to mac n' cheese--- delicious).  I've heard that the various Schnitzel dishes are also extremely good.  Also, their darkest beer on tap is wunderbar.\n\nAll in all, I am heartbroken that they plan to close.  But I wish Veronika and Rudi all the best!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-01-23 03:21:15", "review_text": "Brummis-The German Taste is a simple place with a simple menu and the food is good with a truly Home-Cooked flair and flavor. Probably the best thing about Brummis-The German Taste is the service! The owner and server Veronika immediately makes you feel at home. My wife and I were vacationing in Santa Barbara for our anniversary and found Brummis. We liked it so much we went back on our anniversary and had dinner there. The first night we had gone to Brummis, they had run out of the dish that my wife wanted to try, So Veronika offered to make her something special, unheard of since we hadn't asked and yes the dish was Delicious! Brummis is a down home kind of place, nothing fancy but very comfortable. AT Brummis you get great service, a wonderful home-cooked meal and the price is perfect, just a great little place."}]}
