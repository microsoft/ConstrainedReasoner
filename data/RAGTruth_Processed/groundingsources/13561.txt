'The Young and the Restless' Spoilers: Kyle Addresses Audra's Relationship With Tucker
The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers reveal that Kyle Abbott (Michael Mealor) finally addressed Audra Charles' (Zuleyka Silver) relationship with Tucker McCall (Trevor St. John). She's playing a good game of pogo between both guys.
Weeks ago, fans saw Audra back in Tucker's bed. The two consoled each other over their ruined reputations. They also came up with an idea to take over Jabot. Tucker encouraged Audra to seduce Kyle to motivate him to get the co-CEO role.
Audra knows two things: 1) how to mix business with pleasure and 2) how to charm men with her good looks. On the Wednesday, October 25 episode of Y&R, Kyle talked about Audra's relationship with Tucker. She confirmed that they slept together.
The Young and the Restless spoilers reveal that the trio is in a three-way relationship. The user Arckangel asked on the SoapCentral.com Message Boards: "Is it officially a ménage à trois? Now that Kyle knows that Audra is sleeping with Tucker and that Tucker knows that Audra is sleeping with Kyle, is it officially a ménage à trois?"
One fan responded: "LOL!!! it is official to me that it is, and very disgusting I might add!"
Another user argued: "Just playing devil's advocate here.... Kyle's father, Jack, was a certifiable playboy back in the day, so this isn't much of a stretch for Kyle."
Y&R fans are already disgusted with Sally Spectra's (Courtney Hope) relationship with Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow) and Adam Newman (Mark Grossman). That love triangle has been going on for about a year now. Sally can't get her head straight about which man she loves more.
What do you think? Do you think Audra is having a tryst with both Kyle and Tucker? Sound off below in the comment section.
