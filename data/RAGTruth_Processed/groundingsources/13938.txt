The Louisiana Poter Accused Of Kissing The Wrong Woman Mysteriously Disappeared On July 12, 1964
Vanished Without a Trace: The Mysterious Case of Joseph Edwards
In the small town of Vidalia, Louisiana, the enigmatic disappearance of 25-year-old Joseph Edwards continues to haunt the community, even decades later. Edwards, a porter at the notorious Shamrock Motel, a known gathering spot for Ku Klux Klan members, vanished under mysterious circumstances on the night of July 12, 1964.
Edwards, who drove to work that evening in his 1958 blue and beige Buick, became the center of a controversial incident when a white woman, Iona Perry, accused him of kissing her. Perry, involved with a married man named James Buford Goss, a probation officer, confided in Goss about the incident. Goss assured Perry he would handle the situation with Edwards himself.
On that fateful evening, Edwards' cousin, Carl, along with three of his friends, found themselves subjected to violence, detained and beaten at the Ferriday Jail. The group later claimed that two deputies, both affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan, transported them to the Vidalia Parish Jail. During the journey, they stumbled upon Edwards’ deserted vehicle. Carl recounted a chilling warning from one of the deputies, stating that they would learn a harsh lesson and meet a fate similar to Edwards.
The discovery of Edwards’ abandoned car behind a bowling alley on the Ferriday-Vidalia Highway only deepened the mystery. Inside, investigators found a necktie fashioned into a noose, hanging on the steering wheel, a grim and ominous symbol.
The investigation revealed seven individuals potentially implicated in Edwards’ disappearance. Among them were Raleigh Jackson “Red” Glover, Kenneth Norman Head, and Homer James “Buck” Horton. Additionally, four law enforcement officers were under scrutiny: Frank DeLaughter and Bill Ogden from the Concordia Parish Sheriff’s Office, probation officer James Buford Gross, and Vidalia Police Chief J.L. “Bud” Spinks.
Despite the cloud of suspicion that hung over these individuals, all of them have since passed away, leaving many questions unanswered. In 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation officially closed the case, yet Edwards’ fate remains unknown.
The haunting legacy of Joseph Edwards serves as a stark reminder of a dark period in our nation’s history, where justice remained elusive and the truth, potentially buried with those who took their secrets to the grave.
