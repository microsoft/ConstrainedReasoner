The only reason i would give it two stars is because the pizza and breadsticks were actually super bomb, not sure why it took over an hour to make."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-07 02:17:11", "review_text": "This place is a joke! Nothing but immature, ignorant, street punk kids. Manager is as ignorant and absent minded as the kids. They serve burnt crazy bread, then when asked how they could serve something like this, they respond with, \" Oh you don't like it like that...?\" I hope this place closes.  Places like this that make their money by Volume, ripping us off, and have the nerve to treat us like dirt need to be boycotted. Stop keeping them open and enabling them to keep these kind of business antics. Take your money elsewhere!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-02 04:25:12", "review_text": "This will be the 5th time I have gone here for crazy bread and they tell me that they don't have any. Pregnancy hormones are to blame for this craving. There is no reason why they shouldn't be out of their menu items all the time. Tonight I got lucky and had \" the last one\". I saw the cashier guy who had just counted back my cash, go straight to them with no gloves on and not washing his hands. As I waited two different customers came in to order some pizza, and the same cashier told them that they only have thin crust. Customer walked out. The other one looked and me and said that they are always out of items or they are just to lazy to bake them. I stood there watching the lady in the back prepare a pizza without gloves on.  This place needs a new manager....  Oh and btw I did get my crazy bread and the breadsticks where harder than a rock ...... and cold. Smh"}]}
