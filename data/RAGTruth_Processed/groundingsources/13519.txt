She Knows Soaps reports that the breakup will devastate Sally, but Nick's next move will blindside the redhead.
When Nick went on a business trip, Sally invited Adam to dinner. After dinner, he walked her to her suite and planted a kiss on her lips. He immediately said that it was a mistake but later admitted that he wanted to do it. He pressed Sally to admit that she still loves him.
While Sally never admitted her feelings to Adam, she couldn't get the kiss out of her head. She was consumed with thoughts of Adam and the various ways Nick could find out about the secret smooch. Y&R spoilers say that Sally decides to come clean and admit everything to Nick.
Soaps Spoilers reports that Nick blows up. He knew that Adam was going to cause trouble between them. But Nick points out the troubling part of this is how twisted Adam's kiss made Sally. He realizes that she's not over his brother. He dumps her, urging her to decide who she wants to be with.
