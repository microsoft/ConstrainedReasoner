It took thousand years to get my food delivered, the worst part is, they gave me wrong food. They said they are going to give me a credit for the food and told me I could come get my food any time. I called them today and they said they don't even have a record for a credit under my name. They started blaming on one of their employees who I don't even know, saying I should have talked with a manager. How the hell do I know which person to talk to among tens of employees there. I just wanted my food ! And then they kept telling me talk to doordash, where I made initial order but in my common sense, why do I have to deal with this afterall?"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-02 20:55:15", "review_text": "Great food portions. They are able to make almost all their curries vegan which was great. The jasmine tea and Thai iced tea are also great. Decent option for a meal. Four stars because service was not the best - felt like they were rushing us to leave and we had to ask multiple times for water."}]}
