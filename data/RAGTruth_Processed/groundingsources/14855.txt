First the service was professional & very courteous.  My wife ordered the house fish plate and I ordered Mary's chicken salad sandwich.   My wife's reaction to her first bite was of pure satisfaction, she closed her eyes and spoke in tongues, she was in heaven, my sandwich on toasted sourdough was simple yet amazing.  Interior of restaurant is clean and modern/chic. Highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-06 22:49:57", "review_text": "If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! I reserved The Daisy for 25 people to surprise my daughter for her 18th birthday. The reservation process including requesting the specific spot in the restaurant and the cakes to serve was easy and hassle-free.  We had family and friends over from Los Angeles and they enjoyed the ambiance, the delicious food, and the super friendly staff.  They reserved the patio for us and it was ready as soon as they opened at 11 am.  We were able to prepare what we needed to surprise my daughter who arrived 10 minutes or so after. Do yourself a favor and visit The Daisy. Excellent location. The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience. The food is absolutely amazing - everything we tasted melted in other mouths. Absolutely the best meal we had while in Santa Barbara. Highly recommend!  Thank you Dominic and staff!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-02 21:58:57", "review_text": "I recently had lunch with my daughter at the Daisy. The food was absolutely phenomenal- everything was very fresh and super flavorful. We shared the mezza platter - which was out of this world. The beet hummus was so good - as was the two other hummus'  The flatbread was grilled to perfection- it was flaky almost the consistency of pastry. The smoked salmon- was excellent and the gem salad with green goddess dressing is a MUST!  The service was super friendly- we ate outside in which is in a quaint setting. Everything was fantastic!  Thank you!"}]}
