Everything was cold . I only have a 30min lunch break , so I didn't go back to return it. I did not enjoy it at all one bit. Pretty upsetting. I payed $20 something for food and drink . The drink tasted pretty flat , no flavor. Plz go somewhere else for Mexican. Los Arroyos or Los Agaves is better and tastier. I rather do NO STARS on this place , but looks like I have too . Sucks I payed soo much and for nothing. I am not returning, however I will let my friends and family know my situation there ."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-22 05:56:00", "review_text": "What can be said about this spot? Well, nice, cozy, comfortable, and hip environment with authentic Mexican decor to enjoy delicious Mexican dishes offered here! Salsa is spicy tomato sauce based, beans between whole and smashed, soups full of vegetables which comes in handy during flu season! And....they also serve hot Mexican chocolate served in hearty mugs! Recommended!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-15 11:22:32", "review_text": "Outdoor seating is an option! This place can be peaceful at certain times of the day, like a Sunday...early evening. \nThe decor inside is super artsy and does help one to leave the daily grind in a different way. The environment really is different inside, in a cool way. I hope to eat inside again, when it feels more comfortable.\nI have mixed feelings about the plates here. I haven't loved my combination plates, but my burritos have been very satisfying! Right now my favorite item on the menu is the Chile Relleno Burrito. The cheese chile relleno is fresh, huge and delicious. I like the moist rice within the burrito, and delicious beans as well. I'm curious to try the house-made mole, chile verde and torta in the future. This is a very unique restaurant. They serve unsweetened mango iced tea as well! Our server was very nice, and refilled our drinks. For now, I will stick to takeout and the patio, until it feels safer to eat inside. That Chile Relleno burrito is comfort food with some nice salsa."}]}
