Honestly it is the best food in IV without a doubt and it's because the owners double as the cooks and are invested in the overall quality of their ingredients and product. They are always entertaining and you could learn a thing or two from just conversing with them during your lunch. Consider helping out this humble mom and pop shop before heading to a big franchise restaurant because they do not compromise anything in their menu and are competitively priced compared to the rest of IV. \n\nI would recommend the Tuna sandwich for it's delicious combination of dressings and tastiness of the fish. Every bite is savory and leaves you wanting more. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches really though."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2013-09-09 04:07:36", "review_text": "The owners of this place should seriously consider investing in a good quality sign for out front.  Currently they have an unlit vinyl sign so the place is basically unnoticeable, especially at night.  I bet they would really see business improve if they weren't cheap about the sign.\n\nGood sandwiches and chili though."}]}
