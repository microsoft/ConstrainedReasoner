Two Missing Girls, One Baffling Pattern: Chilling Parallels in Lauren and Dulce Cases in New Jersey
The unsolved disappearances of Lauren Spierer and Dulce Alavez have stirred up disturbing parallels, potentially offering vital leads to their mysterious fates, says a private detective.
On September 16, 2019, five-year-old Dulce Alavez went missing from Bridgeton City Park, New Jersey, roughly an hour away from Philadelphia. As per reports, Dulce was playing on a swing set with her brother and vanished shortly after. Despite the intense search led by her mother, Noema Alavez Perez, and multiple investigative trails by Bridgeton Police spanning 11 states and even Mexico, no significant leads have been found over the past four years.
Drawing a harrowing comparison to Dulce's case is the story of Lauren Spierer, a 20-year-old Indiana University sophomore. Spierer disappeared on June 3, 2011, in Bloomington, Indiana, after an evening with friends. The last known footage of Spierer, captured around 4:30 am, shows her walking home barefoot in a white shirt and black leggings. She was merely a few blocks away from her apartment when she vanished and hasn't been seen since.
Trent Steele, co-founder of the Florida-based nonprofit Anti-Predator Project, working alongside the families of both missing individuals, shed light on the uncanny resemblances in these cases. Speaking exclusively to The U.S. Sun, Steele emphasized the uniqueness of these cases, remarking that both have remained unsolved for extended periods without a single trace being found. Typically, missing persons either return or are discovered after a short time; however, the complete absence of any clue in both these instances is rare.
Adding another dimension to Dulce's case, Steele labeled it as an "old-school disappearance," referring to the complete absence of technological evidence, which is quite unusual in today's era where many disappearances have online interactions as an underlying factor.
Determined to breathe new life into the investigation, Steele and his team aim to approach Dulce's case from a new angle, relying on fresh perspectives, technologies, and a thorough approach.
While Spierer's parents, Robert and Charlene, still hope for their daughter's return, they maintain a Facebook page dedicated to her.
In another related development, The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released an age-progressed picture of Dulce on the fourth anniversary of her disappearance, hoping it might lead to her identification. Dulce's mother, shocked by the progression, expressed how different her daughter looked but noted that her eyes remained unmistakably familiar.
The quest for answers in both cases continues, as families and investigators seek closure.
