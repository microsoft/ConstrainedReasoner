Thinking of a 'Five Finger Discount'? Walmart & Target Might Already Be on to You!
Former Employee Reveals Retailers' Stealthy Anti-Theft Tactics
Individuals contemplating shoplifting from retail giants like Walmart and Target may want to rethink their actions. A woman, alleging to have previously worked on Walmart's store remodels, took to TikTok to caution potential shoplifters about the hefty consequences they could face.
Chey (@bbyghoulcy) took to the platform to share insights, especially with her self-proclaimed "kleptomaniac followers", about how these large retailers might be silently monitoring thefts. She revealed that companies such as Walmart and Target have methods to track the cumulative value of stolen items.
"When the value reaches a certain threshold, you can be arrested instantly and face a grand theft charge," she warned.
Emphasizing on the retailers' high-tech security measures, Chey shed light on the sophistication of the surveillance cameras that can capture minute details from great distances, such as the text on an employee's badge. In instances of suspected theft, these cameras can zoom in to capture a clear image of the perpetrator's face.
Additionally, Chey mentioned discreet microphones installed in ceilings, disguised as speakers, that can pick up even whispered conversations. She urged, “If you believe you’re getting away unnoticed, you're mistaken.”
Grand theft charges, as Chey highlighted, depend on the cumulative stolen value. This threshold can vary based on state laws; for instance, New York and California typically label thefts as grand if the value is above $1,000, while Florida sets the limit at $750.
Chey credited her knowledge to her past work at a company named Sasser, which was involved in remodeling stores for major retailers, including the installation of these discreet microphones.
Reiterating her warning, Chey stated, “You will be caught eventually. The theft isn’t going unnoticed.”
Interestingly, similar allegations about Target’s strategy concerning shoplifting were brought up in 2020. When approached, Target clarified to Business Insider that they don’t follow any policy to accumulate shoplifting charges till they become felonious. They emphasized that their focus remains on the safety of their customers, staff, and community. They also acknowledged having certain security measures against shoplifting.
Walmart and Target have yet to offer a comment on Chey’s recent claims.
