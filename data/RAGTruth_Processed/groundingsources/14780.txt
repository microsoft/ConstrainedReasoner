The location is located within a courtyard with other wineries, so look at the map to locate this. The girl giving us samples was very quick and efficient when filling up our glass. You can tell she has it down bc she would describe each wine very quickly. The wines do taste great, but it's meh when compare to all the other places. I think I liked the shiraz the best."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-01 19:53:14", "review_text": "Tasting flight is $20 for 5 wines. We came here on a Tuesday around 5pm. There's both outdoor and indoor seating. We opt for indoor since noone else was sitting outdoors. We felt like it'll take too long for the staff to walk to us to pour wine. We sat close to the open doorway. Wines are defintely light and easy to drink. But we like our wines to have more flavor. Interesting Alien decors."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-11-13 04:25:11", "review_text": "The name of the winery was the reason we stopped in! Love the name of all the wines. Cute decor. Just wish they had more wine to select from! We didn't try them with the chocolates because we were full from dinner but I think it would be a great thing to try for dessert."}]}
