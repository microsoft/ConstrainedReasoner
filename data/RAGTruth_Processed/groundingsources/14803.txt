I'm with Anne -- refreshing to hit a dive bar that isn't asses to elbows with ironic mustaches, cutoff jeans, and topsiders. \n\nThe staff is friendly, the peanuts and pretzels are free, they have Coors, and they have Hank Williams (Sr) on the juke box. If you are a pool player, the regulars here kept the table going and seemed pretty nice. \n\nGood spot to grab a drink if you find yourself with a half hour in Goleta."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2009-10-10 19:07:59", "review_text": "the two stars bac dor gets are simply because of the sweet, elderly dude behind the bar and the ok jukebox.  despite friends who love bac dor, im NOT enthusiastic about the altercations we get in every single time with angry and drunk-as-shit regulars. imo, there are plenty of other goleta bars that are more fun.  i say let the oldtimers be in peace at bac dor.  the drinks themselves arent cheap either."}]}
