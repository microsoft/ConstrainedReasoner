They've been slip sliding downhill lately.  I ordered items including a Big Mac and a few bites in, I noticed there wasn't any burger on the top part of the sandwich.  I lifted the bun and saw that only half the patty was there.  Nice.  Also, they had some tattooed gangsta wannabe working the counter for picking up orders.  He called my number and I picked it up and said thank you.  The A hole just looked off to the side and said \"yep\".  Not loving so much."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-06-08 05:05:52", "review_text": "Went to UCSB for four years, came back for graduation and stopped at McDonald's at 10pm. Best customer service I've ever received. Crazy. The employee Boni truly an amazing, sweet, understanding and patient person. 10/10 service by Boni & I've honestly never been so happy leaving a McDonald's, ever in life. Thank you Boni!! U deserve the best!"}]}
