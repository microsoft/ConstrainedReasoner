Fantastic! This was the line on loop in my head a few nights ago at Night Lizard. After several visits to this State Street brewery, I can easily say it's one of my tops. Staff are friendly, beers are tasty, and the vibe--whether sitting indoors or out--is neat. Gotta love all those hanging plants. \n\nAmong beers tried are the Gnatcatcher IPA, Tiger Salamander Saison, and Monkeyflower Double White Ale. All are solid brews. I have yet to sample the food menu from Yona Redz, but look forward to it. \n\nThere's usually room to sit on the outdoor patio, a Covid-safer option that offers great people-watching. I love holding a tulip glass of a tasty beverage, seeing folks passing by and eying the place. Thinking at them 'yes, you do want to stop here!' I smile a bit when someone does."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-01 00:48:08", "review_text": "Trivia night is soooo cool. Best kombucha and seltzer.
