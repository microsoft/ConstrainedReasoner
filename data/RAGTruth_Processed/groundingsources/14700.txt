If you read my original review you'll see what a terrible time we had with the manager and the wait staff. \n\nReally..no matter how good the food of a place may be..it will always be soured if the customer service provided by the staff is...pardon my bluntness here...utter crap.  This place turned me and the wife off East Indian food for years.  \n\nClosing couldn't have happened to a worse place.. in my opinion.  If it does re-open, I hope its under new ownership who value their customers needs and desires and are cognizant that we have placed like Yelp to express our pleasure or displeasure at the experiences we receive."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2011-02-24 05:34:42", "review_text": "worst service ever received- the food is not worth suffering through this aweful service!! server never asked us how our food was-didnt refill water-seemed annoyed and frustrated he was at work- you could receive better service at mcdonalds and i am not kidding at all- obviously based on other reviews this was not just a fluke-apparently this resteraunt does not care about its customers and is fine allowing lazy people to work there and give horrible service and expect everyone just to pay and keep coming- the place should shut down and reopen under new management who know how to run a resteraunt and hire adequate employees! sucks!"}]}
