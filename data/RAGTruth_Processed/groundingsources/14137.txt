This has been on my list of places to check out so I was stoked to finally make it here. \n\nI suggest getting here for happy hour or booking a table on Open Table. We got here at 5:30 pm and it quickly filled up by 6:00 pm! Parking is tight and thanks to my rear view camera I was able to get out with ease!!! But take this as a word of caution since it's a tight lot.\n\nThe decor is like I stepped back into what I imagined grandma's doll house to be (in a good way) and they played mainstream country which was fun. Decor is definitely kitschy. Outside was adorable with lights and picnic style tables. Would have loved to sit outside if I had brought a sweater for the one week it was cold in SB!\n\nNow onto the food and service. Our waitress was really friendly and nice. Considering she was the only waitress I saw in the joint, she did a pretty good job checking in on us. Food came out fast but drinks were a bit slow as the night progressed along with seeing our waitress. No biggie, the food and drinks were good and I was in good company. \n\nThe Blind Date was one of the better bacon wrapped dates. Bigger than Milk and Honey and I liked the bacon texture better.\n\nHabanero Pork Sliders had good spice but I rather save room for something else.\n\nBrussel Sprouts are shredded, saut\u00e9ed. Wish they had a crisp and more flavor to them. I LOVE Brussels sprouts and this was disappointing.\n\nClassic Cheeseburger had good flavor but the fries were not crispy to my liking.\n\nKai's Pizza recommended by our waitress and was delish! It even stayed crispy when I ate the leftovers the next couple day. \n\nManhattan was pretty awesome and would get it again and the Moscow Mule was really good. Not too sweet for me. \n\nI suggest checking out this place next time your in the area!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2015-11-07 03:08:05", "review_text": "Great place. Great drinks, great food. While a little dimly lit, the feel of the place is cozy and \"out of the way\" from the hustle and bustle of State street. Since it was a Friday, it got busier around 6:30-6:45 (towards the end of happy hour). It was a great experience and I would definitely come back with friends for a low key, chill get together."}]}
