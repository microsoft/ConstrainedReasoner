Spicy ramen makes my soul feel healed and all the ramen broths are both rich and still light and flavorful. Pricing is great for what u get and the buns are killer. Also great place to get a beer."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-05 06:00:25", "review_text": "Upon buying my food, the guy at the register calmly looked up at and said \"I love you.\" To be honest, I was taken aback by the remark and made slightly uncomfortable, but I got my two buns and sat down.\n\nBoth buns I got, the popcorn chicken bun and the stewed pork belly bun, were spicy which I wasn't really expecting. To be honest, I was disappointed by the taste and only ate half of each before tossing out the remaining contents of the tray. \n\nIts good that there is some cheap street food in IV--on the order of $3 a bun--but there was an apparent lack of diversity in flavors, as both were soaked in the same spicy red sauce. If you're not a fan of that specific cilantro sauce, which I imagine is pretty foreign to the Californian palette, this place is not for you--or me for that matter.\n\nSo if you want food that's all the same specific flavor, and a server who makes you uncomfortable, I guess this is your place."}]}
