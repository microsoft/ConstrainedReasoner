{"question": "what to do when shutting off water for winter", "passages": "passage 1:An alternative to using the rain mode is simply to shut off the power to the controller. If you do, you'll need to reprogram the time and potentially all your other settings as well, in the spring. 3. Drain the pipes: Now you need to remove the water from the pipes and sprinklers so that it won't freeze/expand and break the pipe.\n\npassage 2:Please download the Rain Bird Homeowner's Guide to Winterization for detailed instructions on how to prepare your irrigation system for the winter months. 1. Insulate your assets: Shut off the water supply to the irrigation system. The main shut off valve for your irrigation system needs to be protected against freezing. Make sure it is wrapped with insulation (foam insulation tape and a plastic bag) to protect it from harsh winter temperatures and prevent it from freezing. If you do not have a main shut off valve, you might consider installing one as a preventative investment.\n\npassage 3:This is not necessary unless temperatures are expected to be 28 degrees or below for at least 4 hours. (Be sure to turn off the faucets after the threat of freezing weather.) Open cabinet doors under sinks adjacent to outside walls. In unheated garages, shut off water to washing machines.\n\n"}
