I assume they're cleaning it out, so okay, they're not gonna serve it. But what I saw next was the woman scoop out ice cream FROM the same red sanitation bucket. Into two cups, and prep them and serve them with whipped cream and a cherry on top for the guy behind me.\n\nI don't believe that red sanitation bucket is, um...SANITARY. That bucket isn't food grade safe, I assume! I've worked in a couple kitchens before and let me tell you I've never seen food, let alone ice cream, get cleaned out into the red sanitation bucket and then get SERVED. Normally, This bucket is filled with kitchen sanitation liquid, to be changed every four hours with a new towel. I'm very sure I'm never coming back to this place to see this unsanitary practice."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-12-21 02:58:32", "review_text": "Hahahahaha wtf is up with all the reviews!?
