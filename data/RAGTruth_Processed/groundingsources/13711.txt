I'm not a big donut person because they're often oily / heavy / you can taste that it's been fried in old oil / all of the above. But these donuts were so light and fluffy and all the flavors were delicious. My favorite was the everything donut. Still dreaming about it today \n\nWould definitely recommend & return"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-11-16 20:33:39", "review_text": "I LOVE DONUTS, like srsly in love -- so this is one of the few categories I judge very harshly on. The donuts here were really good, but my favorite is always going to be Blue Star Donuts and those are fucking amazing. So unless it was amazing, it could not compare. Still a great business, with great donuts so please continue to support despite my ok review. Judge for yourself, you will probably really really enjoy it!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-17 17:37:04", "review_text": "Best donuts in SB. Great quality ingredients, friendly staff. Also amazing drinks. Only place in town that has coconut milk. Iced Coconut chai is to die for.  They are currently closed and opening new location. Wish they were doing a pop-up through somewhere else in the meantime. Need these donuts back in my  life!!"}]}
