They have always been quite popular and there's typically a packed room. I feel that the gentleman hosting the event does a wonderful job and the music selection is superior. \n\nI came in this time around on a Thursday night, fiesta week, and there were surprisingly just a few other patrons. Talk about a hidden gem of a spot. Sandy, our bartender was friendly and efficient and made sure that our group was taken care of. \n\nThe bar was clean and organized. Even the bathroom was tidy which is a rare occurrence for dive bars. I have only ever ordered beers from here but they do have a full selection for your needs. I like how Tiburon also has a modern jukebox which you can control from an app on your phone. Being able to select songs from the comfort of your seat beats the heck out of feeding money into some dirty machine. \n\nA good overall spot if you're looking to separate yourself from the craze of the downtown bar scene."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-12-16 06:07:14", "review_text": "Amazing bar.  I'm from out of town and I heard of this place from multiple establishments.  Finally checked it out after a long days work and I have to say- it definitely delivered.  Nice spot, easy to get too,  with friendly local people that will strike up a conversation with you.  Special shoutout to the bartender Rosa who served the BEST drinks.  Ask for for a cocktail if you really want to be treated - that's her specialty!  Will definitely be coming back here when I can!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-11-24 19:45:32", "review_text": "Great local watering hole. Been here a couple times while passing through Santa Barbara. Enjoy the place so much I usually spend more time there than I had anticipated. Staff and patrons are friendly. Definitely a no-frills dive bar. However, they do have a pool table."}]}
