{"question": "how do wireless bluetooth adapter work", "passages": "passage 1:After that it was just a matter of learning how to use the app. Transferred dozens of files from my android tablet to my laptop without any problems whatsoever. Great item for the price if you need a Bluetooth adapter. I have not used this adapter for headphones or speakers etc, so I don't know how it will work for those purposes. Works great for transferring files from a nexus 7 android tablet to a Windows 7 computer though.\n\npassage 2:Wireless access points receive a signal from a wireless adapter requesting a connection. Wireless adapters can also be set up to act as wireless access points. This kind of setup is called ad hoc. Bluetooth adapters connect from one adapter to another, though this typically serves to pair the devices for a specific purpose, such as sharing a file or connecting a wireless earpiece to a phone. In order to mitigate problems from too many devices connecting to a single access point, wireless adapters use a Request To Send, or RTS.\n\npassage 3:The Keyboard Elite for Bluetooth and the Wireless Optical Desktop for Bluetooth do not have First Connect buttons on their transceivers. For more information about pairing these keyboards to your computer, see the Bluetooth Connection Guide or the documentation included with your Bluetooth program.\n\n"}
