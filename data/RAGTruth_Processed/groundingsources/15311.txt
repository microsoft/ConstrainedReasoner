{"question": "how to bake potatoes on the grill", "passages": "passage 1:Heat and Grills. You can grill potatoes on either a gas or charcoal grill. Grilling potatoes uses dry heat, which qualifies them to be called baked potatoes. Because of the high heat of grills, you need to use both direct and indirect heat, cooking them with hotter and cooler cooking temperatures, respectively.\n\npassage 2:You can grill your potatoes without any foil, as the skin keeps the potatoes from sticking. Grilling without foil allows more smokiness from the grill to penetrate the potato. However, by wrapping your potatoes in foil you can use seasonings and oil during cooking, boosting crispiness and flavor.\n\npassage 3:Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat. Prepare four foil squares large enough to fold over one potato each. Spread butter onto foil in a large enough area that the potato will be completely covered when rolled up. Sprinkle salt, garlic, pepper, and Italian seasoning evenly over foil. Roll each potato in the foil; puncture the package (including the potato) with a fork or knife a few times. Grill for 1 hour, or until soft, turning the potatoes often. Serve with your favorite toppings.\n\n"}
