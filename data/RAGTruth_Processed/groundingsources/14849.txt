There are many places to choose to eat at the public market, but you are always guaranteed a delicious meal when you eat here.\n\nWent here yesterday and ordered the quesa birria. IT WAS SO GOOD. Most restaurants don't know how to master birria, but this place, they know how to cook birria. There was no consume to dip because it's already inside. That means that each bite is juicy and flavorful and just the best. \n\nI also ordered the doraditos for my kids and they loved it. Each crunchy rolled up taco came with quesa Fresca on top and lettuce. We ordered the horchata to compliment the meal and it was perfect. Their horchata is made with almond milk and unlike any horchata I've ever had. \n\nYou can really tell how much this restaurant values good quality ingredients, and it truly is apparent in the food. Don't miss this place if you're at the public market!"}]}
