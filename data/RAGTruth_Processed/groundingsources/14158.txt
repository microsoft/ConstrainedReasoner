I came with a big party (around 15 people). We were pushed to the back of the restaurant and left to ourselves. Since our party was so big and there was a guaranteed gratuity fee, I felt as though the staff didn't put any effort into servicing us. None of the staff gave us water until we asked after being ignored for 30 minutes, and after another 20 minutes they then took our order. Waiting for the food to arrive took even longer. Overall you can find better food for a much better price elsewhere"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2018-02-06 22:10:45", "review_text": "R.I.P.  \nFor several reasons, Pascucci was not a good match for the Goleta-local clientele.  Last year I talked with the owner about the bad smell (sewage-y) and the hostile wait-staff, and the often dry, dry, dry food.  She said \"everything is fine and we have lots of customers\".   Oh well.\n\nHowever, hope you stay strong in Downtown Santa Barbara.  \nThe garlic-cheese bread is usually pretty good."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2018-01-12 07:47:41", "review_text": "The first time I tried Pascucci was at a banquet I attended. It was great so I decided to stop by one of their locations. Service is VERY slow, even on slow nights. Even getting our bread took a long time. Portions are small, especially for the price. The first time I got the fettuccine Alfredo, I liked it. Not amazing, but good enough to order again. The next time I ordered it, it wasn't good. The chicken left a taste I can only describe as disgusting in my mouth and the sauce itself was bland. I was a little discouraged, but I ordered it again the next time I was there. It was just as bad as the previous time. That was the last time I went. Some dishes are ok, but again, not great and pretty small,  so I would pick another establishment over this one. I really wish I could have liked it as much as the first time I tried it, but unfortunately that was not the case."}]}
