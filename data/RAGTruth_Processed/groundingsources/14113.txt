Once I didn't have cash and his card reader wasn't working--he said to just come back another day to pay him. Doesn't get more trustworthy and local than that! \n\nTheir truck slogan reads: \"PRUEBA--DISFRUTA--REPITE! (Try...Enjoy...Repeat!)\". Just like that, you'll be an addict and regular like myself! \nOh, heck, he knew I'd be back for my fix. \n\nFernando also does catering for large events (quincea\u00f1eras, weddings, etc) with the toppings (chocolate and caramel sauce), plus offers local delivery!\nNote: Keep in mind that they're there only in Santa Barbara Mondays and Thursdays but travel to Lompoc, Vandenberg and Lompoc the remaining days of the week.\n\nSince I'm such a Churro fan, check out where else in Santa Barbara County to get your churro on--though none can triumph Fernando's!\nhttps://www.yelp.com/collection/Y3ZRTDE_Iu9CUfDN3Dq4FA?utm_content=Collections&utm_source=ishare"}]}
