The wait was maybe 7-10 minutes before ordering but so worth it. This place had such a wide selection of bagel sandwiches that it was hard to settle with the Earth, Wind, and Fire Bagel Sandwich. It was AMAZING! One was enough to share for two people. I was able to choose which bagel I wanted and ended with the Galaxy bagel! The siracha added a nice touch. Would love to return here."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-12-23 17:50:50", "review_text": "Forgot to put bacon on bagel. I'm now very sad.

We get there about 3 minutes before estimated pick up, as we walk in there is a blonde white girl with a bag on her shoulder who glanced at us and went right back on her phone. We ask if our order is ready which we didnt expect it to be but still asked, and she grabs my two bagels each wrapped in one wrapper and placed on a random counter and my two hot chocolates the same. I nicely ask if they can rewarm them since they were left out for God knows how long, with the purse on her shoulder still she continues to work and make sandwhiches. After warming up the hot chocolates she slams it on the counter, i say thank you and she rolls her eyes and walks away. I'm outside drinking some of the hot chocolate in the nice rainy weather enjoying my time and I hear some elementary school style gossip going on inside of the business. The employees are hurdled up as the girl is telling them \"oh they couldve warmed it up themselves \" and continued not only gossiping about a customer right infront of them but also trying to state that we as customers should be doing her job?? I then nicely go in and let her know to next time wait for the customers to leave and then talk about them and right away she starts going off telling me i dont give a **** i dont care you can warm your own **** up and ended it up with a nice F U. As a business owner myself this is just embarrasing for the owner and knowing owners check their yelp reviews i know you'll see this. Extremely unproffesional and rude behavior and the county needs to go check on this business, employees watching tiktoks while customers are inside, slamming drinks and gossiping, working while having a purse on your shoulder. That absolutely flabbergasted me like seriously hire workers not jokes and clowns. Great bagels though !!"}]}
