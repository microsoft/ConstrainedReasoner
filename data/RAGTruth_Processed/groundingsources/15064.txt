Probably was a 2 star joint but on extacy and bourbon all things seem better, but obviously my enebriated mind was no match for reality, the bastard got shut down. Scianara hot dog memories. I take my hat off for your dubius efforts. Now that I am sober I doubt that I will need to frequent the likes of your kind! No lips and buttholes for me mom!

Ordered 2 chili dogs, 2 plain dogs, an order of rings, and an \"LA\" dog... $45 (they overcharged us $8, by the way... And when confronting the registry clerk, she turned a blind eye on us and didn't even acknowledge our complaint on her possible \"accidental\" overcharge. $45 spent at Jack n the box would have been WAYYYY more worth it! I know we're here in SB, where $45 is no big deal, but WOW!!! Are you serious?"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2013-11-22 18:52:57", "review_text": "These hot dogs are unfortunately very basic but not very good.  I stopped in to use a Groupon but as soon as I ate the hot dogs, I knew I wouldn't be back.  The fries were pretty good.  That was the saving grace of my meal.  I don't think I'll be back."}]}
