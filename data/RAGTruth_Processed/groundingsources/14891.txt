If you get sick of the State Street scene and want a bit of a different, more relaxed vibe, I would go to Reds. The bar food is also super yummy, and the bartenders are lovely people. I really love this place."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-04-23 01:42:23", "review_text": "Not a fan of a place who likes to serve alcohol to underage kids......

Great vibe. \n\nMy boyfriend and I hung out here while we were visiting Santa Barbara on a saturday night. There was ample seating (which is a huge deal to me). \n\nThe bartenders were super great and it seemed like a place for locals. Not touristy which was great."}]}
