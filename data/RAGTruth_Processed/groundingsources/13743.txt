Not only do they plate it beautifully and serve you after you order at the front, but they use fresh ingredients and make their own tortillas, chips, guacamole and salsas. Bonus points for vegan section on menu."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-03-29 02:39:34", "review_text": "Ordered online and the order went through without a hitch but apparently this location is closed?
