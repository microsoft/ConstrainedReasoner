There were two orders a head of mine yet it took approximately 30 minutes to prepare two burgers, fries and a corn dog. The food was good, but not above average. All that being said, I would've returned if the service had been better. Not only did the food take forever, but I practically had to beg the cashier for extra ketchup which was ridiculous considering there was only one small pre poured container in the bag. So was the person eating the corn dog supposed to dip their corn dog in the small container and the rest us just pass it around sparingly? The cashier just passive aggressively stared at me and blinked multiple times when I asked for extra ketchup. Given that it's a small spot I even tipped on my order takeout order to help support small businesses. I wanted so badly for this to be my go spot, but given the excessive wait times, value for price and not so great service, it will instead be a one and done."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-11 21:06:00", "review_text": "We stopped here on our way to LA and the food was just EXCELLENT!... the double cheeseburger and fries were superb!! as well as the freeze and malt... this is definitively a hidden gem in the small beach town of Summerland."}]}
