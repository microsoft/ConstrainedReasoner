I hadn't realized that Fatburger was a franchise and could be the main reason this location recieves a well deserved one star. The burgers, no doubt, were okay, good but not great like other locations. Food-wise this is not a good place to take a newbie to Fatburger as it will leave an a-ok impression on them. It's location was convenient, but the bathroom situation and the ridiculously high prices absolutely ruined the whole experience for me. $6 for a burger or $5 for a baby burger (which was smaller than the burger in a mcdonalds kids meal folks), no fries no drink. Two combos ran us about $15 for the baby fat meals. Absolutely an utter waste of money. At this point I was ready to give this location 3 stars just for the money to quantity ratio vs. the overall appearance of the place (which was high profile). Once I ventured to use the state required facilities I come to realize the women's facilities were not only out of order, but in the middle of construction and had been for weeks without another option for use and no warning up front otherwise. Minus a star. So I go to use the only bathroom available for use, the mens bathroom - and what a huge mistake. This place looked like it had not been cleaned in months. Graffiti on the walls, the stench appauling, trash, stains and piss everywhere, absolutely NO protective seat covers (not even an empty container for one), no soap, nothing hygeinic or usable about the bathroom and if someone had cleaned it that week, let alone that day, it would not have been that horrible. Another star  gone. You cannot run a restaurant in the state like this, and being a tourist in town that was a huge let down for the City of Santa Barbara tourism. Visitors are going to frequent places they are familiar with elsewhere and when those places are sub-par in state required bathroom facilities it's a huge STAIN (no pun intended) for the area. Avoid this location altogether. They should not even be in the food business."}]}
