Such great food. The nachos were incredible and the service was great. My wife eats low carb and she got the bowl with no rice and it tasted healthy and delicious. I recommend getting fresh avocado in place of the guacamole sauce for the extra charge on the nachos. It's like 1.50 extra but so worth it!!! We will be back next time we are in SB."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-11-19 05:14:43", "review_text": "The owner Efren (from Michoac\u00e1n), allowed me to have dinner and a cold beer after they were closing (slow\nMonday night).
