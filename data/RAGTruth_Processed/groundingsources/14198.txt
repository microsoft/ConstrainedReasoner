While staying in the Santa Barbara area, I just wanted a good piece of Pizza. We stopped here while on a walk and ordered an onion and cheese pizza, small size.  Neither of us could believe how fresh and great it was! The sauce was a good homemade red with Italian spices and fresh tomato flavor. Just enough good cheese.  We stopped in twice after having such great luck.  Tried the salads, pasta and more pizza, garlic bread and wine.  Family owned and run place that's cordial and homey.   This is the kind of place you find in Chicago and New York. Just a little gem with friendly people and really good Italian food!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-08-17 01:35:09", "review_text": "Well, I tried eating at this Petrini's again, and I'm really sad to report that the food has gotten worse AND more expensive. The Chicken Picatta was drowning in butter, or grease; I'm not sure what that was. The fettuccine Alfredo that came with it was undercooked and had zero taste. We also were served garlic bread that was burned to black. To make things worse, I took the food home because I just could eat it at the restaurant. I was hungry later so I ate it. \nOh My God.....I couldn't keep it down. I got such a stomach ache from that food. Petrini's , you are a local restaurant and I really try to support local businesses, but you are bad for my health."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2016-07-11 15:51:04", "review_text": "I have not been in here for many years, but we stopped in the other night and it was tasty traditional american italian food for a great price. The meat raviolis were very tender and delicious and the sauce was spot on. The spaghetti and meatballs (the yard stick for any italian review) were also very good. I also really enjoyed my cup of minestrone soup, really hit the spot. The waiters were very attentive and the place had a very welcoming and tidy atmosphere. \n\nThe only downside, the water tasted horrible, I think they need to replace their filter or something."}]}
