I'm complaining about a Store Manager's response, or lack thereof, to my Visit on December 17th, as well as entire dough ball on the floor, , as well as store employee picking a fight with me, as well as waiting 15 minutes to place a phone order, being hung up 3 times, having to come into the store to place the order, waiting, and than being harassed( yelled at for taking the picture) by a store employee, sitting in front of the store. I asked employee, what the store managers name was, and she says, I CAN NOT GIVE THAT INFORMATION.  I have 3 pictures, including store rcpt. . Provide me email address for color pictures. I will now send this store Board of Health Santa Barbara. CA\nAlso, the employee, women, with long hair, who took care of me, should stop going to the window, and playing with her hair, while she is making pizza. You can tell who this is by store receipt and time.\nOn December 17th , I was having a problem placing an order, I called Store # 7873  MILPAS STREET, SANTA BARBARA. . I can't tell you how disappointing this lack of customer service has been after all of the years that I have been a Domino's customer. AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY. ITS NOW BEEN 2 WEEKS, WAITED TO WRITE THIS, AND STILL NO REPLY FROM STORE OWNER, STORE MANAGER, OR CORPORATE OFFICE.  PLEASED TO REPORT BOARD OF HEALTH WAS ON TOP OF THIS."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-20 20:54:56", "review_text": "We are usually happy with our pizzas from this dominos. Today's order was awful. Pizzas were way under cooked and the border was 4-5 inches with no cheese or toppings. Like eating a large dough ball."}]}
