Great flavor, the pizza does get a little cold pretty quick with how thick it is. The macaroni is pretty dang spicy and has a lot of jalape\u00f1os so use caution if you don't like heat. The pizza is also a little pricey but definitely worth checking out."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-28 22:20:21", "review_text": "Extremely bad experience with Patxi's at Santa Barbara. Came here a few days ago to order takeout. They put us on hold for more than 30 minutes and never came back. Called once again after an hour and same experience. They don't seem to care for customers. We have been to other Patxi's location and had good experiences."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-28 21:29:16", "review_text": "Go here - definitely!  Been in Santa Barbara a couple days and have been here twice.  One family member is gluten intolerant and they take special care to ensure no cross-contamination.  From the regular menu, we tried the classic supreme on a thin crust which was solid, then a spinach pesto which was spectacular.  The spinach pesto comes with homemade tomato sauce - get the pan crust which looked a heck of a lot like a deep dish to me!  And on top of that, service was excellent"}]}
