{"question": "how to price a tiling job", "passages": "passage 1:Pricing up tiling jobs is relatively simple. The costs include the price of the tiles you have chosen, along with the necessary grout, adhesive and labour costs. Some tiling work, like laying a small area in a bathroom with not too many nooks and crannies will be on the lower end of the price range.ost a tiling job and we will look for up to 4 local tilers who will quote for your work. You are not obliged to accept quotes but you could find that our service will save you time (tilers contact you), and money (by comparing multiple quotes you will get the most competitive prices for your tiling project hopefully).\n\npassage 2:Each price is for his labour, adhesive and grout. No tiles are included. Lets assume a 8\u2019 x 6\u2019 bathroom, with one window reveal, walls ready for tiling, with the bath etc in situ, to be tiled in 8\u201d (200mm) square tiling.Job 1. Tile the bathroom, floor to ceiling, apply grout, then silicone around the bath.ob 4. We\u2019re in the kitchen now. You want him to tile between your kitchen work surface and the wall cabinets above, using 6\u201d (150mm x 150mm) tiles, along one 8\u2019 (2400mm) wall, with two electrical sockets to take off and replace. This is a nice leisurely day for one man plus a small amount of materials\u2026\u2026..\u00a3180.00.\n\npassage 3:The installation cost was $7 sq ft. Then I wound up at a fabulous tile store in our area and discovered this beautiful travertine tile that is being eliminated from the store's stock-- priced down from $8.50 sq ft to match my $4.50 sq ft. But the cost of sealant by my tile guy would add another $630 to the job.While I think the natural stone would look great, I'm not sure I'm up to the worry about staining the stone...and think the $630 is an add-on charge I would avoid with the porcelain.o the Duraceramic would cost be probably $200 and going with the installer and a tile or travertine could cost me $600-700 or more (no idea what wholesale cost is on tile/travertine). This project would also involve cutting out a section of wood floor that is appox 24-30 by 52.\n\n"}
