There is a tall lady working in the front who has an arrogant attitude towards the customers. I am writing a review because they did something that was a risk to health safety. We ordered things for dine in at 2:34pm on Dec 4 ( order number 829). The lady with an attitude served us our food and mistakenly gave us an extra drink. After a couple of minutes, we figured out that there was an extra drink we did not pay for. My mom returned it coz we wanted to be honest. At the counter, she was just arrogantly told by the same lady to just leave it on the counter which was weird because usually restaurants just let u have anything that u wanna return out of courtesy and health safety I am sure. Well, to our surprise, they gave the same cup to a different customer after a few minutes. BIG RED FLAG! What if we were bad people who put poison into the drink or something?? Restaurants r not supposed to give any food or drinks to their customers unless it came directly from their kitchen. And what made it worse for us is that the same lady took a short break to eat ice cream and without a care sat with her shoes up on the seat. What is the point of sanitizing the tables when their employees will just do that? She even left her shoe mark on the seat. I wanted to take a photo but by the time I took out my phone to do it, she got up. I have never seen that type of unprofessionalism from a McDonald's employee. And I never had high standards for McDonald's. I suggest the owner to check the cctvs. Restroom for women were gross too!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-11-25 19:26:42", "review_text": "The COVID-19 \"safety  precautions\"that they have in place is completely ridiculous and utter overkill . It gives the bad attitude not friendly workers more reason to talk to the customers like we're stupid.
