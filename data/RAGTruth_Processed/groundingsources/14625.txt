Mike was there right on time to set up the system and show me how to use it. When we were done for the night, we left the system there for him to pick up. Everything I needed was provided: a couple of mics, a few songbooks, and a signup sheet. The system itself was very easy to use, and I appreciated being able to adjust as needed, from the key of the song to the volume of both the music and the singer. It's nice not to have to shout to be heard over karaoke in a regular bar, and I loved being able to adjust the key even mid-song! The song selection was big and varied, and having the songbook available as a PDF was very helpful: several of us downloaded the PDF onto our phones/tablets, which made it easier to search for songs, both during and before the event. My friends and I had a blast! We loved not having to wait hours till our next turn, and experimenting with songs that we would ordinarily be too shy to try \"in public\". What a terrific service overall, and at such a great price. Can't wait to use this again for our next event!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-12-23 17:29:15", "review_text": "We just used this service for about the fifth time...we use it for all of our parties.  Pro Karaoke Systems not only provides you with instant party entertainment, but the owner makes the whole experience SO easy.  First he emailed us a PDF version of the song book weeks in advance so we could pick out a few songs ahead of our event.  The machine comes with easy to follow personalized instructions and the owner will deliver and walk you through the whole setup as well. And last but not least, every time we've used this service the machine is always up to date with the latest hit songs, which makes the party that much more fun.  Highly recommended!"}]}
