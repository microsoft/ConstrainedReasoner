The place doesn't have great ambience, but take out food is really good. The tofu and chicken are always good, but the veggies are even better!\nThe coconut curries are really my favorites. The salad can do with some more spice."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-16 02:34:23", "review_text": "Arguably my favorite authentic Thai restaurant in Santa Barbara. I am a big fan of all of their soups and their Pad Thai as well. Fairly priced with ample portions that will not only make your stomach happy but also your wallet as well. I find Your Place being a Top5 choice whenever I find myself not wanting to make dinner throughout the week."}]}
