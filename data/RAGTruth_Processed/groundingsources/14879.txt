The food has no Korean taste whatsoever but rather another Asian like flavor.  The menu food pictures look korean but the actual taste of The stews, side dishes and the meat dish are all wrong. Only 2 girls working so if you're seated upstairs like I was you won't be served for about two hours.  Worst experience!"}]}
