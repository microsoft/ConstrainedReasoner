The Coin Margarita has casa amigos (yum) so we started with that... then I got a frozen mango because I was craving one. Both were great. I wish the coin marg was a little bit bigger glass just because I also drink like a fish (not more booze, just a little more mix) the mango marg is more of a one and done (for me, anyways). But the mango tasted so fresh.... It was a dessert. We got six tacos-Al pastor and steak. \n\nWish we would have went with the special.... I believe it was pork and pineapple(had set up on the patio with the meat and pineapple spinning, fresh cut to order) but I assumed that it was Al pastor and it's not, but it was on the board... def coming back to try that.  \nQueso fundido was good! Classic. \n\nService was good, they work together, so you see multiple servers. But great service. Overall enjoyed my experience here!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-20 21:52:26", "review_text": "It's been a few years since I have been able to dine here and my expectations were exceeded.  I sat down inside, was greeted and quickly asked if I would like a beverage.  Of course, I had to order a margarita!  Hand squeezed lime makes this drink fresh and delicious.  I ordered the Chipotle Seafood Enchiladas with rice and beans... I intended on taking half home for lunch tomorrow, but that didn't happen.  It was absolutely delicious and I ate both enchiladas.  I also put a dent into the beans and rice, but man, I think next time, I'd just order the enchiladas and eat the extra sauce with the chips.  Their beans and rice are great but that enchilada sauce was out of this world."}]}
