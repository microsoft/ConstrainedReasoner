I've tried a bunch of places and either it doesn't end up on bread (it was like pizza dough used to make a sandwich), the chicken isn't breaded, or it tastes awful. I finally found a good sandwich here. I'll try a calzone next. Side note: no picture available because I inhaled my sandwich."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-21 04:07:52", "review_text": "This is easily the best calzone in SB now that Sal's on Milpas closed. Friendly staff and very generous portions. The owner Andreas used to own IV location and he runs this spot too, really cool guy. Can't go wrong great locals spot! Reliable & good food. Their homemade Italian salad dressing is delicious."}]}
