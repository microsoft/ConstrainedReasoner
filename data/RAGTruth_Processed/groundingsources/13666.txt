Chef owned and operated with a Japanese family run staff. The fish is extremely consistent and is of a slightly higher grade than anyplace else in town. The cold Sake list is affordable but good and the special board is local and or seasonal changing weekly or so. Best sushi in town. Ambiance is nice but its geared towards foodies and all the $ seems to be on the plates."}]}
