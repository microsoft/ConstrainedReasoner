Dolphins Trade Target: Chase Young
The Miami Dolphins are coming off a controversial loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night which saw two early-season Super Bowl contenders go head-to-head on national television.
The Eagles defense (and the refs) stood tall in taking down the Dolphins, who saw a much improved play from their defense, but as the trade deadline approaches all NFL journalists, sports talk podcasts, and shows airing on national TV and every sports streaming platform are focused on which players will be switching teams.
The Dolphins will have an influx of talent coming back to action in the coming weeks, such as Xavien Howard, Jalen Ramsey, Connor Williams, Terron Armstead, and De'Von Achane.
However, there are still some needs along the offensive line, and in areas of the defense, some of which can be addressed at the trade deadline.
Chase Young
Probably not the first name that comes to mind when thinking of needs for the Dolphins, but the struggles of the defensive line in getting consistent pressure with their front four has been a talking point all season.
CBS Sports’ Josina Anderson reports that “several identifiable teams” are prepared to pull off a trade for Young or Montez Sweat from the Commanders, and while it may seem unlikely that Young will land in Miami, it's certainly something that should be, at the very least, explored.
First, Emmanuel Ogbah has been ineffective this season, collecting just 2.5 sacks on the season, a far cry from the 9 sacks he had in both the 2020 and 2021 seasons (prior to injury).
To be fair, the likes of Christian Wilkins have not played to their expected level, and the line as a whole has struggled.
Trading for Young, who is five years younger and has 5 sacks this season, would be a massive upgrade for the Dolphins.
It must be mentioned that trading for Young would lead to an immediate need to sign him to a long-term extension. Miami is certainly going to have some serious questions and decisions to make regarding their cap situation in the future, but if they were willing to sign Indianapolis Colts running back Jonathan Taylor to a lucrative contract, they certainly could do so with Young, and perhaps it may be a bit cheaper.
Bringing Young to a rush that includes Wilkins, Zach Sieler, Jaelen Phillips, and Bradley Chubb would certainly boost the line's potency as they prepare for a playoff push.
Miami has struggled generating sacks this season, so adding Young would go a long way into boosting that number, and helping other areas of the defense as well.
