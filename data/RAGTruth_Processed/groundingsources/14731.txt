Not a lot of money, but charging extra for leaving the cheese OFF and adding spinach to my omelette is not customer-friendly.  I didn't ask for an addition - I asked for spinach instead of peppers, and held the cheese.  It would seem that this is a win-win.  Whatever their reason, they're shooting themselves in the foot when other, busier establishments are willing to accommodate.  We eat breakfast out often, and enjoy Farmer Boy, Cody's, Breakwater, and Chad's regularly.  ALL of them are happy to substitute without nickel-and-diming customers."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2022-01-02 01:33:28", "review_text": "COVID REVIEW!\n\nI have been golfing at the golf course and having a couple beers after the round for many years and it had always been fine.\n\nNow they clearly do not give a damn about public health. They have the mask required to enter signs at the doors but NONE of the employees wear masks. I mentioned that it is the law and they said I didn't have to wear a mask if I didn't feel like it? Sorry but that is bull pucky. It is a small town and I am aware that the owners are Trumpers and they must not really give a damn if we ever get past this pandemic. If you do not want to go to a restaurant the is not following the public laws stay away from this place. On the other hand if you are a \"Let's go Brandon\" kinda person, you will feel right at home.\n\nI will contact Public Health Dept. but I suspect there are a lot of places like this these days. I hope they are able to do something about it but not holding my breath (just wearing a good mask)."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-21 20:31:31", "review_text": "I am sorry to leave this review!\nI had the crispy chicken tacos. I did not appreciate the dead lettuce! The food was extremely bland. I had to add jalape\u00f1os for flavor! \nMy friend on the other hand, ordered the omelette. She said it was a 3/5.\nFood arrived cold. Maybe that was a Dasher issue. The containers in which the food arrived, was flimsy, and falling apart."}]}
