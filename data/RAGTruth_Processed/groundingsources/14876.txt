Jeremy and his partner Sayward are very welcoming and have so much to teach. I had never seen many of the varietals in the wines they serve here - a true lesson in wine tasting!  I just let Jeremy pick for me and was totally satisfied. They are open thurs-sat 5-10pm. Sort of hidden off of Ortega street.  AND they serve delicious house wines for $5.25/glass - uncommon in SB!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2017-01-14 02:17:00", "review_text": "What a perfect little gem!! Love the old world wines, and the chickpea pancake is to die for! Off the beaten path a bit, and do worth the one block stroll from state street! A new favorite for me!\n\nAnd please try the warm cashews. They are so fantastic and perfectly seasoned."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-12-02 05:22:24", "review_text": "This is my new favorite spot to meet up with some friends for a drink. It's the perfect match of great food and drinks, that don't take themselves too seriously, and don't come with a hefty price tag. Pacific Crepes by day, 5 & 1/4 by night, their old world wine selection pairs well with the classic french decor of the daytime restaurant. I have to say that Jeremy and Seyward are two the nicest hosts you can find in the service industry, with a welcoming depth of knowlege that will get you excited about tasting through their meticulously curated list. Make sure to try the popcorn, which has a new recipe every week (Jeremy takes his popcorn seriously), and the house wine is only $5.25, which is the best deal in town (really good wine). I'm so excited to have found this place, and I suggest making this your next go-to spot for a weekly meetup with good friends, or a sweet little date spot. And don't miss out on their cidre selection!!!"}]}
