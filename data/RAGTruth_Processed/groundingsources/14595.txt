Great location right on Pardall. You can easily people watch and hang out for long periods of time if you want! They get sandwiches out so quick and you can really customize an order to get exactly what you want. I also love their French fries. The #14 is excellent and you can choose from several different sizes of sandwiches. So good!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-31 21:02:48", "review_text": "I can't speak to their other food but their cheesesteak really sucked. \n\nIt may technically be called beef but it's definitely not steak! It's a pre-cooked, pre-processed sandwich meat that is closer to pastrami than steak.\n\nThe onions were barely cooked and still tasted more like raw than sauteed. \n\nThere was one chunk of cheese in the middle of the sandwich.\n\nSo they failed at the 3 main ingredients of a cheesesteak sandwich. At least the bread tasted like bread."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-10-19 22:46:56", "review_text": "Good sandwiches, but because of PopPay's $5 off deals, they raised everything by over $2+... $10 for a 6 inch Turkey, Avocado and Cheese sandwich is such a rip off! Definitely only come if they have Poppay deals, any other time you might as well make your own sandwich! TL;DR: great tasting sandwiches, but definitely way too expensive"}]}
