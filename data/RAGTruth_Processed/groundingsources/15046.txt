Thankfully my brother found out about this holiday pop-up and made reservations way ahead of time (I believe in November prior to Thanksgiving) for four of us to check it out.  It was a perfect thing to do on Christmas Eve! Although it was crowded, the drinks were great and the company even better.  I tried two drinks, Elfing Around and the Yippie Ki Yay Mother F****r!!!  Both drinks were super appealing and enjoyable.  I love the uniquely themed names they came up with and that you can purchase holiday mugs; very cute!  I have a feeling this will become a great holiday tradition for my family and myself, while I'm optimistic they will be back next year! Fingers crossed..."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-12-19 05:45:18", "review_text": "I've now tried 5 of the cocktails at different times, and while the atmosphere was great, the cocktails were either too sweet or had an odd combination of flavors. Honestly if they put regular drinks in fun glasses, I would have liked it better. I wanted to like the place more, but each time I was disappointed by expensive, bad cocktails."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-19 03:43:03", "review_text": "I would HIGHLY recommend making a reservation at Miracle during this holiday season. The atmosphere and energy at this bar is contagious and gets everyone in the holiday spirit! \n\nFirst off, I would encourage anyone wanting to come here to get a reservation! From what I have heard they only allow reservations although MAYBE if it's a slow night you can come in on a walk in, it's just a risk! If anything, try and call in before to make sure there is availability for your party. \n\nAll of the servers here are not only extremely friendly and full of holiday spirit, they are extremely efficient and make sure to take care of their tables. The drinks were festive and fun. If you like traditional drinks with a twist I would recommend the old fashioned. The \"Elfing Around\" was a my favorite drink, it was a sparkling drink with a bit of gin and a mulled wine reduction. This drink was super fun and festive yet light and not too rich. \n\nThe atmosphere is what you are really paying for, it is pretty expensive for their cocktails, but the Christmas decor and music is a lot of fun and worth the experience. \n\nDefinitely check Miracle out if you are able to!"}]}
