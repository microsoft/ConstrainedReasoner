The service and food were all top class. They brought in a grill and mesquite charcoal grilled the carne asada and pollo. The tortillas were hand-made on site. The salsas were fresh. The vegetarian tacos had everyone asking for more. The portions were perfect for the size of the party including a little extra for the next day. Ruben knows how to plan for the event. They also brought in tables, plates, everything, and were great about cleaning up on the way out. I've been in to the the shop a few times and the attention to detail always shows. Thank Ruben!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-03-08 19:52:55", "review_text": "Don't hesitate to try this place! Amazing food and friendly and fast service!
