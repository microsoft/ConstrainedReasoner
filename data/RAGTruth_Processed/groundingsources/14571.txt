My potatoes were really burnt though. I asked for a iced mocha but the lady said the espresso machine was off already and she couldn't  turn it back on?? Ok anyway food was ok but the customer service was horrible. The lady acted like she was in a rush and there was only another couple there in the entire cafe! And when I went to pay she just threw the money at me maybe she got mad I used my axxess card bc she threw that also. Couple more I would like to try on the menu but I don't think I will be back due to bad hospitality"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2015-06-03 15:59:00", "review_text": "Now called Terraza Cafe and owned by different people, it is certainly not the same as Steve's Patio.  We had an uncomfortable visit -- seating is limited, it's loud, and the food, while satisfactory (nothing special), came with some unprofessional service.  First, they put the macademia nuts on the wrong order of pancakes (on my plain instead of my husband's banana pancakes), and rather than simply bringing a side to the table to add to his stack (let alone bothering to ask me if I WANTED or could eat nuts!), they expected us to scrape them from mine to his.  Fine - we did it, but it was clear they were too cheap to bring more to the table or redo the order.  But they also forgot to bring me any syrup, and when we asked for \"more syrup\" (I had used my husband's), apparently they brought the \"real maple\" syrup to the table for me, for which they charged us extra on the bill!!  When we brought this to their attention (that I never received any syrup to begin with, didn't expect \"real maple\" syrup, and wouldn't pay extra since pancakes should come with syrup!), they became disgruntled, suddenly unpleasant and passive aggressive toward us -- clearly not remembering they had messed up the order (no apologies for that, by the way).  Finally, they tried to take away my plate before I was finished, so I stopped them, but we weren't as quick when they took away the hashed browns we were still eating!!  Geez.  We will never return and we don't recommend this place -- they don't realize that an extra dollar spent to make up for their mistakes (on extra nuts and some maple syrup) and an accommodating, apologetic attitude are the best investments in future business!"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2015-04-22 17:52:21", "review_text": "From the reviews I expected this place to be a lot better than it was.  The food was pretty standard breakfast food.  Nothing special.  I do like that I was able to bring my dog on the patio (I think that was the only reason I chose it), but the patio area was very small to what I expected as well. Expect a wait if you want to sit on the patio."}]}
