Only the main waitress and cashier were wearing their mask.  \n\nBy contrast, the huge kitchen staff of The Lark next door are fully masked - no loose masking, no noses poking out, and absolutely no masks simply pulled down, like the staff at Lucky Penny."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2022-01-02 18:23:29", "review_text": "In a town with not too many pizza options I'd go running to, Lucky Penny is most likely a top contender. \n\nCrust airy, chewy, yet crispy (does that even make sense) and interesting toppings each time, Lucky Penny is a great place to grab some easy, casual pizza in the beautiful Funk Zone. They usually rotate certain pizzas, so be sure to check the menu before committing to go! \nEach pizza is unique, but most certainly not for everyone. \n\nDownsides? As good as this pizza joint is, they have pretty limited option, the price for the size of the pizza is overpriced, and the crust can definitely come out burnt on some occasions. It's for sure a place I would offer as an option if in the area, but never go out of my way to run back to."}]}
