I made a wedding cake for the daughter of a very close High School friend and the Fondant I bought (FondArt) was horrible.  I spent about 7 hours kneading it and rolling it, and no matter what I did when I covered a tier of the cake it cracked.  I was so stressed that decided to go to Montecito Confections to see if I could buy Fondant there.  I got there and asked Katie Teall the sweet adorable, British owner if she could help me.  she explained that she sold the store and the rest of her Fondant was for the last 15 wedding cakes that she had to deliver during the summer.  She must have seen my face of stress, exhaustion, just lost, and asked:  How big is your cake?  I told her and she said:  Do you want me to cover it in Fondant for you?  I jumped to hug her and kiss her and hug her and kissed her some more.\n\nI came home and the mother of the bride carried the bottom tier and we went back to Montecito Confections to be saved by Katie.  We arrived and she said where is the rest of the cake?  I did not want to take advantage so we just took the biggest tier.  She said:  Bring it!\n\nHome we went after hugging Katie and kissing her some more and got help and left with two more tiers.  Katie my angel covered the three tiers!!! She was my angel.  The mother of the bride broke in tears, I guess she was worried that I was never going to serve the wedding cake.  These were tears of relief!  We ended up having the most beautiful cake and thanks to Katie.  Katie also build the cake, putting all three tiers together.  Then explained to me how to decorate it.  She told me to get a photo of the container of her fondant because she had tried all the different brands and that was the best of them all.  She said that mine was impossible to work with since it was too dry!  Katie is a walking ANGEL.  I love her, love her and love her.  All the kisses and hugs are not enough to thank her for saving the wedding cake and so much more."}]}
