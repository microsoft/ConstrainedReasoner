{"question": "difference between tobiano and overo", "passages": "passage 1:Tobiano is generally a large patch of clearly lined color on a white coat. The white will cross the topline between the wither and the tail. Generally tobiano's have a dark colored face and stockings or socks, though overo's can have them too if they have the sabino gene. Many tobiano colored horses also have dual colored tails.\n\npassage 2:Paint horses come in two basic patterns, tobiano and overo.* Both of these patterns can be predominatly white or color. Tobiano:Solid color head with any combination of star, \u2026strip, blaze, snip. Commonly have white hair over the spine somewhere between the withers and dock. Commonly have four legs with some white hair, many times over the knees and hocks. Commonly have two-toned tails.\n\npassage 3:A common misconception is that if the white markings cross the center of the back, between the withers and the tail, then it is a tobiano, if not, it\u2019s an overo. This is simply not true. Many minimally marked tobianos do not have white that crosses the back, and many overos (especially splashed white overos) do.\n\n"}
