(Photo courtesy of USCIS). Immigration has shaped the United States as a nation since the first newcomers arrived over 400 years ago.\n\npassage 2:Prompt: What were the long-term economic, social, and political effects of Reconstruction? The United States was challenged with many issues after the Civil War like crop lien work contracts, segregation, and unresolved problems with the seceded states. This period was called Reconstruction. After the Civil War, African Americans were free but with no place to live in or to work at, they settled with their former \u2018masters\u2019. African Americans were technically free, but no one wanted to hire a colored man, so they were put on crop lien work contracts.\n\npassage 3:The War also, for the first time, brought economic unity to the US. The South joined the market system, abandoning their former semi-subsistence economy. Industrialization and large economic enterprises clearly had arrived to stay. Politically, important changes had accompanied the maintenance of the national unity.\n\n"}
