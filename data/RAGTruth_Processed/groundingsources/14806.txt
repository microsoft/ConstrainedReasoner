The food isn't very good, the drink options are in the C range, and the dive bar charm is largely gone. I'm not sure who the target audience is, but it seems like they don't know either."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-02-10 23:31:21", "review_text": "Doors are closed! Al Rojas (the owner) apparently didn't even have the class to inform the employees, just locked the doors and left. He owns Alcazar and Milk and Honey in town also. My wife and I have lived here all our lives (54 & 53 yrs.) and that's not Santa Barbara style business practice. Not deserving of getting local business in the other locations."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2016-01-14 20:16:33", "review_text": "This place has a decent feel and the food is really good. The staff was generally pretty decent save for the slovenly bartender who was a least 3 times drunker than any of the paying customers and the other bartender who ordered food off of my tab and proceeded to share it with the entire bar without my permission. The portion of my food that I was able to eat was very good though. I would not take anyone here who I was trying to impress but this is really not a bad place to relax and enjoy some Santa Barbara overpriced drinks."}]}
