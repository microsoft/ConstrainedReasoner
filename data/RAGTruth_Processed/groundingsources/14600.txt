We had the kumamoto oysters, uni shooter, clam chowder, lobster and scallop & shrimp linguini.  Everything tasted good and fresh! We went there on a weekday close to 3PM so there was no line, but I can understand how this place gets busy on peak hours and weekends!  They serve fresh quality seafood!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 22:25:47", "review_text": "Location is unique. Worth it. \n\nFood was good. With it. \n\nour server was Emma.

One cannot argue with a beachfront view. \nService was fast.\nTaste and cost do not match. \nI ordered a two pound dungeoness crab for 85.90 , no tax and tip. Fine, I was by the beach front. Ok, I get it. Now, let us taste it: Crab was over boiled. No special or secret sauce to make it more chichi to justify the cost . Just 2 onion rings , a wedge of lemon , lime and about 5-10ml of lemon butter. How basic can you get?\nPlease get a little bit creative.\nSo I looked at the lobster roll, the bread was not hot which is how it was supposed to be to complement the cold lobster. Now,  this gets more disappointing, the lobster meat looked mashed or ground and dry . It tasted like imitation crab and it tasted like it has been refrigerated for 3-5 days. There are No lumps or chunks. This is $32.95. How can you do this to the lobster roll? I wish they could have focused on the lobster roll rather than add the coleslaw and onion ring to it.I could order a separate coleslaw and onion ring if I wanted them. I could have a tuna sub and pass it as a lobster roll in this place. \nNow, I asked for sea urchin. This is the saddest part. They ran out.\nI ordered coffee. Make that 2 please. I can call it a day.\n\nI think I paid more for the real estate than the food.\nLocation, location, location. \nI think my hubby should stop following the food blogger.\nI would rather follow the yelp reviewers."}]}
