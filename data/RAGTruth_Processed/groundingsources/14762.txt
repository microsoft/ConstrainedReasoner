Plus ... (CONTROVERSY) ... pizza man Dan's has better ranch dressing. I never thought I'd say that about any place... also, their pizza tastes like pizza. If I wanted a frozen pizza... I'd just buy one and make it myself. Pizza Man Dan's is worth the delivery fee. Their toppings are fresh and their cheese seems to be actual cheese that follows the laws of physics/chemistry when warm. It melts. Pizza Man Dans has replaced the old, trust 564-111."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-10-07 02:42:18", "review_text": "Terrible customer service despite making our pizza wrong.
