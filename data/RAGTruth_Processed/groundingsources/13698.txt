Apparently they were having issues with their reservation system so they weren't sure where to seat us. Initially the hostess told us she could sit us up stairs but we'd have to order at the bar. Then she switched things up and sat us at a long table but it was super crowded so we tried upstairs. We quickly abandoned that as it didn't seem like it would be enjoyable. We decided to leave. As we were leaving the other person waiting on a table because of a messed up reservation was sitting at a table downstairs. Not really sure why we weren't offered that table or the other empty one we saw. It was a playoff game day so I understand that they were busy but I got the impression they were a complete mess not ready to handle that many people. My wife did say the food looked good. Maybe we'll try again next time where in SB."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-13 02:19:51", "review_text": "For being a sports bar, this place gets 5 stars for location, classiness, affordability, and excellent service. You can really sense that they work as a team here; the host, server, and busboy were all gracious and attentive. The food was surprisingly affordable and tasty. I was expecting greasy bar food, but they also have salads, brussel sprouts and an affordable salmon dish. Two appetizers, a sparkling rose, chicken Cesar salad and an entire salmon meal ended up being around $80+tip. \n\nI loved the gas fireplace on each outdoor table that pumped out heat, and I loved the sound of the water overlooking the turtle pond. I felt so happy resting and dining here, it is a quiet and quaint spot off State Street."}]}
