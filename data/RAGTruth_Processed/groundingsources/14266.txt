Penelope is so nice. \n\nI had the tropical shave ice flavored with Pi\u00f1a colada and blood orange. Yummy.  Perfect on warm days.\n \nThere's several benches to sit and people watch.  $3 for a shave ice- great deal.  Large portion you might want to share. For another $1 you can get vanilla ice cream at the bottom.  Enjoy."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-08-20 01:09:41", "review_text": "I ordered the Rainbow, which had pineapple and blue raspberry flavor, and it was delicious. I even added ice cream at the bottom which enlightened the whole treat! Very clean and sanitary with a lovely lady running the booth. Also the fact that an International Harvester Scout 2 was pulling the trailer made me enjoy my cold treat by tenfold"}]}
