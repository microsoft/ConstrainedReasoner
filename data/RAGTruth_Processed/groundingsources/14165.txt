They really could put in more effort to make this a great cafe. But I guess the university knows that this is the only eatery on this side of campus so why bother? \n\nI had an average chicken panini. Strangely, it was on a hamburger bun, but the quality of the bun was actually very good, so I really enjoyed that. The rest of the burger was just meh. \n\nI ordered a side salad and soda combo with my sandwich. The salad was fresh and tasty. The vinaigrette could have been better. It was very thick and way too tart. \n\nI'll probably stick to the options in the UCEN or just head to IV. Or just bring my own lunch from home..."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2019-01-25 02:04:35", "review_text": "This is basically a knockoff Panda Express (but less salty) and a knockoff Caribou Coffee, inside a knockoff 7-11 featuring the world's largest selection of Guayaki Yerba Mate, on a remote corner of campus. In one way, it's an ungodly turducken of a cafe, but in another way it's everything you could ever need. Your choice.\n\nAlso, the lady who runs the Chinese food shop is quite lovable, as is the quiet bamboo courtyard outside."}]}
