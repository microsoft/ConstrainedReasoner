Study: A simple mouth rinse test can confirm early signs of heart diseases
A recent study by Canadian researchers suggests that high levels of white blood cells in saliva could serve as an early warning sign of cardiovascular disease. While white blood cell counts are a known measure of oral inflammation, the researchers believe their findings could lead to a simple mouth rinse test to assess the risk of heart disease routinely.
The study involved 28 healthy young adults aged 18 to 30 who rinsed their mouths with tap water and provided saliva samples for white blood cell count after fasting for at least six hours. The researchers conducted various tests to evaluate the participants' heart disease risk, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), resting blood pressure measurements, flow-mediated dilation assessments, and ultrasounds to measure artery stiffness.
The results showed that elevated white blood cell counts in the participants' saliva were associated with less healthy arteries and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, lower flow-mediated dilation, an early indicator of poor arterial health, was significantly linked to higher white blood cell counts in saliva.
The researchers suggested that oral inflammation might affect the arteries' ability to produce nitric oxide, a gas that relaxes and widens blood vessels, thereby impacting blood flow. While this study was small, oral health could indicate heart function at any age.
The findings highlight the potential importance of addressing oral health as a part of cardiovascular health. The researchers believe a mouth rinse test could be easily implemented in clinical settings, such as family doctor or dentist visits, to assess oral inflammation and heart disease risk.
Maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups are already recommended for overall health, and this study underscores the potential benefits of these practices. The researchers plan to expand their study population further to explore the relationship between oral inflammation and cardiovascular health.
Cardiovascular disease remains one of North America's leading causes of death, and early detection and intervention are crucial in preventing its development and progression.
