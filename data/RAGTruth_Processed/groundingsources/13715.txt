Their food is delicious, plentiful and healthy--exactly what young athletes need. Owner, Paul Freeman, helped me make selections from their menu--not easy because there are so many great choices--and he personally delivered the food.  It arrived fresh and steaming hot.  We fed 60 people with ease, and everyone raved about the food.  Many thumbs up!!!"}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2015-11-30 18:19:48", "review_text": "To start out, I want to let you know I first emailed this establishment directly asking if they could give me an explanation. Six days later I have not heard from them...\n\nAt 5:47 pm last Saturday I called to make a delivery request. The call was answered and I said \"I would like to place a delivery\" a younger man said \"Do you mind if I put you on hold\". I was placed on hold for 6 minutes, which really isn't that horrible except the music is just one 5 second rift on repeat, making it dreadful. When I was taken off hold a woman told me that you did not take delivery requests over the phone anymore and I needed to go thru SB Menus. Which is fine, but why didn't the guy tell me that at the beginning before being on hold?\n\nI placed my order through SB menus. At 6:52 (beauty of cell phones, they record everything) the same woman called me back and said that you were out of chicken. She was not apologetic about it at all. I was flabbergasted, first I wait on hold then I go through SB Menus then wait over an hour to be told there are no chickens? Why wasn't that known when I placed the order?\n\nTo further add to my frustration the SB Menus delivery guy calls me and said he had been waiting 25 minutes and people had been coming in picking up take out chickens. And, he said they sent him away and he saw chickens still there?! What!? That is impossible right, why would they say there were no chickens when there were?\n\nSo if that isn't enough of a bad experience I went on my credit card  and was changed, by Freemans Chicken, not SB menus the full amount of an order I never got!\n\nBot sure how the food is, since I never got it but the customer service is awful!"}]}
