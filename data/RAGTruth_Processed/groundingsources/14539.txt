They are located in the same business center, so you can order empanadas to enjoy while you are at BrewLab or Apiary. We texted the number and chef came over to talk to us about the empanadas and brought our food right to us. \nWe ordered the Criolla, jamon y queso, Americana and fugazetta. \nAll four were absolutely delicious! \nWith how crispy the shell was you would swear they were fried but they are baked! \nDo not be taken back by the contents of the criolla, they marry well together and the zesty chumichurri is a great compliment to all of the empanadas. \nIf we weren't headed to a hotel for the night we would definitely get some frozen to go! \nDefinitely worth a try and you will not be disappointed!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-20 04:39:42", "review_text": "Loved these empanadas. We got 3 kinds, the prosciutto,  the blue cheese with pecans and the mozzarella with oregano. Everything was so tastey and full of flavor, including the chimichurri. Brought our empanadas over to the brewery next door as a snack to share with our beer flight and it was a perfect pairing. I especially loved the blue cheese empanada, I'm just disappointed I never thought to make something like this myself,  I'm inspired!  I will go back to try more soon."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-21 04:49:32", "review_text": "Sublime empanadas in a hidden gem of Carpinteria.
