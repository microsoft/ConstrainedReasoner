We had a wonderful waitress named AnaKay wait on us and she was fantastic. The food had great presentation and was delicious.  A party of 8 and all had great food. The the Margheritas were excellent!  Finally, if you dont have great chips and salsa, I dont come back to the place, but at Alitos, they do everything  well!  You wont be disappointed at this place."}]}
