It is visually very charming in Montecito, however the food was not. I had the pollo parmigiana. The cherry tomato salad was delicious atop of the chicken parm, but the chicken was just ok. Beto had tagiatelle with meat sauce and added meatballs. The sauce had a weird after taste and the meatballs were undescribeable....not in a good way. Moral of the story....don't listen to coworkers."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2011-09-17 20:15:33", "review_text": "Nice place but overrated.

Has anyone noticed that about 4 years ago the food became terrible? I just heard they are closing and don't wonder why...hopefully a new owner (LaFond) will create a venue worthy of the location and ambiance. If you go have some bread and wine from teh generous bartender but hold off on ordering food!"}]}
