{"question": "how do butterflies eggs live through winter", "passages": "passage 1:Most butterflies that live in cold climates spend the winter as caterpillars, while almost as many spend the winter as pupas. A few species, mainly tortoiseshells (Nymphalis) and anglewings (Polygonia), spend the winter as adults, hibernating in holes in trees, in crevices in man-made structures, or in other shelters.\n\npassage 2:Most butterflies that live in cold climates spend the winter as caterpillars, while almost as many spend the winter as a chrysalis. A few species spend the winter as adults, hibernating in holes in trees, in crevices in man-made structures, or in other shelters. A very few species spend the winter as eggs.\n\npassage 3:Some enter diapause, freeze, and live through temperatures well below 32 degrees F. Butterflies spend winter in different ways, depending upon the species. Many species convert glycogen to sorbitol and glycerol (nature's natural anti-freeze) as nights become longer and temperatures become cooler.\n\n"}
