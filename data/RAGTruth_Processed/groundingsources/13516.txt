$8.6 Million State Grant Awarded for Migrant Support to One Chicago Suburb Sparks Outrage in City
Chicago city officials and residents shocked by $8.6 million state grant to provide housing and services to asylum seekers in Joliet
An $8.6 million state grant designated to provide housing and services to asylum seekers in the Chicago suburb of Joliet has ignited controversy. City officials and some residents expressed surprise over the funding announcement made by Gov. JB Pritzker's office.
The grant was intended to facilitate shelter, food, legal support, healthcare, and various services for newly arrived migrants from Central and South America. However, the controversy stems from discrepancies in the grant application process. Some individuals listed as supporters on the application claimed they had not given their approval. Instead, the grant request was submitted by Joliet Township Supervisor Angel Contreras. Notably, the township is an independent government entity separate from the city.
In response to the dispute over the grant application, Joliet Park District Director Brad Staab revealed that the district had revoked a 6-month lease with the township for the Hartman Recreation Center. The lease, valued at $15,000 per month, was rescinded as the district believed the township had misrepresented the intended use of the facility. The district expected it to be used for recreational events and expanded community services, not as a migrant welcome center.
Amid the growing concerns, Joliet residents are planning to attend the township's regularly scheduled board meeting to discuss the issue. This meeting has been relocated to the Billie Limacher Bicentennial Park & Theatre to accommodate larger crowds.
"People in this community are very upset and concerned about what's going on with this grant, that nobody knew about except with the governor's announcement, which took everybody by surprise," stated John Sheridan, president of the Cunningham Neighborhood Council. Community activist Trista Graves Brown noted that individuals who typically wouldn't be engaged in such discussions have also expressed their concerns.
In response to media inquiries, Joliet Township officials defended their handling of the grant application process, emphasizing that it had been conducted appropriately. However, the controversy has escalated to the extent that a threat was made against a local social service agency that supports migrants, according to a Joliet City Council member.
Meanwhile, as Chicago continues to experience an influx of migrants, plans are underway to establish two new shelters on the West Side of the city. A community meeting will be held to address these developments.
