We weren't in a huge rush, but we didn't have hours to dine, because I had dough proofing at home and needed to attend to it. Hubby walked in and checked in with waitress and came out saying we should take any seat we wanted and she'd be right out with menus. So, we sat next to the Xmas tree on the patio and waited... and waited... and waited.\n\nWe figured she couldn't see us so we moved right next to the front door, where she couldn't miss us. After waiting several minutes, I decided we would wait 5 more minutes and then find somewhere else for dinner. After 3 minutes, a 30-something brunette waitress came and dropped off menus. I let her know the table was wobbly and she said she'd bring a block for it (which she never did). Oddly, I detected a twinge of attitude from the waitress with that exchange... not sure why, but there was an element of nastiness in her tone. She also turned on the table-side heater, which was very effective, if somewhat atmosphere-killing, because of its very bright coils.\n\nI pulled up Yelp to look at the pics of the entrees and we settled on what we wanted to order. After about 5 more minutes, the waitress returned and informed us that dinner would take longer here than other restaurants. I let her know I was proofing dough at home and if we ordered immediately, how long would it take. She replied that if we ordered faster, the food would come faster. (Duh! Crazy how that works!) Again, a twinge of nastiness.\n\nHubby and I heard the specials and I asked her to repeat the sides on one of the specials. Attitude was ramping up from her. I asked her what her favorite item on the menu was and she replied, \"I can't say. You're the one who's going to eat it, not me! The chef wouldn't even tell you.\" \n\nI didn't dare ask another question, because she was in full beeeyatch mode. We both ordered off the regular menu. Then, she said it would be 20 minutes and we ordered wine. Before she left, I asked the waitress if she could please ask the chef not to hold the entree until we finished the appetizer... just to put it all in at once. Her response? \"The chef doesn't need to be micromanaged like that.\" And that, my Yelp friends, was my limit to the abuse I was going to take from this witch of a waitress.\n\nI smiled and said thank you, but we aren't going to stay. She said okay, opened the door, walked into the restaurant, and I could hear her behind me exclaiming with a groan as she entered, \"Oh my Gaaaaawwwdd.\"\n\nGood thing they're in a tourist zone, because Petit Valentien can have a fresh supply of customers the waitress can abuse. As for this local, I'd recommend one of our other many fine dining establishments and give this one a wide berth, if service is important to you.\n\nTwo last comments: First, we noticed the restaurant had a Help Wanted sign posted, looking for servers, which could hint that maybe the attitude starts at the top and they have a hard time keeping servers. Second, I noticed another one of the local Yelp Elite crew (and other reviewers) also commented on the rude and inattentive service here. Seems to be a trend and unfortunately, it was our unlucky turn to experience it tonight."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-10-08 16:53:58", "review_text": "Just don't go. They are severely understaffed and incredibly rude. We had to walk out after the waitress ignored us for about 15-20 minutes. We had to ask her three times to let us know what the wait time would be. Very unprofessional."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-02 22:38:26", "review_text": "Amazing experience with a variety of Ethiopian flavors giving it the right touch. A story in flavors you need to experience. Lovely location feels like your in another world.  \nGreat service."}]}
