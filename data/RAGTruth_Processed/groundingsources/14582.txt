However, I felt compelled to drop this review because last night our app order was lost in the ether & when my husband arrived to pick it up the place was packed, as usual.  They could have been dismissive, however they we effusively apologetic, made my husband comfortable at the bar, checked on him often, prepared our order promptly & then threw in their delectable chocolate mousse gratis for the delay.  This is a business you want to support."}]}
