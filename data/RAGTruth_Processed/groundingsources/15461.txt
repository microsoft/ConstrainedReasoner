{"question": "how do hsa plans work", "passages": "passage 1:With an HSA you can make tax-deductible contributions each year to pay for current and future health care costs. What you don't use in any given year will stay invested and continue to grow tax-free, assuming you eventually pull it out to use for medical costs.\n\npassage 2:Your employer may also kick in a contribution. If you have an HSA on your own, you still get the tax break; you just claim the contribution as an above the line deduction on your tax return, and your taxable income will be reduced by the amount of your contribution. What's more, just about anyone can contribute to your HSA: spouses, parents, even friends.\n\npassage 3:An HSA works in conjunction with high deductible health insurance. Your HSA dollars can be used to help pay the health insurance deductible and qualified medical expenses, including those not covered by the health insurance, like dental and vision care. Any funds you withdraw for non-qualified medical expenses will be taxed at your income-tax rate, plus 20% if you\u2019re under 65. Once you meet the calendar-year deductible, health insurance pays the remaining covered expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of your particular plan.\n\n"}
