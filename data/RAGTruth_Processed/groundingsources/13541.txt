A 16-year-old met a stranger in Georgia and five days later in 1978, her baby was gone.
The Heartbreaking Disappearance of Raymond Green Jr. from Atlanta, Georgia, in 1978
In a harrowing incident from 1978, a newborn was abducted, leaving a young mother devastated and a family torn apart for decades. Donna Green, who was just 16 at the time, gave birth to Raymond Green Jr. at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 1st. It was a joyous occasion as Raymond Jr. was the coupleâ€™s second child, with their first daughter, Raymonda, born just a year prior.
However, the joy was short-lived. Donna was befriended by a woman named Lisa Morris at the hospital. This woman claimed that her sister had recently given birth and expressed a keen interest in Donna's life and her newborn son.
After gaining Donna's trust, Lisa visited the Green residence on November 6, where she skillfully maneuvered her way to be left alone with baby Raymond. Seizing this opportunity, Lisa kidnapped the child. A witness spotted her entering a brown van holding a baby, which quickly drove off, marking the beginning of a heart-wrenching search.
Despite Donna's desperate attempts to locate her son, her pleas fell largely on deaf ears. According to Donna, her socio-economic status and racial background meant that her son's disappearance didn't garner the media attention or the urgency it deserved.
An investigation revealed that the mysterious 'Lisa Morris' had provided false information to Donna. Descriptions of Lisa paint her as a Black woman in her early 20s, about 5'6" tall, weighing 170 lbs, with distinctive scars on her forehead and a mole on her left cheek.
The emotional aftermath of this tragedy was significant. Donna and her boyfriend, Raymond Green, drifted apart due to the blame game that ensued. However, love found its way back and the couple reconciled in 1990, expanding their family with five more children and enjoying the company of twelve grandchildren. Raymond Sr., however, passed away in 1999.
Raymond Jr.'s disappearance remains a gaping hole in Donna's heart. In her persistent search for answers, she has explored multiple avenues, including submitting her DNA to ancestry platforms in hopes of a familial match.
Recently, there's been a renewed effort to solve this 40-year-old mystery. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has released an age-progressed photo of what Raymond Jr. might look like today, and this image will be widely circulated across gas stations in the U.S.
For anyone with potential information regarding Raymond Green Jr.'s whereabouts, they are urged to contact the Atlanta Police Department at 1-404-658-6666. The hope remains that one day the Green family will find closure.
