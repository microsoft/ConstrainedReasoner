Phonograms are often referred to as word families. The words sunk, chunk, and trunk belong to the same word family because they contain the ending-unk.In these three words the ending-unk is a phonogram; it is also the rime. A relatively small number of phonograms can be used to generate a large number of words.Wylie and Durrell (1970) point out that nearly 500 primary-grade words can be derived from 37 \u201crhyming\u201d phonograms.honograms are often referred to as word families.
