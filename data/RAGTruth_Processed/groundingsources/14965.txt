Owner Patrick was working alone and kicking ass! I was wondering why the sandwiches were taking longer than I expected, but then I realized that the few single people before us were ordering multiple Sammys. No doubt the take out orders were rolling in too. Patrick still made time to chat with customers and hand out free samples of delicious charcuterie. While we were eating outside, he kept bringing us more samples. The meats and cheeses and bread were of the highest quality and my \"Italian style\" sub on a heavenly soft French roll was the best I've ever had. This coming from a private chef/food fanatic. Charming side note: this place has been here since 1973 and was handed down from father to son.  From what I've read, Patrick's father John was beloved in the community. Well known to Montecito locals but new to this Venturan, I will definitely be back to this hidden gem. Seating is limited but there's a pretty, grassy area in the shopping center that would make for a lovely picnic. Keep up the good work and good works Patrick, of charity and community involvement."}]}
