{"question": "how and when to harvest chestnuts", "passages": "passage 1:Properly stored fresh Chestnuts will feel hard as rocks if you squeeze them. Though our Chestnuts are quite sweet right out of the bag, due to our SECRET post harvest conditioning process, for best flavor you should dry them slightly. A unique aspect of Chestnuts is that they become sweeter as they dry.\n\npassage 2:Harvesting Chestnut Trees. After the chestnuts fall from the tree, watch for the spiny burs to split. Don\u2019t harvest chestnuts if the burs are still green and closed because the nuts inside will be unripe. Harvest the nuts every couple of days.\n\npassage 3:When to harvest chestnuts? Chestnuts don\u2019t ripen at the same time and chestnut harvest time can span as much as five weeks, although the nuts generally ripen in a 10- to 30-day span of time in late August and September. Allow the nuts to fall from the tree naturally.\n\n"}
