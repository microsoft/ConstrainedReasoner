The service is always great. We go there so often that some of the staff even remembers our orders. The food is always great. Pepe's has the best pozole in town! Highly recommend this place. We are excited to have dinner there once it reopens from renovations."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2020-10-31 00:00:17", "review_text": "I went there last Saturday and they had a wedding party there that was taking up all the kitchen workers time.  We had our order taken within a reasonable time frame and same with our drinks.  The waitress was good on keeping our drinks full but that was it.  After waiting for over an hour for our appetizer and food it still did not come.  We asked the waitress for our ticket and then left.  The waitress was friendly but couldn't give us an answer when our food would be coming.  We have been there before when they were closed because of a private party so am not why they didn't do that this time around."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-10-20 15:51:21", "review_text": "What a great place off the beaten path I stopped for diner and drinks.
