It brought the comforts of home away from home. You just got that vibe the instant you walked in. \n\nI loved that they made their own gelato. I had tried the caramelized banana, freaking amazing! \n\nI loved that everything on the menu was vegan and gluten-free. I had the quiche which was sooooo good! Where can you find a vegan quiche?!?! \n\nI loved that the decor was retro. It would have been the perfect date spot. \n\nAdama, it was love at first sight and bite. Please come back! Or open up elsewhere. I heard it was a bad location...\n\nThank you for reading this emotional review. I'm so sad."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2014-11-29 03:26:48", "review_text": "Service wasn't as bad as many of the reviews are saying.
