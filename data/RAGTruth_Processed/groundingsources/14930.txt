Denny's is a step above Waffle House which isn't saying much. I Hop has gone downhill but a step or two above Denny's which is not saying much.\n\nThe only good place to get breakfast in Santa Barbara is Jeanine's.  \n\nBest  in SBC is Ellen's Pancake House in Buellton about a 35 minute gorgeous ocean and scenic drive north up 101 just off the freeway.  \n\nThey are the best of the best in SBC.  Quality and amount of food is huge... prices fair.  Expect a line of people waiting to get a table or counter seat that are locals not tourists.  Prepare to go out for a walk or hike.  One doesn't go away hungry. Staff are fantastic and many have worked there for years.  Exceptional service. Unlike most breakfast lunch restaurants family owned and run onsite and cooks and servers that have worked there for decades.\n\nSeveral of our favorites are chicken fried steak and eggs with thick apple cured bacon bits added to gravy with homemade biscuits and gravy, NY steak and eggs, thick ham steak and eggs, 3, 6 or 12 egg omelettes made any way one likes.  Never, ever forget the thin Danish pancakes that can be ordered with fruit.  They are truly a delicacy and come with powdered sugar dusting.  Just a little butter and real maple syrup is all they need.  If one wants them a tad sweeter the preserves they offer will put it over the top.  Prepare for a to go box.  Local ranchers and farmers eat here for breakfast starting at about 6am as they need a hearty breakfast to make it to lunch or dinner."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-24 01:04:06", "review_text": "Kinda dumb to review a Dennys restaurant but the staff was really kind and the waitress woman \nworking in the morning was an older(40s-50s) woman but made the experience feel like an old diner, and she was working 5 tables all at the same time was wild to watch her work.  Like an old school San Francisco diner and food is great as always"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-10-16 06:52:35", "review_text": "The menu says that they serve soft boiled eggs but they do not serve soft boiled eggs.
