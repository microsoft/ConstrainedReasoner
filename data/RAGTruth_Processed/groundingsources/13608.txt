Service is friendly. Do be prepared to chill as is very laid back. Boyfriend and I both had the Caesar salad and the Huli Huli Chicken dish. AWESOME!! It was SO fantastic we couldn't stop thinking about it! Our neighbors (at the next table) were raving about how delicious their meals were too! Micro brews yummy! Highly recommend a visit here!
