Our driver was Kevin.  He was on time, polite and professional.  He was very accommodating to our needs.  We had a great time wine tasting and felt very safe.  I would 100% recommend this company.  Excellent customer service from the beginning to the end."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-09 01:40:13", "review_text": "Chris was our driver and he was great. I trusted him to drive my car, he knew his way around the area very well and made suggestions when we asked for his recommendations. He was familiar with all the wineries and suggested a new one we had a great time at. He was patient with us too! Lots of middle aged ladies in the car for two days!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-08-29 21:18:12", "review_text": "What a great service.  Chris responded almost immediately during scheduling.  Mitch was our driver and we thought he was perfect.  Super laid back and friendly but not overbearing.  We'd already planned our appointments but if you haven't, Mitch has a wealth of knowledge of the area and the winery options.  He is also an artist, so make sure to get his card and check out his website.  Thanks Chris and Mitch for 2 fantastic days!"}]}
