{"question": "difference between feha and ada", "passages": "passage 1:One difference between the FEHA (the Fair Employment and Housing Act) and the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) is that the ADA applies to all employers in the private sector that have four to fifteen employees, whereas the FEHA affects more employees, and it doesn\u2019t distinguish between private and public employers like the ADA does.\n\npassage 2:Class Description: This class is designed specifically for supervisors and managers to learn the basic provisions of the California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and understand their responsibilities during the reasonable accommodation process.\n\npassage 3:Probably one of the most important differences between the ADA and FEHA is that with FEHA, a disability is required. Under the ADA, to qualify for disability, a physical or mental impairment substantially limits a major life activity, but the FEHA requires only that a mental and physical disability limit a major life activity; not a substantial limit, but a limit.\n\n"}
