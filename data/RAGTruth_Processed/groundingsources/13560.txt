California Delivery Driver Filmed Eating Customer's Meal Before Delivery
In a shocking incident, a Grubhub delivery driver in California was filmed taking bites from a customer's meal and then delivering the partially-eaten food. The owner of Mexihanas Hibachi Grill, Martin Luzanilla, immediately recognized the wrongdoing after spotting the driver indulging in the order via surveillance footage.
Speaking to Nexstar affiliate KTLA in Long Beach, California, Luzanilla shared, "The moment I saw him devouring the food, I was appalled. He even tried to convince me that it was his meal when confronted." The surveillance video clearly depicts the driver hastily getting into his car, tearing the food bags open, and munching away. "Food was falling everywhere as he took large bites," Luzanilla added.
Though Luzanilla quickly attempted to alert the customer, it was too late as the half-eaten meal was already delivered. Determined to make it right, Luzanilla prepared a fresh meal and personally delivered it to the customer. As food delivery services like Doordash and Grubhub gain momentum, maintaining the quality and integrity of delivered orders is vital for restaurant owners. "Nearly 40% of our business comes from these apps. A bad review due to a delivery mishap can harm our reputation," Luzanilla expressed.
However, despite the disheartening incident, Luzanilla offered a heartwarming message to all delivery drivers. "If you're delivering for my restaurant and you're hungry, just let me know. I'll gladly provide you with a meal. There's no need to tamper with a customer's food."
Grubhub, responding to the incident, conveyed their commitment to maintaining professional standards. Their statement highlighted, "While most of our orders are executed flawlessly, we take immediate action if things go awry." Following the incident, the driver involved was promptly suspended, and Grubhub reached out to the affected customer to resolve the matter.
