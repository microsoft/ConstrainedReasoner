Hopping on the fried chicken sandwich trend, Habit really pairs the dish well with coleslaw and sriracha aioli (unlike Kyles Kitchen) that adds a vibrancy to the dish. The buns are also well made and nicely toasted, which is actually not common when ordering sandwiches / burgers at most places.\n\nTeriyaki Char - The pineapple and patty is too small apparently to be seen in the photo! The burger was overall good quality, all the fixins were why I ordered it to begin with, and then theres the patty that adds meat flavor but doesn't contribute anything substantially in terms of flavor, which is fine, considering it tasted decent. \n\nSweet Potato Fries - Their sweet potato fries are really good though, especially with a side of sriracha mayo! Only complaint is that it is very difficult to eat when served on such a small tray."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-23 06:38:01", "review_text": "Really pleasantly surprised with the $5 BBQ Bacon burger at The Habit! It was juicy, sumptuous, and worked very well with the balance between bbq sauce and mayo. The bun was toasted well, which added to the lovely texture of the bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. Overall, really pleasant and good burger!"}]}
