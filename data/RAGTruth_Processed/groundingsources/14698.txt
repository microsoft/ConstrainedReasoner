A must have at sachi!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-10 01:47:10", "review_text": "Been coming here again and again and am always left thinking about how delicious the meal I just had was. I usually go for the spicy miso chashu ramen, but every ramen I try is just as good. Rice bowls and spicy tuna roll is also very delicious. Best ramen shop in town no question. Only disappointment was that due to the lack of staffing, they are only doing takeout at the moment (1/9/22), so next time I'll be calling ahead."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2022-01-08 04:09:21", "review_text": "I've been coming here since they opened and am glad they have remained in business throughout the pandemic. I and always get the same thing: the Spicy Crispy Chicken Black Garlic Ramen. The broth is full bodied and very flavorful, and has a nice spicy kick to it but still mild for someone (like me) who likes super spicy things. One tip to get the most bang for your buck if you have leftover broth: if you have instant noodles or ramen/udon/etc at home, you can add it to the broth to get another delicious meal out of it. 10/10 highly recommended."}]}
