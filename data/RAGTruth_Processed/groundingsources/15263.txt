{"question": "what is solar power used for", "passages": "passage 1:You won't believe these 10 facts about people. Solar power is energy that is derived from the sun and converted into heat or electricity. It is a versatile source of renewable energy that can be used in an amazing number of applications, providing power for everything from cars and boats to houses and spacecraft.d. Energy from the sun can be converted into solar power in two ways. The first way involves the use of solar thermal applications. Solar thermal applications use the sun's energy to provide direct heat to air or liquid. Solar thermal panels can be used for both residential and larger-scale applications.\n\npassage 2:1 solar thermal: these systems convert sunlight into thermal energy (heat). 2  Most solar thermal systems use solar energy for space heating or to heat water (such as in a solar hot water system). 3  However this heat energy can be used to drive a refrigeration cycle to provide for solar based cooling. Most solar thermal systems use solar energy for space heating or to heat water (such as in a solar hot water system). 2  However this heat energy can be used to drive a refrigeration cycle to provide for solar based cooling.\n\npassage 3:Solar energy is energy which is created from sunlight, or heat from the sun. Solar power is captured when energy from the sun is converted into electricity or used to heat air, water, or other fluids.There are currently two main types of solar energy technologies:1  solar thermal: these systems convert sunlight into thermal energy (heat). 2  Most solar thermal systems use solar energy for space heating or to heat water (such as in a solar hot water system). Most solar thermal systems use solar energy for space heating or to heat water (such as in a solar hot water system). 2  However this heat energy can be used to drive a refrigeration cycle to provide for solar based cooling.\n\n"}
