Old meat!!! Yuck. And being in Santa Barbara, we generally are very generous with our comments due to the lack of good Asian food.  I just couldn't believe all the reviewers giving this place great reviews!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2011-02-08 00:14:21", "review_text": "I didn't really like Vietnamese food until about a year ago but I developed a taste for it, now I love it. This place is great. Service with a smile, attentive waiters and best of all great FRESHHHH food! I was going there too much and had to cut back."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2011-01-12 00:46:13", "review_text": "Having never had Vietnamese food before, I was a bit apprehensive about trying Saigon In and Out.  The restaurant was empty when we arrived so I was even more nervous.  My fears were quickly put to rest though.  The service was very fast and our server was very friendly.  The food was absolutley delicious too!!  My husband and I shared an appetizer of summer rolls which were great, and a sweet and sour chicken hot pot.  I can't wait to go back."}]}
