{"question": "risks benefits roth ira vs 401k", "passages": "passage 1:A Roth 401(k) account works much like a Roth IRA, but there is no income limit to participate, and you are required to take the minimum distributions that would be required from a Traditional IRA beginning at age 70\u00bd.There is also a Roth version of the 403(b) plan.gain, if you're able to save more after you put $5,500 in a Roth, continue with your 401(k) until you max it out. 1  If you're not eligible for either a deductible contribution to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA contribution, then just continue with your 401(k) until you've contributed the maximum allowed.\n\npassage 2:Contribution Limits. You can contribute up to $18,000/year to your Roth 401(k), as well as an additional $6,000 if you'll turn 50 by the end of the year. That number is much lower for Roth IRAs, which limit you to $5,500 a year or $6,500 if you're 50 or older. Here, the Roth 401(k) is the clear winner.or example, if you have both a Roth IRA and Roth 401(k) \u2013 and you're eligible to make contributions to both \u2013 your annual contribution maximum effectively becomes $23,500 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older). This round goes to the Roth IRA.\n\npassage 3:Another risk with Roth IRAs is that unlike a 401(k) , the IRS, not your employer, places limits on how much you can put into your retirement fund.You cannot contribute more than you make to your fund, and if you make too much money, you cannot open a Roth IRA.he main risk for opening a Roth IRA is that you do not get the same up-front tax break you get with a traditional IRA. A traditional IRA lets you put money aside before taxes, but the money you put into your Roth IRA goes into your account after your taxes are taken.\n\n"}
