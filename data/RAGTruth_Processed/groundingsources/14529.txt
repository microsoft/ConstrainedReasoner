And they don't seem to play together well. It's like a stupid TV show or movie where cohabitants draw a line in the middle of a room and pretend the other doesn't exist. Both are WIDE OPEN, and you can see one side from the other, but Topa is the focus when you walk in. We said we wanted a tasting, and they asked what beers we wanted. We said we were there for wine and were told the winery was next door.  We walked outside to walk around, but it was literally RIGHT THERE inside the same space and divided by a 3-foot wall.  Whatever. \n\nApparently, there is a liquor license issue, and there are very strict rules about beer and wine comingling.  Stupid, but again, whatever.  \n\nTo Fox Winery.  2 tastings offered. Fox Wines are $15 for 5 wine tasting /8 options. Blair Fox Wines are $20 for 5 tastes of 5 wines. \n\nOkay, we ordered one of each tasting. They were out of Savignon Blanc and GSM for first, so I opted for a Chardonnay and 4 Pinot Noirs.  The wife got the 5 'premium' pours. \n\nPours were one mouthful. I've never seen anything like it. A literal splash in the glass. ??  Seriously, it was a complete joke. \n\nOnly one other couple was in there, and the  woman that was 'rinsing' the glasses with wine managed to get mixed up with our tasting, poured wrong wines, and was just generally not present.  \n\nWe just decided to move on, cut our losses, and pay. She proceeded to charge us $36 for a $15 + $20 order. Not sure how THAT works out, but  NEVER again.  Waste of time and money. \n\nWines were mediocre with whites (Chardonnay and Vigonier) being undrinkable. Even if we got a legitimate taste, we'd have put them in the dpit bucket. \n\nTopa looked fun, but don't waste your time or money at Fox. Walk on by!"}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2022-01-17 00:40:59", "review_text": "Very disappointing.  We were looking forward to trying this new winery.  Will NOT be back.  I chose the Blair Fox tasting and my husband did the Fox & Co.  The temperature of the viognier was too warm.  The glass was cold, but wine temperature was warm which detracted from the presentation.  I don't think I have ever been to a tasting with smaller pours.  I know it is a tasting, but they should at least give you enough to taste.  Finally, the server kept confusing which wine we were on, mixed up my husband's wine, pored him mine, etc.  Some serious staff training needs to be done."}, {"review_stars": 2.0, "review_date": "2021-10-16 21:58:26", "review_text": "I arrived to Fox Wine on a Friday night at 9:20 pm, and the staff member said she had already done last call (They close at 10). She turned at least 6 people away and was not friendly. The last time I was there I was also rushed through my glass, and this same staff member said I needed to finish it within 15 minutes (I ended up returning the glass to her before they closed). I'm surprised that on a Friday night so many people were turned away way sooner than closing. I work in the industry, and I've never heard of last call being so early. It seems like it would be substantial business lost for a busy weekend in Santa Barbara."}]}
