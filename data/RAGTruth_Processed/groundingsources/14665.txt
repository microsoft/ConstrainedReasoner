I LOVE the new interior. Everything felt clean too. \n\nTheir sampler sizes were just the right size at 5 oz so I tried the...\n- vacation dad blonde ale (my fave)\n- festbier lager\n- hard cider\n- bourbon barrel stout (delicious!)\n\nMost beers are reasonably priced between $7-8. And the staff is friendly and welcoming. Great atmosphere! I'm looking forward to coming back when they have live band events."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-10-02 22:46:12", "review_text": "Looking for your new third place? Look no further. Centennial has a wide variety of beers on tap and on the shelves. The staff is more than helpful and good old fashioned friendly. They are knowledge about all the delicious flavor filled drops that will dance on your tongue.  Great atmosphere for a date or solo at the bar top with a talkative bar keep. Respectful, kind, genuine.  It's a place I recommend to everyone I meet."}]}
