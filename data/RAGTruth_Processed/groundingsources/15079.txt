Like, I had to place the same order with 3 different waitress , like really ? Plus I order the turmeric shoot and after 15 min waiting the waitress came back k to our table to tell us that they were out of it !"}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2015-09-14 05:52:48", "review_text": "Lovely setting. Order the buckwheat waffle, which consisted of two little waffles. They were very good but portion size petite. Hubby got the mushroom spinach omelette which was tasty. Due to the small portion sizes of entrees  we ordered a side of chicken sausage which was delicious and needed."}]}
