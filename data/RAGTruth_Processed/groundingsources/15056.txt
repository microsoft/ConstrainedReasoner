The app said lobby was open until 9pm.  I tried to go in at 8:50 PM.  Doors were locked.  Parked in front of the signs for online orders and checked in.  Waited for 20 minutes and nobody came out.  I decided to pull up to the drive thru window to let them know I had an online order.  The girl seemed puzzled and asked the other worker about it.  Other worker said \"all\u00ed est\u00e1\" meaning it is right there.  Who knows how long I would have had to wait if I wouldn't have drove up to the window.  Food's temperature was on the cold side.  Not very good service."}]}
