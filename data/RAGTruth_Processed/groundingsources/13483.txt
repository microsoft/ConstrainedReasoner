In 2012, a girl went to see her dad in Alabama. She disappeared and her dad won't say anything
Mystery Deepens as 14-Year-Old's Disappearance Remains Unexplained by Father in 2012.
Brittany Shante Robinson, a 14-year-old from Mobile, Alabama, was known for her affinity for reading and sketching. Excelling academically, she was placed in advanced classes and had built a positive rapport with her educators. Brittany lived with her mother, Tiana Hogue, while shared custody was maintained with her father, Demetric Lemond Hooper.
On June 14, 2012, Brittany was picked up by Demetric’s sister, Sierra Hooper, for a brief stay with her father, with a planned return on June 18th. To Tiana's alarm, that return never took place.
Initially, Tiana gave the benefit of the doubt, suspecting the trip might have been extended for a couple of days. But, as time stretched and neither Brittany nor Demetric reached out, her worry intensified. A short text from Demetric on June 20th promised Brittany’s return in an hour, but she never arrived. A later message from him claimed they were at a wedding and Brittany would be home soon.
However, Demetric's subsequent silence and the barren state of his apartment – as if it had been swiftly vacated – raised alarms. In the absence of any sign of Brittany and with Demetric's evasiveness, Tiana's concerns escalated.
Subsequent events led to a custodial interference warrant being issued for Demetric on July 26th. His whereabouts remained a puzzle until a tip led police to locate him in Arkansas at a research center. Oddly, he was participating in a trial for schizophrenia medication. Among his possessions were Brittany’s pink iPod and a puzzling rope.
Though Demetric received a 10-year sentence, he was released in 2016, continuing to ambiguously assert Brittany's safety but offering no concrete details of her location.
Brittany was last seen donning a pink floral blouse and blue denim. She suffers from asthma and was without her essential medicine during her visit. Any leads or pertinent details should be relayed to MPD at 251-208-1700.
