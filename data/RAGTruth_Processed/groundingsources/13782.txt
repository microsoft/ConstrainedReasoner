We are so glad our first choice fell through! \n\nThe owners were so nice and welcoming, and the food was amazing - we had something from the whiteboard in front - The Pi\u00f1ata Burrito. Not on the regular menu, and if it isn't on the whiteboard when you come, I'm sure they'll make it anyway - highly recommended!!\n\nWe showed up near the end of the night, other restaurants were closed or closing, and by that time they were running low on their bottled drinks - again, fate played a hand and she basically brought the few drinks that were left so we could choose, which forced us to try something new - some amazing flavors we wouldn't have thought to order otherwise - we have some new favorite sodas as of tonight!\n\nBack at the hotel now, feeling super contented. We'll be back!"}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2021-12-30 18:39:01", "review_text": "Ordered Chilequiles with Red Sauce and Al Pastor and Huevos Divorciados to go. Huevos Divorciados was perfect and delicious, but the Chilequiles came with green sauce instead and was missing the al pastor. Everything was delicious but sad about the mistakes in the order. Also green sauce was spicy."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-19 22:57:03", "review_text": "Walked In basically because it was across the street from my hotel. Asked the adorable husband and wife owners what was good and got the most amazing dish unlike any Mexican food I've ever had. I'm sure the rest of the menu is just as good - so much obvious love goes into the food."}]}
