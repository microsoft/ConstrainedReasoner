We had the following:\nFilet Steak Bite (Kashmiri almond sauce was the best!)\nCurried Fish Tacos (good but not enough spice for my taste)\nHummus and flat bread were delicious\nOnion Pakoras date tamarind chutney was a perfect balance\nNectar Fries tasty spices \nChili Lemongrass Shrimp (scampi sauce with a little kick was amazing)\nChicken kebabs tender and juicy, loved the flavor\n\nI will definitely keep coming back and different items and bring more friends. A really nice touch was that the owner Brad came around to say hi and check on food, drinks and service. We asked about his story and he told us about his experiences in the biz. It's great to see a locally owned restaurant doing well."}]}
