The owners care about doing it right and taking care of there patrons. Down to asking me \"How spicy do you want your spicy tuna?\"  I have never had someone be that thoughtful and they were happy to accommodate.  The rolls are huge and delicious, the fish is fresh, and if you are looking for excellent Udon you have try there's.  Shintori Sushi is forever on our Tuesday take-out short list."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-05-15 03:16:34", "review_text": "After 13 years of this being my \"neighborhood\" sushi place (and always busy), I finally ordered out some sushi. Delicious, fresh, great selection, reasonably priced. I can see why it is always packed. So far the best sushi I've had in Santa Barbara."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-05-03 18:59:20", "review_text": "Spent $75.00 on teriyaki beef and chicken combo and it was the worst Japanese food I've ever eaten.  They put sesame leafs diced on all their rolls overpowering the sushi flavor. They also put Mexican salsa over the teriuaki beef. I owned a Japanese Restaurant before and this was the worst Japanese fusion restaurant I've ever ate. Too much jinger on everything and no teriyaki sauce on teriyaki meat."}]}
