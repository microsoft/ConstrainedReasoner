{"question": "how to use a coinstar machine", "passages": "passage 1:Steps. 1  1. Collect change from around your home and car. 2  2. Clean the change if it is dirty at all. 3  3. Visit the CoinStar website at CoinStar.com to find out more about how to use CoinStar to donate to charity with helpful videos and instructions.  4. Enter your city or zip code in the top right corner of the CoinStar site to find the nearest machine.\n\npassage 2:From the main menu of the CoinStar machine, select the option to donate the coins to charity. 6. Place the coins into the slot of the machine. Lift up the handle at the side to empty more coins into the machine if some get stuck. 7. Wait for coins to be counted and for your receipt to print.\n\npassage 3:So that pretty much leaves me with only two options: let my change sit in a jar and lose out to inflation or take it to a CoinStar and pay a hefty 9.8% fee. Until recently, I chose the former. There\u2019s not a whole lot of use for change these days, casinos won\u2019t even take change in their slot machines anymore. I would rather let my money sit there idle than pay some company 10 cents on the dollar to count my money haha. Most of my readers should know by now that I hate fees!\n\n"}
