My boyfriend and I went today at exactly 5:00 and waited until 5:30 just to be able to walk inside, but never got the chance.  There was no sign of anyone and no answer when we called. The website, yelp, the answering machine message, and even the sign outside said that they were open from 5:00 to 11:00 on Sundays. It is Sunday, at 5:30 and I just wasted a half hour waiting for them to open, which they never did. So, I gave zero stars as one star would at least be given on default for opening the damn business. \nBasically, I find it disgraceful that a business lacked the integriy to even be open when they claim to be open. \nHopefully they open today at all. If not. They obviously get zero stars."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2015-06-29 05:58:19", "review_text": "It was a good experience BUT it was on the expensive side for hookah about $25/hookah which to me is a lot especially considering on the quality of hookah. The people were really nice and accommodating . Provably wouldn't come here again but a good experience since there aren't many hookah places around. Very lax and a pool table ."}]}
