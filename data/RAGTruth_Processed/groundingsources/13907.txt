Man's Body Was Mistaken For A Halloween Decoration, Gardener Thought He Was A Prop
A North Carolina family struggles to understand what happened to their loved one after discovering his body was mistaken for a Halloween prop. KSN reports that Robert Owens' body was found in China Grove and believed to be a Halloween decoration for days before someone discovered his body.
To make matters worse, the family learned that the gardener mowed around his body, believing he was part of the lawn Halloween decoration. A Few days after the gardener mowed the lawn around his body, someone made the horrific discovery and notified the family.
"Don't know how you can do that," said Owens' sister, Haley Shue. "Mow right beside someone and assume that they're Halloween decorations at a house no one lives at."
Fox News reports that Owens' family last saw him on Sunday, October 1. A week after that, police found him in China Grove with barely any clothes on and face down on the lawn of a house that had been vacant "for quite some time."
Owens' sister says that her brother had never been to the house, so the family is confused about how he ended up on the lawn. Police said the man had not been shot or had any visible reasons for his cause of death.
The family learned that he had cuts and scrapes on his arms, leading them to believe he fought for his life. Heley confirmed that her brother was a recovering drug addict, so it's possible he fell off the wagon. But his sister points out that still doesn't explain how her brother ended up nearly nude on a lawn he's never been to.
The police don't suspect foul play in Owens's death. Even so, the police department says they are still investigating his death and hope to have more details about his passing to his loved ones.
