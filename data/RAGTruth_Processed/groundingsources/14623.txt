Amazing memorable experience. Food is delicious & delicate. Ambience is good & staff is really nice.\n- Taisetsu - Garden of the divine - sake, very good quality & clean taste.\n- Hamachi Carpaccio - beautiful dish. Great pieces of fish, and sauce was sooo flavorful I almost wanted to keep it & dip all our food in it.\n- Pacific Rim Roll - good combination of fish & other goodies. Pretty good roll if you like Salmon & Hamachi\n- Banzai Roll - easy delicious clean roll at a good price. We love hamachi :)\n- Seared 5 - came with a piece of Toro, Hamachi, Salmon, Tai, & Hotategai all seared on top. Amazing dish with great flavors. I usually don't order seared or cooked fish at sushi restaurants, this was sooo good. Loved it.\n- Grilled Miyazaki Wagyu A5 - just beautiful. Delicious piece of meat cooked perfectly. It was so good we ordered a 2nd round to finish our meal with."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-16 01:10:58", "review_text": "Solidly consistent delicious food. Our favorite is the mushroom sushi, the portobello. It has this really yummy truffle oil on it. Their salmon sushi is super fresh. Their outdoor seating area is really cute with white lights and lots of heaters. We were there in the rain and totally comfortable! A great menu with some thing for everyone really. Enjoy friends!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-11 19:08:39", "review_text": "This place is amazing! Sushi was great, I would definitely recommend this sushi restaurant.
