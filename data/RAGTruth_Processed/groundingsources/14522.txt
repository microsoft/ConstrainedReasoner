What the heck? Good thing I checked the receipt. Otherwise, I would have tipped again. Opened the bag of clams and it was full of shells. Barely had anything in there. Mussels did not look like it's a pound. The sauce is uber salty."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-11-11 05:34:10", "review_text": "What a great place! I loved the food.
