I may be unaware of a shortage. Though I can't imagine it being this large of a loss. Explanation is welcome. Service is great, food or great. I want to come back."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-02 05:10:12", "review_text": "I was skeptical due to the bone-in wing prices, but the reviews convinced me to splurge. \n\nKale Cirtus salad with Thai peanut bone-in wings (came with 3 wings) was incredible. Kale is fresh, whole leaf Kale. Oranges (cuties) were fresh cut, not canned. Tots did not really belong, but hey, it's a topping! \n\nStrawberry Arbol Boneless boneless wings are incredible. Large, moist, and crispy boneless chicken + sauce on the side. Hot and worth it.\n\nThe Rodeo Fries were are as well. Crispy fries, tender Buffalo boneless chicken, chewy bacon. This should come with at least an option for blue cheese - not sure if this was overlooked on the online menu or just not an option. Will make sure to order a side next time."}]}
