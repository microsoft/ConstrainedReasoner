Everything you need to know about where and when to see the 'Ring of Fire' eclipse on Saturday
Astronomy enthusiasts and skygazers are in for a treat this Saturday morning as a rare celestial event, an annular eclipse, is set to grace the skies.
This awe-inspiring phenomenon will be the last of its kind until 2039, making it a must-see event for space enthusiasts.
Distinguishing itself from a total eclipse, such as the 2017 "Great American Eclipse," during an annular solar eclipse, the moon does not completely obscure the sun as it traverses between the Earth and the sun.
The moon, appearing slightly smaller than the sun, cannot fully cover the sun's disk, creating a captivating effect where the sun peeks around the moon's edges, earning the event the moniker “Ring of Fire.”
According to space.com, the phenomenon of the sun forming a "Ring of Fire" around the moon is a spectacular sight, attracting both amateur and professional astronomers.
The event unfolds as a unique interplay of celestial bodies and offers an incredible spectacle for sky watchers.
While the annular eclipse will grace the skies of multiple states, only the far northeastern corner of California will be in the path of the event's greatest viewing.
In this region, the moon will cover the entire sun, leaving only the sun's outer edges visible.
However, the rest of Northern California will also be in a favorable position to view this celestial wonder.
The eclipse's path will stretch across eight states, starting from Oregon and traversing through to Texas, offering a prime viewing opportunity for many across the United States.
This celestial event has sparked excitement and anticipation among both seasoned astronomers and those just starting to explore the wonders of the universe.
For those eager to witness the 'Ring of Fire,' ensuring safety during the eclipse is paramount.
Experts recommend using proper solar viewing glasses or other safe solar viewing methods to protect one's eyes while enjoying this rare celestial display.
