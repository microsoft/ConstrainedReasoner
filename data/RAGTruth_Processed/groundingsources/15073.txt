The Plaza Deli didn't disappoint and I know first hand why all the great reviews.   The Turkey/Cheese/ Avocado sandwich and Italian sub were loaded with meats and very very good.  They carried a load of great sodas - birch beer you don't find often.  The owner couldn't be any nicer, chatting it up with us and giving our dog Frankie water and biscuits.  Highly recommend supporting this local business ."}, {"review_stars": 3.0, "review_date": "2021-10-30 15:45:45", "review_text": "I've been going to Plaza Deli since I was child in the 90's. The place has always been a good place to go for a quality sandwich at a fair price. But, we have noticed lately the quality of ingredients/preparation isn't up to the same standards and the customer service has been hit or miss. I realize Covid has been hard on us all and businesses but it still feels like something changed with the vibe and quality. After a couple sub-par experiences we may try it again. We hope this is just been a hiccup."}]}
