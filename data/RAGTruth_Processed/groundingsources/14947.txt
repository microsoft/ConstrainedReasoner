Definitely get the feeling that this is a place where they have lots of regulars but it isn't so exclusive that you feel awkward being inside. Bartenders are friendly and it's a lively bustling spot to grab a drink and meet up with a friend."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-18 08:58:13", "review_text": "Honestly today was my first time visiting the bar and I'm highly disappointed with the overall lack of professionalism with this \"bar\" not only did the staff take forever with delivering my drinks for my party they were extremely rude, un-cooperative and had a general feel that I was an inconvenience to them even though I'm trying to have a fun night? I never got her name but there was this one person, a little bit on the younger side who was the most absolute WORST person who I have EVER dealt with when it comes to customer service \nIf I ever visit this bar (which I won't trust me) it will be just to get her name so I can update this review on who this person is, avoid this bar at all cost if you want to feel like just another passerby in a sub-par \"bar\" and go spend your money elsewhere, there's plenty of bars on state street who will treat you better and make feel at home spending your hard earned money\nAgain this bar is the ABSOLUTE WORST ON STATE STREET the staff could care less about your well-being. I would honestly rate 0 stars if I could but it is what it is, and I appreciate you if you read all of this."}, {"review_stars": 1.0, "review_date": "2021-12-18 08:56:25", "review_text": "I felt incredibly bad since my friend wasn't drinking responsibly and ended up throwing up, and in a small bar like this it's definitely an issue that needs to have clear and professional protocol for. Instead of being met by a hostile woman with long blonde hair repeatedly telling me how \"disgusting\" my friend was for doing something she has more than likely done at some point in her life, a stern \"you have to pay the $50 clean up fee and leave\" would have sufficed in my opinion, especially if you work at a bar and have had experiences with this type of issue. The lack of professionalism and empathy was astounding. I understand the frustration but honestly I was trying to make sure that my friend did not require medical attention. The cleaning fee was 100% justified and fair and I understand dealing with human messes is awful but in this case some professionalism and cooperation from personnel would have really helped out. \n\nTLDR: small understaffed bar is busy and clearly not capable of handling common issues which arise when you work at an establishment that primarily sells drinks that can make people throw up but obviously this is a lesson not to over do it and to drink responsibly bc people will shame and call you derogatory things because you happen to inconvenience them and their ability to make money off of alcohol lol"}]}
