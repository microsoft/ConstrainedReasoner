Former Frostburg dentist barred from prescribing controlled substances
This article may contain AI-assisted content.
Baltimore, Maryland - In a recent decision, U.S. District Judge Julie R. Rubin has given approval to a consent decree between the United States and former Frostburg-based dentist, Jordan R. Hobel. This decision comes in light of allegations suggesting Hobel's involvement in illegal opioid prescriptions, in direct violation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).
Key Points
Allegations against Hobel state that between 2017 and 2021, he had issued multiple unauthorized prescriptions of hazardous controlled substances without a valid medical reason.
Hobel misused the DEA registration numbers of his colleagues to prescribe himself drugs, like oxycodone.
In addition, he allegedly prescribed these substances to acquaintances and relatives, some of whom were not his patients.
Despite the severity of the claims, Hobel has rejected the government's allegations.
As part of the consent decree's conditions, Hobel has pledged not to request or aim for the reinstatement of his DEA registration. This registration, essential for prescribing controlled substances, was willingly relinquished by Hobel in 2022.
As our nation battles a surge of opioid overdoses and poisonings, it is more important than ever that healthcare providers prescribe medications in a safe and responsible manner. We know that pharmaceutical abuse has led to a worsening of the opioid crisis as people turn to the streets to find pills which we know most often contain a lethal dose of fentanyl. We encourage prescribers to remain vigilant and responsive to any signs of controlled substance misuse or diversion, for through our collective efforts, we can create a healthier and safer society for all.‚Äù ~ Jarod Forget, Special Agent in Charge, DEA Washington Division
