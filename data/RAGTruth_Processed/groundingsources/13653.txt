There was a group of 6 girls who ordered before us, only one person working the register and making the Boba. I felt really bad for the employee because she looked stressed. I did like how she told us it would take her 10 min before she took our order because she wanted to make the order for the big group before us. Ordering food was faster- seems like they had at least 2 people cooking. I ordered the green tea peach tea with lychee jelly and lychee and strawberry popping boba, but my order came out wrong and I didn't want to wait for her to change the order because it probably would have had to wait another half an hour. I will know my wife's order also got messed up as well. The flavor of the green tea Peach was good oh, but the popping Boba had some that tasted bad. I'm giving this place at to starve because of the long wait, and the popping boba tasting off."}]}
