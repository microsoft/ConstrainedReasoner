{"question": "what is the difference between ligament and tendon", "passages": "passage 1:\u2022 Tendon connects the end of a muscle to any place of the bone, whereas ligaments always connect bones at their joints. \u2022 There is only one tendon for a particular muscle at one end while there are few ligaments connecting two bones at a joint. \u2022 Tendons have more collagens than ligaments do.\n\npassage 2:ligaments connect bone to bone, tendons connect muscle to bone and cartilage is the semi solid bones that are present at the places where they required. For example: our exter \u2026 nal ears, nose, between 2 joints cartilage is present.\n\npassage 3:Yes, The difference between ligaments and tendons are ligaments are BONE TO BONE. And the tendons are BONE TO MUSCLE. Ligaments are the tough tissue that attaches bones at j \u2026 oints and tendons are tough tissue also but attach the bone to muscle (or muscle to bone, vice versa).\n\n"}
