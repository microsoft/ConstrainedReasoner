And when I say great place, I meant the food is great.\n\nYou can eat very good food AND not have to be fussy about it. Go in you PJ's, line up, point at what you want, pay and then walk out and eat your food wherever you are comfortable.\n\nAnd with you to-go item, you can be feasting on a great baguette, a duck confit and a well-dressed salad.\n\nThere are drinks available too.\n\nMasks are required. Number of people are limited indoors so there is a line starting from the door.\n\nAt the time of my visit, outdoor dining was still allowed so there were patio furniture set up and some people were availing themselves of it.\n\nWhich was great because next door is Caffe Luxxe!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2019-08-29 21:44:41", "review_text": "My buddy kept telling me, \"MTG has the best purple worms I've ever had.\" Now I love worms, eat em all the time, but purple? And not underground by the La Colina baseball field? We I gotta see this. So I go for a taste, and low and behold, WEVE GOT WORMS PEOPLE! The waitress kept saying they were octo-somethin and they come from the SEA, but I know a damn worm when I see one. 10/10 love this place!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2016-12-01 19:54:43", "review_text": "Best chocolate chip cookies you'll ever eat.
