VERY obscure/unusual/different/authentic menu. Not American-Chinese food by any stretch. \nI'm in town visiting and needed delivery. I had no idea what to order. I asked Alex (the owner I believe) to bring me the 2 best dishes on the menu. The ones he's proud of. I'll eat anything and love spicy/hot food. \nI don't know what I got but it was bullfrog (no joke) in a spicy sauce with tons of fresh veggies. Bullfrog???  I've never eaten that before. It's bony as hell but delicious. \nHe sent me a second chicken dish that also had some spice with peanuts. It was just as good. \nNext time I'm back in SB I'm just calling and asking him to bring me something great. It seeems to work. This place is a real find. Caution: it's Szechuan so be prepared for the heat. I say \"bring it\"."}, {"review_stars": 4.0, "review_date": "2020-06-08 03:46:54", "review_text": "We were staying at the Bacara and needed some food.  We ordered from here based on yelp.  When looking at the menu, we realized it wasn't a typcial chinese place.  No orange chicken, no chow mein, etc.  WE opted for the dumpliing in hot sauce, the kung pao chicken, long beans, fried rice, mapa tofu, and hot braised beef noodle.  They don't offer hot sauce (said everything was already seasoned perfectly).  I was a tad skeptical, but they were right.  Things were pretty well flavored.  Good heat through out.  The food was pretty darn good.  I just wished they gave more beef in the beef noodle.  The long beans were nice a crunchy.  The fried rice was really flavorful and not overly salty.  \nOver all, we had a great meal here. Just wished they gave us rice with the dishes and offer plates for togo orders."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-03-27 15:25:09", "review_text": "I've lived in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, and I can say that Lucky Dragon has the most authentic and delicious Sichuan food in Santa Barbara county. Great service too. Really, love them so much."}]}
