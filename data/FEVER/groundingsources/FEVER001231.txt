Usain St Leo Bolt , OJ , CD -LRB- -LSB- ˈjuːseɪn -RSB- born 21 August 1986 -RRB- is a Jamaican sprinter . He is the first person to hold both the 100 metres and 200 metres world records since fully automatic time became mandatory . He also holds the world record as a part of the 4 × 100 metres relay . He is the reigning world and Olympic champion in these three events . Due to his unprecedented dominance and achievements in sprint competition , he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time .   An eight-time Olympic gold medalist , Bolt won the 100 m , 200 m and 4 × 100 m relay at three consecutive Olympic Games , although he subsequently lost one of the gold medals -LRB- as well as the world record set therein -RRB- nine years after the fact due to teammate Nesta Carter 's disqualification for doping offences . He gained worldwide popularity for his double sprint victory at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in world record times . Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m titles at three consecutive olympics -LRB- 2008 , 2012 and 2016 -RRB- , a feat referred to as the `` triple double . ''   An eleven-time World Champion , he won consecutive World Championship 100 m , 200 m and 4 × 100 metres relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015 , with the exception of a 100 m false start in 2011 . He is the most successful athlete of the World Championships and was the first athlete to win three titles in both the 100 m and 200 m at the competition .   Bolt improved upon his first 100 m world record of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 -- the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing . He has twice broken the 200 metres world record , setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009 . He has helped Jamaica to three 4 × 100 metres relay world records , with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012 . Bolt 's most successful event is the 200 m , with three Olympic and four World titles . The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100 m ; he had earlier won numerous 200 m medals -LRB- including 2007 World Championship silver -RRB- and holds the world under-20 and world under-18 records for the event .   His achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname `` Lightning Bolt '' , and his awards include the IAAF World Athlete of the Year , Track & Field Athlete of the Year , and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year -LRB- four times -RRB- . Bolt has stated that he intends to retire from athletics after the 2017 World Championships . 
The 100 metres , or 100-metre dash , is a sprint race in track and field competitions . The shortest common outdoor running distance , it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics . It has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women .    The reigning 100 m Olympic champion is often named `` the fastest runner in the world . '' The World Championships 100 metres has been contested since 1983 . Jamaicans Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce are the reigning world champions , Bolt and Elaine Thompson are the Olympic champions in the men 's and women 's 100 metres , respectively .   On an outdoor 400 metres running track , the 100 m is run on the home straight , with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race . Runners begin in the starting blocks and the race begins when an official fires the starter 's pistol . Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 -- 60 m . Their speed then slows towards the finish line .   The 10-second barrier has historically been a barometer of fast men 's performances , while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race . The current men 's world record is 9.58 seconds , set by Jamaica 's Usain Bolt in 2009 , while the women 's world record of 10.49 seconds set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 remains unbroken .   The 100 m -LRB- 109.361 yards -RRB- emerged from the metrication of the 100 yards -LRB- 91.44 m -RRB- , a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries . The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100 m straight .   US athletes have won the men 's Olympic 100 metres title more times than any other country , 16 out of the 28 times that it has been run . US women have also dominated the event winning 9 out of 21 times . 
The 200 metres -LRB- also spelled 200 meters -RRB- is a sprint running event . On an outdoor 400 m track , the race begins on the curve and ends on the home straight , so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race . A slightly shorter race , called the stadion and run on a straight track , was the first recorded event at the ancient Olympic Games . The 200 m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes rely on different energy systems during the longer sprint .   In the United States and elsewhere , athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash -LRB- 201.168 m -RRB- instead of the 200 m -LRB- 218.723 yards -RRB- , though the distance is now obsolete . The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200 m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds , but other conversion methods exist . Another obsolete version of this race is the 200 metres straight , which was run on tracks that contained such a straight . Initially , when the International Amateur Athletic Association -LRB- now known as the International Association of Athletics Federations -RRB- started to ratify world records in 1912 , only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration . In 1951 , the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track . In 1976 , the straight record was discarded .   The race attracts runners from other events , primarily the 100 metres , wishing to double up and claim both titles . This feat has been achieved by men eleven times at the Olympic Games : by Archie Hahn in 1904 , Ralph Craig in 1912 , Percy Williams in 1928 , Eddie Tolan in 1932 , Jesse Owens in 1936 , Bobby Morrow in 1956 , Valeriy Borzov in 1972 , Carl Lewis in 1984 , and most recently by Jamaica 's Usain Bolt in 2008 , 2012 , and 2016 . The double has been accomplished by women seven times : by Fanny Blankers-Koen in 1948 , Marjorie Jackson in 1952 , Betty Cuthbert in 1956 , Wilma Rudolph in 1960 , Renate Stecher in 1972 and Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 . Marion Jones finished first in both races in 2000 but was later disqualified and stripped of her medals after admitting to taking performance-enhancing drugs . An Olympic double of 200 m and 400 m was first achieved by Valerie Brisco-Hooks in 1984 , and later by Michael Johnson from the United States and Marie-José Pérec of France both in 1996 . Usain Bolt is the only man to repeat as Olympic champion , Bärbel Wöckel -LRB- née Eckert -RRB- and Veronica Campbell-Brown are the two women who have repeated as Olympic champion .   The men 's world record holder is Usain Bolt of Jamaica , who ran 19.19 s at the 2009 World Championships . The women 's world record holder is Florence Griffith-Joyner of the United States , who ran 21.34 s at the 1988 Summer Olympics . The reigning Olympic champions are Usain Bolt and Elaine Thompson -LRB- Jamaica -RRB- . The reigning World Champions are Bolt and Dafne Schippers -LRB- the Netherlands -RRB- .   Races run with an aiding wind measured over 2.0 metres per second are not acceptable for record purposes .
