John Clayton Mayer -LRB- -LSB- ˈmeɪ.ɚ -RSB- born October 16 , 1977 -RRB- is an American singer-songwriter , guitarist , and producer . He was born in Bridgeport , Connecticut , and raised in nearby Fairfield . He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston , but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook . Together , they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters . After their split , Mayer continued to play local clubs -- refining his skills and gaining a following . After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival , he was signed to Aware Records , and then Columbia Records , which released his first EP , Inside Wants Out . His following two full-length albums -- Room for Squares -LRB- 2001 -RRB- and Heavier Things -LRB- 2003 -RRB- -- did well commercially , achieving multi-platinum status . In 2003 , he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single `` Your Body Is a Wonderland '' .   Though Mayer started his career mainly performing acoustic rock , he began moving towards the blues genre that had originally influenced him as a musician . By 2005 , he was collaborating with blues artists such as B. B. King , Buddy Guy , and Eric Clapton . Forming the John Mayer Trio , he released a live album in 2005 called Try ! , and his third studio album Continuum in 2006 . Both albums received wide critical acclaim , and Continuum earned Mayer a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album . He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for `` Waiting on the World to Change '' . That album was followed by Battle Studies in 2009 , a return to pop , with a number-one grossing tour .   After having several controversial incidents with the media , Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on a follow-up album , called Born and Raised , that would draw inspiration from the 1970s pop music of Laurel Canyon . However , the discovery of a granuloma on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012 , and ultimately forced him to cancel the planned tour . Even so , the album enjoyed a generally favorable reception , though was less commercially successful than his previous work . After extensive treatments for his vocal problems -- and a two-year hiatus -- Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013 , and that year released the album , Paradise Valley . The album is named for where he lives in Montana and features country music influences . By 2014 , he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide . After developing an interest in the Grateful Dead and connecting with Bob Weir , Mayer formed Dead & Company with three former Grateful Dead musicians . After two well-received tours in the fall of 2015 and summer of 2016 , the band has already committed to another tour for the summer of 2017 .   Mayer 's secondary career pursuits extend to television hosting , comedy , and writing ; he has authored columns for magazines such as Esquire . He supports various causes and has performed at charity benefits . He is a watch aficionado -LRB- with a collection he values in the `` tens of millions '' of dollars -RRB- , and has been on the jury at the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève . He currently lives in Montana . His latest song is `` Love on the Weekend '' .

Connecticut -LRB- -LSB- kəˈnɛtᵻkət -RSB- -RRB- is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States . As of the 2010 Census , Connecticut features the highest per-capita income , Human Development Index -LRB- 0.962 -RRB- , and median household income in the United States . Connecticut is bordered by Rhode Island to the east , Massachusetts to the north , New York to the west , and Long Island Sound to the south . Its capital city is Hartford , and its most populous city is Bridgeport . Although Connecticut is technically part of New England , it is often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-state area . The state is named for the Connecticut River , a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state . The word `` Connecticut '' is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for `` long tidal river '' .   Connecticut is the third smallest state by area , the 29th most populous , and the fourth most densely populated of the 50 United States . It is known as the `` Constitution State '' , the `` Nutmeg State '' , the `` Provisions State '' , and the `` Land of Steady Habits '' . It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States . Much of southern and western Connecticut -LRB- along with the majority of the state 's population -RRB- is part of the New York metropolitan area ; three of Connecticut 's eight counties are statistically included in the New York City combined statistical area , which is widely referred to as the Tri-State area . Connecticut 's center of population is in Cheshire , New Haven County , which is also located within the Tri-State area .   Connecticut 's first European settlers were Dutch . They established a small , short-lived settlement in present-day Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut rivers called Huys de Goede Hoop . Initially , half of Connecticut was a part of the Dutch colony New Netherland , which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware rivers . The first major settlements were established in the 1630s by England . Thomas Hooker led a band of followers overland from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded what became the Connecticut Colony ; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony . The Connecticut and New Haven Colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders , considered the first constitutions in North America . In 1662 , the three colonies were merged under a royal charter , making Connecticut a crown colony . This colony was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution .   The Connecticut River , Thames River , and ports along the Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong Maritime tradition which continues today . The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry , including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in Fairfield County .
