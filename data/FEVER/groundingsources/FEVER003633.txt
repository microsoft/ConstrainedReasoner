An extended play -LRB- EP -RRB- is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single , but is usually unqualified as an album or LP . EPs generally do not contain as many tracks as albums , and are considered `` less expensive and time-consuming '' for an artist to produce than an album . An EP originally referred to specific types of vinyl records other than 78 rpm standard play -LRB- SP -RRB- and LP , but it is now applied to mid-length CDs and downloads as well .   Ricardo Baca of The Denver Post said , `` EPs -- originally extended-play ` single ' releases that are shorter than traditional albums -- have long been popular with punk and indie bands . '' In the United Kingdom , the Official Chart Company defines a boundary between EP and album classification at 25 minutes of length or four tracks -LRB- not counting alternative versions of featured songs , if present -RRB- .
