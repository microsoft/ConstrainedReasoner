The Old Vic is a theatre in Lambeth , London , England , located just south-east of Waterloo station on the corner of The Cut and Waterloo Road . Established in 1818 as the Royal Coburg Theatre , and renamed in 1833 the Royal Victoria Theatre , in 1871 it was rebuilt and reopened as the Royal Victoria Palace . It was taken over by Emma Cons in 1880 and formally named the Royal Victoria Hall , although by this time it was already known as the `` Old Vic '' . In 1898 , a niece of Cons , Lilian Baylis assumed management and began a series of Shakespeare productions in 1914 . The building was damaged in 1940 during air raids and it became a Grade II * listed building in 1951 after it reopened .   It was also the name of a repertory company that was based at the theatre and formed the core of the National Theatre of Great Britain on its formation in 1963 , under Laurence Olivier . The National Theatre remained at the Old Vic until new premises were constructed on the South Bank , opening in 1976 . The Old Vic then became the home of Prospect Theatre Company , at that time a highly successful touring company which staged such acclaimed productions as Derek Jacobi 's Hamlet . However , with the withdrawal of funding for the company by the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1980 for breaching its touring obligations , Prospect disbanded in 1981 . The theatre underwent complete refurbishment in 1985 . In 2003 , Kevin Spacey was appointed as new artistic director of the Old Vic Theatre Company which received considerable media attention . In 2015 , Matthew Warchus succeeded Spacey as artistic director .
