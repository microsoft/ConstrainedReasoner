Marshall and Stern v. Marshall . 
An infant -LRB- from the Latin word infans , meaning `` unable to speak '' or `` speechless '' -RRB- is the more formal or specialised synonym for `` baby '' , the very young offspring of a human or other animal .   A newborn is , in colloquial use , an infant who is only hours , days , or up to one month old . In medical contexts , newborn or neonate -LRB- from Latin , neonatus , newborn -RRB- refers to an infant in the first 28 days after birth ; the term applies to premature , full term , and postmature infants ; before birth , the term `` fetus '' is used . The term `` infant '' is typically applied to young children between one month and one year of age ; however , definitions may vary and may include children up to two years of age . When a human child learns to walk , the term `` toddler '' may be used instead .   In British English , `` infant '' is a term that can be applied to school children aged between four and seven . As a legal term , `` infancy '' continues from birth until age 18 .
