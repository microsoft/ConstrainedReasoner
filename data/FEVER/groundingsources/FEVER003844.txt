Blink-182 -LRB- often stylized as blink-182 ; pronounced `` blink one eighty two '' -RRB- is an American rock band formed in Poway , California in 1992 . The band currently consists of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus , drummer Travis Barker , and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba . Founded by guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge , bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor , the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor . Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action ; in response , the band appended the meaningless number '' -182 '' .   In its early years , Blink-182 toured heavily behind the band 's debut , Cheshire Cat -LRB- 1995 -RRB- . The group signed with major label MCA Records to co-distribute its second album , Dude Ranch -LRB- 1997 -RRB- . Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker . The group 's next two releases , Enema of the State -LRB- 1999 -RRB- and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , were enormous successes on the strength of radio and MTV airplay . The eponymously titled Blink-182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group . DeLonge quit in 2005 , sending the band into what was termed an `` indefinite hiatus '' . They reunited in 2009 , producing the trio 's sixth album , Neighborhoods -LRB- 2011 -RRB- . In 2015 , DeLonge again exited and was replaced by Alkaline Trio guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba . The band 's seventh studio album , California , was released on July 1 , 2016 .   Blink-182 is considered a key group in the development of pop punk ; the band 's combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands . The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States , and over 50 million albums worldwide . In 2011 , The New York Times asserted , `` no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182 , '' and even as the band receded after its 2005 split , `` its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands , like All Time Low and The Maine .
