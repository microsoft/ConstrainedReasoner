The Boeing 737 is an American short - to medium-range twinjet narrow-body airliner . Originally developed as a shorter , lower-cost twin-engine airliner derived from Boeing 's 707 and 727 , the 737 has developed into a family of ten passenger models with capacities from 85 to 215 passengers . The 737 is Boeing 's only narrow-body airliner in production , with the 737 Next Generation -LRB- -700 , -800 , and -900 ER -RRB- variants currently being built . Production has also begun on the re-engined and redesigned 737 MAX , which is set to enter service in 2017 .   Originally envisioned in 1964 , the initial 737-100 made its first flight in April 1967 and entered airline service in February 1968 at Lufthansa . Next , the lengthened 737-200 entered service in April 1968 . In the 1980s Boeing launched the -300 , -400 , and -500 models , subsequently referred to as the Boeing 737 Classic series . The 737 Classics added capacity and incorporated CFM56 turbofan engines along with wing improvements .   In the 1990s , Boeing introduced the 737 Next Generation , with multiple changes including a redesigned , increased span laminar flow wing , upgraded `` glass '' cockpit , and new interior . The 737 Next Generation comprises the four -600 , -700 , -800 , and -900 models , ranging from 102 ft to 138 ft in length . Boeing Business Jet versions of the 737 Next Generation are also produced .   The 737 series is the best-selling jet commercial airliner in history . The 737 has been continuously manufactured by Boeing since 1967 with 9,486 aircraft delivered and 4,478 orders yet to be fulfilled . Assembly of the 737 is performed at the Boeing Renton Factory in Renton , Washington . Many 737s serve markets previously filled by 707 , 727 , 757 , DC-9 , and MD-80 / MD-90 airliners , and the aircraft currently competes primarily with the Airbus A320 family . As of 2006 , there were an average of 1,250 Boeing 737s airborne at any given time , with two departing or landing somewhere every five seconds . 
The Boeing 727 is a midsized , narrow-body three-engined jet aircraft built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes from the early 1960s to 1984 . It can carry 149 to 189 passengers and later models can fly up to 2700 nmi nonstop . Intended for short and medium-length flights , the 727 can use relatively short runways at smaller airports . It has three Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines below the T-tail , one on each side of the rear fuselage with a center engine that connects through an S-duct to an inlet at the base of the fin . The 727 is Boeing 's only trijet aircraft .   The 727 followed the 707 , a quad-jet airliner , with which it shares its upper fuselage cross-section and cockpit design . The 727-100 first flew in February 1963 and entered service with Eastern Air Lines in February 1964 ; the stretched 727-200 flew in July 1967 and entered service with Northeast Airlines that December . The 727 became a mainstay of airlines ' domestic route networks and was also used on short - and medium-range international routes . Passenger , freighter , and convertible versions of the 727 were built .   The 727 was heavily produced into the 1970s ; the last 727 was completed in 1984 . , a total of 64 Boeing 727s -LRB- 4 × 727-100s and 60 × -200 s -RRB- were in commercial service with 26 airlines , plus a few more in government and private use . Airport noise regulations have led to 727s being equipped with hush kits .
