Respiratory disease is a medical term that encompasses pathological conditions affecting the organs and tissues that make gas exchange possible in higher organisms , and includes conditions of the upper respiratory tract , trachea , bronchi , bronchioles , alveoli , pleura and pleural cavity , and the nerves and muscles of breathing . Respiratory diseases range from mild and self-limiting , such as the common cold , to life-threatening entities like bacterial pneumonia , pulmonary embolism , acute asthma and lung cancer .   The study of respiratory disease is known as pulmonology . A doctor who specializes in respiratory disease is known as a pulmonologist , a chest medicine specialist , a respiratory medicine specialist , a respirologist or a thoracic medicine specialist .   Respiratory diseases can be classified in many different ways , including by the organ or tissue involved , by the type and pattern of associated signs and symptoms , or by the cause of the disease . 
Common cold , also known simply as a cold , is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose . The throat , sinuses , and voice box may also be affected . Signs and symptoms may begin less than two days following exposure . They include coughing , sore throat , runny nose , sneezing , headache , and fever . People usually recover in seven to ten days . Some symptoms may last up to three weeks . In those with other health problems , pneumonia may occasionally develop .   Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in the cause of the common cold ; the rhinoviruses are the most common . They spread through the air during close contact with infected people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose . Risk factors include going to daycare , not sleeping well , and psychological stress . Symptoms are mostly due to the body 's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves . People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold , though symptoms are usually more severe in the former . Influenza is less likely to result in a runny nose .   There is no vaccine for the common cold . The primary methods of prevention are hand washing ; not touching the eyes , nose or mouth with unwashed hands ; and staying away from other sick people . Some evidence supports the use of face masks . No cure for the common cold exists , but the symptoms can be treated . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -LRB- NSAIDs -RRB- such as ibuprofen may help with pain . Antibiotics should not be used . Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines .   The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans . The average adult gets two to four colds a year , while the average child may get six to eight . They occur more commonly during the winter . These infections have been with humanity since ancient times .
