Instant messaging -LRB- IM -RRB- is a type of online chat that offers real-time text transmission over the Internet . A LAN messenger operates in a similar way over a local area network . Short messages are typically transmitted bi-directionally between two parties , when each user chooses to complete a thought and select `` send '' . Some IM applications can use push technology to provide real-time text , which transmits messages character by character , as they are composed . More advanced instant messaging can add file transfer , clickable hyperlinks , Voice over IP , or video chat .   Non-IM types of chat include multicast transmission , usually referred to as `` chat rooms '' , where participants might be anonymous or might be previously known to each other -LRB- for example collaborators on a project that is using chat to facilitate communication -RRB- . Instant messaging systems tend to facilitate connections between specified known users -LRB- often using a contact list also known as a `` buddy list '' or `` friend list '' -RRB- . Depending on the IM protocol , the technical architecture can be peer-to-peer -LRB- direct point-to-point transmission -RRB- or client-server -LRB- an Instant message service center retransmits messages from the sender to the communication device -RRB- .
