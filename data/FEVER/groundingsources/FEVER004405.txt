The 2003 UEFA Cup Final was played on 21 May 2003 between Celtic of Scotland and Porto of Portugal . Porto won the match 3 -- 2 in extra time thanks to a goal from Derlei . This was also the first game to use the silver goal rule , although it did not affect the outcome of the game as Porto scored in the second half of extra-time , thus meaning the game had to be played until the end of extra-time .   Prior to this game , no club from Scotland or Portugal had ever won the UEFA Cup .   The game had what UEFA described at the time as `` the largest travelling support to have assembled for a single game '' -- around 80,000 Celtic fans travelled to Seville for the final . For this turnout and the manner with which they conducted themselves , Celtic fans received an award from FIFA and UEFA , winning the FIFA Fair Play Award that year and being presented with a formal recognition from UEFA at a home match the following season .
