Howard Robard Hughes Jr. -LRB- December 24 , 1905 -- April 5 , 1976 -RRB- was an American businessman , investor , pilot , film director , and philanthropist , known during his lifetime as one of the most financially successful individuals in the world . He first made a name for himself as a film producer , and then became an influential figure in the aviation industry . Later in life , he became known for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle -- oddities that were caused in part by a worsening obsessive -- compulsive disorder -LRB- OCD -RRB- and chronic pain from a plane crash .   As a maverick film tycoon , Hughes gained prominence in Hollywood beginning in the late 1920s , when he produced big-budget and often controversial films like The Racket -LRB- 1928 -RRB- , Hell 's Angels -LRB- 1930 -RRB- , and Scarface -LRB- 1932 -RRB- . Later he controlled the RKO film studio .   Hughes formed the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1932 , hiring numerous engineers and designers . He spent the rest of the 1930s setting multiple world air speed records and building the Hughes H-1 Racer and H-4 Hercules -LRB- the `` Spruce Goose '' -RRB- . He acquired and expanded Trans World Airlines and later acquired Air West , renaming it Hughes Airwest . Hughes was included in Flying Magazine 's list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation , ranked at 25 .

Trans World Airlines -LRB- TWA -RRB- was a major American airline from 1924 until 2001 . It was formed as Transcontinental & Western Air to operate a route from New York City to Los Angeles via St. Louis , Kansas City , and other stops , with Ford Trimotors . With American , United , and Eastern , it was one of the `` Big Four '' domestic airlines in the United States formed by the Spoils Conference of 1930 .   Howard Hughes acquired control of TWA in 1939 , and after World War II led the expansion of the airline to serve Europe , the Middle East , and Asia , making TWA a second unofficial flag carrier of the United States after Pan Am . Hughes gave up control in the 1960s , and the new management of TWA acquired Hilton International and Century 21 in an attempt to diversify the company 's business .   As the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 led to a wave of airline failures , start-ups , and takeovers in the United States , TWA was spun off from its holding company in 1984 . Carl Icahn acquired control of TWA and took the company private in a leveraged buyout in 1988 . TWA became saddled with debt , sold its London routes , underwent Chapter 11 restructuring in 1992 and 1995 , and was further stressed by the explosion of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 .   In 2001 , TWA filed for a third and final bankruptcy and was acquired by American Airlines . American laid off many former TWA employees in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 attacks and closed its St. Louis hub in 2003 .   TWA was headquartered at one time in Kansas City , Missouri , and planned to make Kansas City International Airport its main domestic and international hub , but abandoned this plan in the 1970s . The airline later developed its largest hub at Lambert-St . Louis International Airport . Its main trans-Atlantic hub was the TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City , an architectural icon designed by Eero Saarinen and completed in 1962 .
