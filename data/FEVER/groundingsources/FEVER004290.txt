Paranormal events are phenomena described in popular culture , folklore , and other non-scientific bodies of knowledge , whose existence within these contexts is described to lie beyond normal experience or scientific explanation .   A paranormal phenomenon is different from hypothetical concepts such as dark matter and dark energy . Unlike paranormal phenomena , these hypothetical concepts are based on empirical observations and experimental data gained through the scientific method .   The most notable paranormal beliefs include those that pertain to ghosts , extraterrestrial life , unidentified flying objects , psychic abilities or extrasensory perception , and cryptids . 
Extrasensory perception , ESP or Esper , also called sixth sense , includes reception of information not gained through the recognized physical senses but sensed with the mind . The term was adopted by Duke University psychologist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as intuition , telepathy , psychometry , clairaudience , and clairvoyance , and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition .   Parapsychology is the study of paranormal psychic phenomena , including ESP . Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research . The scientific community rejects ESP due to the absence of an evidence base , the lack of a theory which would explain ESP , and the lack of experimental techniques which can provide reliably positive results ; and considers ESP to be pseudoscience .
