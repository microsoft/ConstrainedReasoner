A camera captured the moment a penguin fled to safety on a sightseeing boat as killer whales hunted it. In the video, the penguin was seen fleeing in the water then tried to jump into a boat, only to be unsuccessful at first. Onlookers said the killer whales stayed with the boats for a while but eventually gave up as the penguin rested in safety.
