A court in the United States has rejected Britney Spears’s attempt to remove her father as conservator of her estate.
A Los Angeles superior court judge declined to suspend James Spears, 68, from his role as legal conservator, which he has held for the past 12 years, after concerns about the singer’s mental health.
Ms Spears’s lawyer said the 38-year-old star would not perform as long as he remained in the role and that she was “afraid” of her father.
Samuel Ingham told the judge: “My client has informed me that she is afraid of her father. She will not perform again if her father is in charge of her career.”
Mr Spears’s lawyer argued that he had always acted in the best interests
