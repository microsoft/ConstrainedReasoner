Microsoft has unveiled further details about the camera of the company's upcoming Surface Duo handset, including the available shooting modes, features and the app's user interface.
One of a phone’s most used features is its camera, and yet relatively little was known about the Surface Duo’s camera. However, in a live chat session between a Microsoft Store associate and a customer,, Microsoft has revealed a little more about what we can expect from the unique handset’s camera.
A series of screenshots detail the camera app that the phone will ship with, and there’s nothing unusual here. The app follows the traditional camera app layout that we have come to expect: the view from the lens covers the whole screen, with a large circular shutter button overlaid on top of the image. More interestingly, we can also see the different shooting modes, though these aren’t groundbreaking either with users being able to take one of a: photo, video, slow-mo, portrait or panorama. At the top of the UI are options for switching the flash on/off and setting a timer for a photo to be taken.
Unfortunately, the screenshots do little to reveal exactly how good the Duo’s 11MP performs; it seems as though we will have to wait until nearer the handset’s 10 September release date to find that out. It seems unlikely that the camera will be a major selling point of the device though, with it’s unique, hinged, dual-screen design seeing to that.
