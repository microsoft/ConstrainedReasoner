Sabrina Parr set the record straight, dismissing her ex-fiance Lamar Odom’s shocking claims made on “The Wendy Williams Show.”
Sabrina Parr set the record straight, dismissing her ex-fiance Lamar Odom’s shocking claims that he made while he was a guest on “The Wendy Williams Show.”
According to Hip Hollywood, Odom coyly claimed Parr slept with his ex Khloe Kardashian’s significant other, NBA player Tristan Thompson. When Wendy pressed Lamar for clarification, he wouldn’t say anything further- leaving the idea to ruminate.
Odom also called his ex-fiancée, Parr, a “hurt woman” and said she needed therapy. The on-again, off-again couple called off their engagement back in December with a series of social media posts made to air out each other’s alleged dirty laundry.
HipHollywood sat down with Parr, who is a self-described fitness guru, to chat with her about her upcoming episode of OWN’s “Behind Every Man” and Parr revealed she hadn’t watched Odom’s interview with Williams but had heard about his comments and decided not to feed into it by responding- decided instead to simply dismiss.
“I’m just gonna allow Lamar, his narrative to be his narrative, like I literally have no intention to respond to it,” Parr stated.
“I think at the end of the day, if people continue to watch me and watch him, they’ll be able to see what’s true and what’s not, and what matters and what doesn’t matter, and for me, it’s kind of counterproductive to clear up anything,” she said.
