PUBG Corporation officially registered its company with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) in India under the name PUBG India Private Limited, according to a report from AFK Gaming. The company is listed as a “subsidiary of a foregin company” as per the MCA website and is based out of Bangalore in Karnataka.
In the signatory details, two names are mentioned – Hyunil Sohn, who is the head of corporate development at PUBG Corp., and Kumar Krishnan Iyer. Although PUBG Corp. revealed plans to re-launch PUBG Mobile in India earlier this month, there has been little forward-facing progress on the front since. A teaser involving popular personalities and players was also released on PUBG Mobile India’s YouTube channel, but there has been little in terms of an official launch date.
While the announcement and trailer indicated that the game was to be released before or on the festival of Diwali, conflicting reports suggested that PUBG Corp was facing challenges in getting government approvals to launch the game. Despite committing $100M USD to growing the game in India as well as tweaking it to meet the nation’s standards, there have been hiccups in getting a green signal from the government.
PUBG Mobile was banned in India in early September as the Indian government cracked down on Chinese companies and investments in the country. India was the country with the largest player base with various sources suggesting over 30 Million active players before the game was banned.
