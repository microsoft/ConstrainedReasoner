Joey King is opening up about what it was like working with former boyfriend Jacob Elordi on The Kissing Booth 2.
The pair, who met and started dating while filming the first Kissing Booth, later split, although their reported breakup was never made official. Since going their separate romantic ways, Joey has spoken about what it's like to work with Jacob, and in a new interview with Cosmopolitan, the Netflix star got honest, addressing the pair's recent filming reunion.
Appearing on the September cover of Cosmopolitan, Joey admitted that an added pressure came in working with Jacob. “I’m sure people will analyze every movement and every detail. And you know what? Let them. But at the end of the day, I was just thrilled to be Elle Evans again...There’s so much I want to say," she said.
She continued, looking for the most “correct way” to express her feelings. “Elle Evans needs her Noah Flynn, and whatever that means for my personal life, I’ll do anything to make sure the story of my character who I care about so much is complete,” she said.
Her comments are similar to ones she previously made on the podcast Mood with Lauren Elizabeth, when she said that working with Jacob was a “sacrifice” worth making. “It was crazy. It was a wild experience, but honestly, it was a really beautiful time because I learned a lot about myself and I grew as an actor, I grew as a person,” she said back in November. "I'm not outwardly addressing, but what I'm kinda on the sly addressing, making those sacrifices was totally worth it."
Netflix has shared that a third Kissing Booth film was already filmed in secret and is due out in 2021. While there's nothing official on a possible storyline, both Jacob and Joey appeared in the social media teaser confirming the film's newest chapter.
