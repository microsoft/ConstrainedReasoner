It’s Sunday and time to take a look at what are the most popular movies and shows on Disney+.
This week saw a huge shuffle around within the charts, Pixar’s Onward made a huge smash as it flew straight into the number one slot, knocking Frozen off the top of the chart. The addition of other new and legacy content for the start of the month has caused a drastic change, with 8 titles leaving the list.
Both the new Disney+ Original DisneyNature movies, Elephant and Dolphin Reed just cracked the top 10. Unfortunately last years, DisneyNature movie, Penguins, didn’t make the top 25.
Here is what’s trending on Disney+ for the week ending April 5th 2020:
Onward (-) Frozen 2 (1) The Simpsons (2) Star Wars: The Clone Wars (3) Toy Story 4 (6) Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (4) Moana (5) Frozen (7) Dolphin Reef (-) Elephant (-) Jessie (12) Avengers: Endgame (10) The Last Song (-) Star Wars: The Mandalorian (9) Tangled (14) Aladdin (2019) )8) Coco (-) Dr Doolittle (-) The Lion King (2019) (11) Zootopia (13) Inside Out (21) Hannah Montana (-) Phineas & Ferb (16) Wizards Of Waverley Place (-) Captain Marvel (20)
Disney don’t provide actual viewing numbers for Disney+, so this chart is based off the Trending section on my Disney+ app on Sunday morning.
