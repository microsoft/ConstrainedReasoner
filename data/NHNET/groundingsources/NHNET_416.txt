Lili Reinhart hopes that people on the internet will leave Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt alone after the former married couple reunited for a live streamed event this week.
Brad and Jen were two of the stars who participated in the Fast Times at Ridgemont High table read and all eyes were on them of course.
“Unpopular opinion: can we just leave Jennifer and Brad alone? Stop analyzing their every move and facial expression whenever they’re involved in something together. Let them live their lives in peace,” Lili tweeted on Friday (September 18).
During the table read, Brad and Jen read a very steamy pool scene in which his character had an erotic daydream that involved her character.
Lili knows what it’s like to have her relationship be in the spotlight.
