If her pre-show ritual is anything to go by, Gaga’s performance at the VMAs on Sunday will be her most extreme yet.
Whether it’s her iconic meat dress or her four-in-one look at last year’s Met Gala, Lady Gaga has never been afraid of going to fashion’s most dramatic extremes with her style. Now, it seems she’s extending this philosophy to her beauty routine too. Posting to Instagram ahead of her performance at this year’s socially-distanced MTV Video Music Awards taking place on Sunday night at various locations across New York City, Gaga offered fans a glimpse into her preparations for the big night—here involving 2020’s most hardcore wellness trend, the ice bath.
While the treatment has long been a mainstay of athletes to aid muscle recovery after intense workouts, it has been gaining traction over the past year in broader wellness circles thanks to its anti-inflammatory and energy-boosting benefits. (It even earned a seal of approval from the grande dame of unconventional beauty treatments herself, Gwyneth Paltrow, who spotlighted polar plunges in an episode of her Netflix show The Goop Lab.) For Gaga’s post, however, she went down a typically rockstar route. Sporting a face mask, she held up her hands in the Gene Simmons devil horns gesture, while hashtagging the VMAs in her caption. So mark your calendars: if her pre-show rituals are anything to go by, on Sunday we’re in for Gaga’s biggest, boldest performance yet.
