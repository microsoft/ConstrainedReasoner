IT was a simple gesture: To walk a hundred laps outside his home. It was a simple phrase: “Tomorrow, will be a better day”.
But Captain Sir Tom Moore, who has passed away, aged 100, touched so many lives over the past year.
The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, paid tribute and asked if people would give Captain Tom a round of applause at 6pm on Wednesday night.
The Port of Tilbury duly obliged.
The vessels were the Spirit of Adventure and the Spirit of Discovery.
