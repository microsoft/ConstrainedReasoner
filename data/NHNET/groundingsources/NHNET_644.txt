On Wednesday, Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States. Between heightened security at the U. S. Capitol and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, his inauguration is going to look much different compared to previous transitions of power. It will still be a star-studded celebration though, featuring popular performers throughout the day starting with Lady Gaga who is set to sing the national anthem at the swearing-in ceremony.
