A Utah man is facing a first-degree murder charge for allegedly stabbing his Tinder date to death, police said Sunday.
Ethan Hunsaker, 24, called 911 shortly after 3 a.m. Sunday and told cops he had killed his 25-year-old date, just hours after the two met through the popular dating app, the Layton Police Department in Utah said in a press release posted on Facebook.
Police said officers responding to the North Reid Avenue home found the woman, whose name was not released, with “multiple stab wounds to the torso.”
Hunsaker allegedly choked the woman for about a minute but grabbed a kitchen knife after she fought back, according to court records reviewed by ABC News affiliate KTVX in Utah.
“There are marks on Ethan’s arms, neck and shoulder area supporting the fight,” the court papers said.
According to the Deseret News, police said in an affidavit that “Hunsaker stated to dispatch he ‘did not know’ the person he had just killed, but had met the victim on an application called Tinder.”
When officers arrived at the home, Hunsaker “continued to tell officers to shoot him,” the outlet reported.
First responders attempted to revive the woman but she was pronounced dead at the scene, Layton police said.
“The motive behind this homicide is under further investigation,” the department said. “However, the attack appears to have been unprovoked.”
Hunsaker was booked on the murder charge and is at the Davis County Jail awaiting a court appearance, police said.
