Apple is rumored to be bringing back the 12-inch MacBook, but refreshed with Apple Silicon, 20-hour battery, & better graphics performance.
Rumors and leaks suggest Apple will bring back the 12-inch MacBook, but refreshed with Apple Silicon and featuring an even longer battery life. This is expected to be the first consumer Mac based on Apple's own processors, the same CPUs used in its iPad tablets. Choosing the MacBook, which was discontinued in 2019, would make sense as it provides a way to introduce the new design, without disrupting the existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.
Apple made a 12-inch version of its MacBook in 2015, updating it in 2017, before finally discontinuing the aging notebook in 2019 and selling only the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptops. Each of the three iterations were powered by low-end Intel mobile CPUs in an effort to keep costs low and extend battery life of the compact notebooks. Another Apple notebook, the MacBook Air, was touted as remarkably light and thin. Oddly, the 12-inch MacBook was both lighter and thinner than the MacBook Air.

Apple is expected to continue the 12-inch MacBook line with a new model based on Apple Silicon, the term used for the CPUs that Apple designs itself. While it is based on the Arm architecture used by many mobile processors, Apple has made significant changes which place its processors in a league of their own. Specs, prices and colors of the new MacBook have been listed by well-known Apple leaker, Komiya, on Twitter. Much of this has been corroborated in a recent article in The China Times, offering Apple supply chain vendors as a source. The article noted that TSMC has usurped the 5nm manufacturing capacity that Huawei needed, in order to fill Apple's order for its A14 processor. This Apple CPU was described as being used in several devices including the iPhone 12, MacBook and iMac desktop computer.

If the leaks prove true, the new 12-inch MacBook will have more speed potential than the previous models, featuring the new A14X CPU, a more powerful variant of the A14 expected in the coming iPhone 12. This should deliver more processing power, better graphics, longer battery life and cooler operation than comparable Intel processors. It should be noted that until apps are recompiled for Apple Silicon, Apple's Rosetta adds an emulator layer, causing a slow down as much as 50-percent, when compared with executing native code.
The new MacBook is rumored to come with up to 16-gigabytes RAM, 512-gigabytes SSD, weigh two pounds, and be available in Silver, Gold, and Space Gray colors. Pricing is expected to be as low as $849. Battery life is said to reach up to 20 hours, possibly the strongest selling point of the new system. Apple promised an Apple Silicon based Mac this year, so the announcement should come soon, most likely at the rumored October event which will feature the upcoming iPhone 12. Apple has clearly stated that future Macs will be powered by Apple Silicon, so all eyes will be on this new device. Starting with what was originally a low power notebook eases speed expectations and lowers the cost of entry, making the 12-inch MacBook a very wise way for Apple to begin the transition.
