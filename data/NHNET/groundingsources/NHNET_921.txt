HARRISBURG, Pa. ( ) — Acting Pennsylvania Health Secretary Alison Beam announced Wednesday that all Pennsylvanians will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine next month.
Joined by members of the legislative COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, Beam unveiled Gov. Tom Wolf's timeline which lays out how the the state will handle a large influx of Pennsylvanians seeking a shot.
On April 5, the state will expand eligibility to include everyone in Phase 1B.
On April 12, the state will expand eligibility to include everyone in Phase 1C.
And then on April 19, they will allow all Pennsylvanians to make an appointment.
A reminder of who qualifies under those phases: 1B includes clergy, manufacturing workers, shelters and correctional facilities staff. And a reminder about 1C: that is all PA's essential workers or those who cannot perform their duties without some kind of in person element like media, bank tellers, public health workers and construction.
Beam says this is all happening because supply has improved.
"As the federal government's role has increased, Pennsylvania is again adapting. As more providers receive vaccine, whether from the state allocation or from direct federal allocation, we will continually be updating the online provider map to help people find vaccine near them,” Beam said.
