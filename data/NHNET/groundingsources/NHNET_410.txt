Anurag Basu's Ludo act
Anurag Basu Plays A Part In Ludo
Anurag Basu’s delightful ensemble cast in Ludo is an acting paradise. But tucked away in the film’s melee of talent and charisma is the director himself, playing the film’s sutradhar who compares life to a game of ,you guessed it, ludo.
Basu’s cameo has been kept a secret so far. But it’s now out that he is indeed a part of vast cast in Ludo in a very special role.
Interestingly this is not Anurag Basu’s first foray into acting. He had also played a pivotal part in Onir’s I Am in 2010 . His character was named after him, Dr Anurag Basu.
What is it that lures filmmakers to the other side of the camera? Guru Dutt never wanted to act. When Dilip Kumat stepped out of Pyasa at the last minute the director donned the actor’s role…and the rest is history. Now of course there is an avalanche of directors who take to acting mainly to experience what it feels like from the other side.
