Katie Price broke down in tears following six hours of surgery on her broken feet.

Her head was in her hands and her long blonde hair fell to cover her face when emotions got the better of the former glamour model.
More procedures than the reality queen had hoped had to be carried out on her injured feet.
Gruelling six hours of surgery was performed to help get Katie back on her feet again as soon as possible.
