Wearing a face mask in shops and takeaways in England is now compulsory after the law changed last week to help stop the spread of coronavirus.
The change means some customers now visiting McDonald’s will need to wear a mask - but not all of them.
With McDonald’s used by customers in different ways, different rules apply to those visiting the fast food giant.
While some people choose to eat in at McDonald’s, others visit to collect a takeaway and then there’s the drive thru users.
So if you’re not sure what to do when getting your next McDonald's fix, here’s the latest rules which the fast food chain has confirmed to customers on its social media channels. Those who ignore the rules, risk a £100 fine.
