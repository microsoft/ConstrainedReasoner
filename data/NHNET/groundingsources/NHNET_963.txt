The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved two Lysol disinfectant products that effectively kill the novel coronavirus on surfaces.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently issued a list of 431 products that are effective at killing viruses on surfaces. That list has been updated to include two Lysol products that have been specifically shown to kill the coronavirus on surfaces, helping to prevent the spread of the virus.
The two products are Lysol Disinfectant Spray and Lysol Disinfectant Max Cover Mist. In a press release, the agency said that the two products had both proved successful in laboratory testing at preventing the spread of the virus.
These two Lysol products are the first to be tested directly against the virus causing the Covid-19 global pandemic and proven to be effective. The EPA plans to do more testing on other products that kill the coronavirus but for now Lysol is the only product with the lab work done and reviewed by the EPA to show it is one hundred percent effective against the new coronavirus.
Lysol needs two minutes to work against the coronavirus
The EPA explained that it important not to simply spray the disinfectant and wipe it away as that may not kill the virus. Tests showed the product was effective after two minutes, which means spraying it, leaving it, and then vigorously scrubbing need to be done to ensure the spray remove the coronavirus. WIth EPA approval, the company is now has able to advertise on its label that it can kill the novel coronavirus.
Warning not to inject Lysol
Previously in the pandemic President Donald Trump suggested drinking or injecting Lysol to kill the coronavirus but health experts were quick to warn people not to actually do it because it can cause severe damage to the human body.
