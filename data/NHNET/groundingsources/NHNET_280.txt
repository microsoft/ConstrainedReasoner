Dunkin' Brands Group Inc., the parent company of Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins, has confirmed that it held preliminary discussions to be acquired by Inspire Brands. There is no certainty that any agreement will be reached, and the company said in a news release that it would not comment further unless a transaction is agreed upon or discussions are terminated.
With more than 21,000 points of distribution in more than 60 countries worldwide, Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. was, at the end of Q2 2020, 100% franchised including more than 13,000 Dunkin' restaurants and approximately 8,000 Baskin-Robbins restaurants. Dunkin' Brands is headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts.
The New York Times reported that the deal under discussion would see the company go private at a rate of $106.50 a share.
Inspire Brands, which owns Arby's, Sonic, Jimmy John's, Buffalo Wild Wings and Rusty Taco, with approximately 11,000 restaurants across all brands, was formed in 2018 by private equity firm Roark Capital as a holding company after Arby's completed the acquisition of Buffalo Wild Wings.
Neither Dunkin' Brands nor Inspire Brands had responded to requests for comment.
