seeing a pot of killer whales is definitely up there when it comes to once in a lifetime experiences. But how about when one of those hungry orcas chase a penguin right onto the deck of your boat? These whale watchers were enjoying a photo op around the Gerlach straight in Antarctica when some curious killer whales made their way into the area. But it wasn't just a pose for these tourist Instagram's. These orcas were on the hunt for some penguins, and almost as soon as they arrived, the marine mammals spotted their prey. Oh, no. The little bird began swimming for its life, flying out of the sea as fast as its water wings would take him until she took refuge in one of the tour boats. Tourists on the vessel then got an up close and personal look at this, a scared little Gentoo penguin who is happy to right along and rest while avoiding the killer orca. Onlookers say the whales followed closely behind the boat for a while, but eventually gave up and swam away, leaving this little penguin to swim another day.
