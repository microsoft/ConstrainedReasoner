The StopAntisemitism.org watchdog didn't seem to think Brown's apology very sincere, suggesting that the Food Network suspend him."Alton Brown is sorry he got called out for his vile Holocaust rhetoric," the watchdog said in a tweet. “And the only thing he’s trying to do with his ‘apology’ is save his multi-million-dollar FoodNetwork and Discovery contract.”
