The iPhone 12 launches in Hong Kong and will be ready for pre-order as soon as October 16 at Apple Hong Kong stores—here's everything you need to know about the "new era of iPhones"
All the new iPhone 12 models have OLED screens with Super Retina XDR display—the best iPhone display yet. Expect vastly more contrast of 2 million to 1, more colour accuracy and a jump in pixel density. The OLED screens also have higher resolution and twice the peak brightness of the iPhone 11.
Both the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 feature a new dual-camera system which includes a 12-megapixel f/1.6 main camera—the fastest aperture in any iPhone to date and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide. On the other hand, both the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone Pro Max are equipped with an incredible triple-camera system with 12-megapixel wide, telephone and even ultra-wide camera lens.
The wide and ultra-wide cameras also now have a night mode to capture low-light shots and it also automatically senses when light is low. The new wide camera allows 27 per cent more light so regardless if you take photos during the day or night, the details are maximised and colours appear vibrant. The Smart HDR 3 also helps balance the elements in the shot and through machine learning is able to recognise scenes automatically adjusting sharpness, colour and white balance when needed.
When you use the portrait mode, you can choose from six creative lighting effects such as high-key light mono, natural light and studio light. Night mode is also now available on the front camera.
For videos, you can record 4K HDR video with Dolby vision up to 30 frames per second and get 60x more colours with 10-bit video recording.
