ASUS has officially revealed images of three of it’s upcoming Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 custom graphics card designs.
With the official launch of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 having been pushed back until October 29th, a date that through pure coincidence (we’re sure) just happens to be the day after AMD launches its Radeon 6000 GPUs, there is clearly a lot of anticipation surrounding both of these graphics cards, but perhaps a little more towards the 3070. This is particularly so when you consider that Nvidia has said that they’ll be at least as good as a 2080 Ti while only costing around £450 (for Founders Edition designs anyway).
With this change in date, however, this clearly has given custom AIB partners more time to finalize their designs and marketing, but put simply, pretty much everyone at this point is seemingly twiddling their thumbs until that date hits. Well, if you wanted some news regarding the 3070, ASUS has happily obliged us by releasing images of three of their custom GPU designs.

Although no specifications for the designs have yet been confirmed, through images released we have confirmation of the following ASUS GeForce 3070 GPU designs:
TUF GAMING
ROG STRIX
3070 DUAL
The only moderately disappointing (albeit not entirely surprising) reveal we see in these images is that, by and large, the designs will be pretty much the same seen with their 3080 graphics cards. Albeit, none of them are unattractive so, I guess if it’s not broken, why attempt to fix it?

When Will We Know More?
With the formal release of the Nvidia 3070 set for October 29th, this will likely also represent the date in which embargos are lifted and where specifications and performance levels will finally be confirmed.
