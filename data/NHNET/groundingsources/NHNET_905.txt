Meghan McCain made a Lib.
The outspoken Republican and co-host of “The View” welcomed her first child with husband Ben Domenech Monday, a baby girl named Liberty Sage.
“We are excited to share the happy news,” “The View” tweeted Monday night, announcing the birth. “Congratulations Meghan and Ben.”
McCain, 35, and Domenech, the 38-year-old co-founder of the right-wing blog The Federalist, announced the pregnancy in March, but have shared few updates along the way after McCain claimed she was worried about online vitriol.
“Given that people write on photos I put up of my family they are glad my Dad got cancer and he’s in hell, I thought I would leave my unborn child out of the social media cess pool as much as is possible,” she wrote on Instagram in May.
“I believe children have a right to privacy and hope you will all understand as we navigate this as much as possible going forward without sacrificing our comfort or safety.”
The new parents tied the knot in November 2017 at her family’s ranch, less than a year before her father, former Sen. John McCain, died of cancer.
McCain, who was still appearing on “The View” through the end of last week, is expected to take maternity leave and will have a rotation of temporary fill-ins for her seat at the table, ABC previously announced.
