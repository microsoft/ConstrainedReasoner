Sadie Robertson has announced that she is expecting her first child with her husband Christian!
Duck Dynasty star turned author and motivational speaker Sadie Robertson has announced that she is expecting her first child with her husband Christian Huff.
The Live Original founder is clearly very excited to be welcoming her first child. To begin her caption, she wrote, “SCREAMING WITH EXCITEMENT TO SHARE THIS NEWS!” The beaming smile on her face in the picture indicates her elation as well!
The news comes just under a year after Sadie and Christian tied the knot. The couple was married on Sadie’s family farm in Louisiana in November of 2019. Christian popped the question in June of that same year, just about a year after the couple began dating in the summer of 2018.
Congratulations to Sadie and Christian on growing their family! We wish them all the best as they prepare to welcome their first child into the world.
