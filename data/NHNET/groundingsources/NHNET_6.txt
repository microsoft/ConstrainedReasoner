Under current Government guidelines, secondary school pupils have to wear masks in areas of England where lockdown restrictions have been imposed.
Face coverings will now have to be worn in communal areas of secondary schools in Leeds.
Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the guidelines are based on updated advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO) saying children aged over 12 should wear masks.
What is the new guidance?

The World Health Organisation published a statement on 21 August advising that “children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.”
The Government has chosen to follow this guidance for areas that are under stricter lockdown measures.
Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson said: "Our priority is to get children back to school safely. At each stage we have listened to the latest medical and scientific advice.
"We have therefore decided to follow the World Health Organisation’s new advice. In local lockdown areas children in year 7 and above should wear face coverings in communal spaces.

"Outside of local lockdown areas face coverings won’t be required in schools, though schools will have the flexibility to introduce measures if they believe it is right in their specific circumstances."
What if my child lives in a non-lockdown area but goes to school in a lockdown area?
They will need to wear a mask.
Where in school will they need to wear a mask?
In communal areas such as hallways and dining rooms.
Children will also need to wear masks on school buses as masks are mandatory on public transport.
Do they need to wear them in the classroom?
No, pupils will not need to wear them in the classroom, even when social distancing is not possible, according to the government advice.

The government guidance says: "On the basis of current evidence, in light of the mitigating measures education settings are taking, and the negative impact on communication, face coverings will not generally be necessary in the classroom even where social distancing is not possible.
"There is greater use of the system of controls for minimising risk, including through keeping in small and consistent groups or bubbles, and greater scope for physical distancing by staff within classrooms.
"Face coverings can have a negative impact on learning and teaching and so their use in the classroom should be avoided."
What age group needs to wear a mask?
Children in secondary school will need to wear a mask.
The guidance is for children aged 12 upwards to wear a mask which covers Year 7 students up to college and sixth form students.

There is no guidance for primary school students to wear a mask.
What if I don't have a mask?
Where a student or staff member is struggling to access a mask, or if it soiled or unsafe, the guidance says that schools should take steps to have a “small contingency supply” available, adding no-one should excluded on the grounds that they are not wearing a face covering.
Is anyone exempt from wearing a mask?
