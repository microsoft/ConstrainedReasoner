The EF3 tornado hit Saturday afternoon.
Surveyors have found damage at hundreds of homes following Saturday's tornado in Jonesboro.
Officials say about 150 homes were mostly or completely destroyed in the EF-3 tornado. More than 300 homes sustained minor damage. The twister also directly hit The Mall at Turtle Creek, causing an estimated $100 million in damage.
The mall had been closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, and officials said that closure likely saved lives.
