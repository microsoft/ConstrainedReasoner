Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan ’s statement was recorded by the police in a case of impersonation that he had filed five years ago. He had filed a complaint against an unidentified person for allegedly creating a fake email account in his (Roshan’s) name, and for using the same to send multiple messages to actress Kangana Ranaut in 2013 and 2014.Attired in a black T-shirt and jeans, Roshan arrived at the city police headquarters at Crawford Market around 11.45 am on Saturday.He left the premises three hours later — around 2.40 pm. His statement was recorded by officials of the criminal intelligence unit, a wing of the crime branch of Mumbai police.The case was earlier being probed by officials of the cyber-crime police station at Bandra-Kurla Complex. Roshan had, in his complaint, stated: “Someone impersonating me has sent mails through a fake email address.” After registering the case, the police had taken the actor’s laptop and cellphone for investigation.Last December, Roshan’s lawyer approached senior police officials about the pending investigation after which the case was transferred. The crime branch had issued summons, asking the actor to appear and give his statement.
