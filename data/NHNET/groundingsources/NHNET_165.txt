Americans start to head to the polls to vote in one of the most anticipated elections in US history. Look back over the live blog.
Absentee voting during the pandemic has changed the vote-counting timeline, and there aren't uniform practices for counting across the states.
That makes it difficult to predict when certain key battlegrounds might be called.
For example, Pennsylvania and Michigan — battlegrounds Trump won by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 — aren't expected to have complete totals for days.
Florida and North Carolina, meanwhile, began processing early ballots ahead of time, with officials there forecasting earlier unofficial returns.
But those two states also could have razor-thin margins.
Early returns, meanwhile, could show divergent results.
Mail-in ballots are expected to heavily favour Democrats, while ballots cast today are expected to be more likely to favour Republicans.
US media outlet Axios reported this week that Mr Trump told close advisors he intended to declare victory on election day if it looked like he was ahead.
He denied the report, but said: "I think it's terrible that we can't know the results of an election the night of the election."
