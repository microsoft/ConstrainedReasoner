Texas’ coronavirus case total jumped this week in part due to nearly 1,500 infections among state prisoners that had not been previously counted in statewide tallies.
On Tuesday, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported that the total number of coronavirus cases increased by more than 4,000. Of those, about 2,600 are new and the rest were previously excluded infections among inmates in two counties: 887 in Anderson County and 589 in Brazoria County.

Department spokesman Chris Van Deusen told The Dallas Morning News the prison cases date back to March.

“These weren’t cases that were diagnosed yesterday,” Van Deusen said Wednesday.

About 7,500 inmates at state-run jails and prisons have caught COVID-19, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, and 54 have died. More than 2,200 are currently sick, the lowest reported number of active cases reported since the prison agency began widespread testing in May.

The Texas Observer first reported the discrepancy in early May, noting a spike at the Beto Unit in Anderson County that did not appear in the county’s published totals. Community Impact Newspaper reported last week that Brazoria County had stopped including sick prisoners in its count.
Then, last week, the state health department sent both counties a letter demanding they include state prison cases in their totals. All prison cases are now accounted for in state totals, Van Deusen said, adding the discrepancy wasn’t fixed earlier because “it’s just been a difficult nut to crack. We’ve been working on it for a number of weeks and trying to determine, what’s the best solution?”
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which oversees state prisons, has been reporting prisoner coronavirus cases online for months.

But Anderson County Judge Robert Johnston told The News counting prisoners in his totals “exaggerates” his local numbers. Not including the prison, Anderson County has had one new case in the last five days, he said. But adding the last two months of prisoner infections increased the county total from about 100 to more than 800 total cases.

“It can be a little alarming to people. I’ve already had a couple people call and say, ‘what in the world?’” Johnston said Wednesday. “The average person looks at the [state health department’s online coronavirus] dashboard and says, ‘this is what’s walking the streets of this county.’”
Brazoria County Judge Matt Sebesta said he stopped counting prison cases last week with the blessing of the local arm of the state health department. He said there’s been a “breakdown in communication” during the pandemic, especially with the prisons agency.

“After TDCJ moved 128 positive inmates into this county and I found out after the fact, I mean, they lost all credibility with me. And their attitude dealing with us has been extraordinarily dismissive,” Sebesta said, referring to the prison agency’s decision to move more than 100 inmates into Brazoria County prisons without notifying local officials.
“I am so frustrated with TDCJ and their arrogance in not wanting to work with the locals. I’m just washing my hands of them,” he said.
Sebesta said while local totals on the state health website now include prisoners, he won’t be reporting those cases on his county dashboard. He doesn’t trust the data from the prison agency, and thinks it’s at best outdated and at worst, flat out wrong.
“I will not — I will not — put TDCJ numbers back on our public dashboard that we’re putting out to our citizens. Ain’t gonna happen,” he said.

In a statement, prison agency spokesman Robert Hurst said TDCJ has been “committed to being transparent and sharing information with stakeholders, including local officials” during the pandemic.
“The agency maintains a public-facing dashboard and engages county officials when they bring issues forward. The agency stands ready to be a resource should there be an unmet need locally,” Hurst added.
