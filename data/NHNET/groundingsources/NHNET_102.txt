Another 25 people have died with coronavirus in Wales and nearly 1,900 new positive cases have been identified.
Latest figures from Public Health Wales published on Monday, January 4 show 1,898 new cases of the virus have been recorded to bring the total since the pandemic began to 157,209. The overall death total now stands at 3,645 in Wales.
Following the latest figures, the infection rate is now 451.1 cases per 100,000 people based on the seven days up to December 30. That is a slight rise on the 445.7 previously.
These figures are based on the date tests were done, not the date test results were included on the system. The data is correct up to 9am on January 3.
Public Health Wales has urged people to consider day-to-day fluctuations with caution as "data flow issues" may affect the figures. Figures over the weekend were higher than what might be expected due to a backlog because of delays in how information was released over the New Year.
The percentage of tests being done that produce positive results is now 25.6% in Wales, meaning a quarter of people getting tested have the virus. This number is slowly rising back towards a peak of 27% on December 13.
The latest figures come following news that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has authorised the use of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine with its rollout across Wales starting today and 40,000 doses due over the next two weeks.

All of Wales is now in full lockdown at alert level four which means that:
people must stay at home, except for very limited purposes
people must not visit other households, or meet other people they do not live with
many types of businesses are required to close.
The level four restrictions apply to the whole of Wales and will be reviewed at the end of this week but very little is likely to change and lockdown in Wales could remain in place until the end of January.
The Welsh Government has announced that those who are shielding should no longer attend work or school outside the home.

Dr Giri Shankar, incident director for the novel coronavirus outbreak response at Public Health Wales, said: “We wish everyone a Happy New Year, and hope that 2021 will be a better year for us all. With vaccinations for COVID-19 progressing, we welcome the announcement by the Welsh Government of the roll-out of the second Coronavirus vaccine (from Oxford/AstraZeneca) in Wales, which starts this week.
“The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has issued a short statement outlining the case for optimising the vaccine programme within the UK to achieve maximum short term impact.
“Vaccinating the adult population of Wales, to protect people from severe disease, is a significant task, and the vaccine will take time to reach everyone. The epidemiology of COVID-19 throughout the UK in late 2020 showed a clear need for rapid, high levels of vaccine uptake among vulnerable persons.
“The JCVI supports a two-dose vaccine schedule for the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines. Given the data available, and evidence from the use of many other vaccines, Public Health Wales fully supports the JCVI advice to increase a maximum interval between the first and second doses of 12 weeks for both vaccines.
“It can be assumed that protection from the first dose will wane in the medium term, and the second dose will still be required to provide more durable protection. The JCVI advises initially prioritising delivery of the first vaccine dose as this is highly likely to have a greater public health impact in the short term and reduce the number of preventable deaths from COVID-19.
“Members of the public should not to phone your GP, pharmacy or hospital asking when they will get a vaccine. When someone is in one of the groups eligible for the vaccine, they will be invited to attend a dedicated clinic which will have been set up to ensure patient safety and that of the healthcare professionals.
“The effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for some time, and with Wales at alert level four we must continue to follow the advice on keeping Wales safe. Stay at home, meet only the people you live with, maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and work from home if you can."
