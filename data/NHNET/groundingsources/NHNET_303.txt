A rare lunar event will take place on Halloween this year.
According to the Farmer’s Almanac, a rare Halloween Blue Hunter’s Moon will take place in 2020.
Despite its name, the moon will not actually be blue.
A blue moon is a rare occasion when two full moons appear in the same month. On average, the phenomenon happens every two-and-a-half to three years.
In October, the first full moon will take place on Oct. 1 and the second on Oct. 31.
According to the Farmer’s Almanac, a full moon on Halloween occurs roughly once every 19 years. According to astronomers, the next full moon on Halloween will take place in 2039.
