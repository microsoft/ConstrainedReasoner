Former Peter Parker actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield have both reportedly signed on to appear in Spider-Man 3.
We’ve heard rumors over the past week or so that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield might return to the role that put them both on the map. But now, it looks like it’s official. According to FandomWire, the actors are reportedly locked in to return as Peter Parker alongside Tom Holland’s current portrayal of the character in Spider-Man 3.

Apparently, Doctor Strange will serve as the conduit to bring these three versions of the web-slinger together on the big screen, thereby creating the first live-action Spider-Verse in history. Furthermore, it’s said that Maguire and Garfield are set to appear in the final act of the film in order to help defeat the combined villains from each of their respective series.
This likely means we’ll also see a lot of other familiar faces returning to the Big Apple. We already know Jamie Foxx will be suiting up as Electro once again for the flick and could potentially be joined by Tom Hardy’s Venom, Dane DeHaan’s Green Goblin, Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin and more. Kirsten Dunst might even be back as Mary Jane Watson if the studio has their way.
Despite this planned reintroduction of past Spider-Men, the franchise still definitively belongs to just one man. In fact, we’ve heard that Sony is currently trying to lock Holland in for many more pics as the titular web-head. And with the way the upcoming threequel is shaping up, it’s becoming pretty clear that they have big plans for him.
Tell us, though, are you excited to see these three heroes join forces in Spider-Man 3, or would you rather the MCU stick to just one Peter Parker? Sound off in the comments section down below and let us know what you think!
