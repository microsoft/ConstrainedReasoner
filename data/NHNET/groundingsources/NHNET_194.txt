Dwayne Johnson’s upcoming DC project Black Adam got an exciting addition to its cast in the form of the new Hawkman, Aldis Hodge. Hodge is a SAG award-winning actor with multiple projects across film and television, including 2020 film hits The Invisible Man, One Night in Miami and the recently revived television show Leverage.
Although the film centers around titular character Black Adam, featured in comics as Shazam’s nemesis, the film will be introducing a whole new set of DC superheroes, including Hodge’s character Hawkman. Hawkman, aka Carter Hall, is a member of the Justice Society of America (JSA). The JSA is a group of superheroes that acted as a prelude to the Justice League in DC Comics, and will be featured in the film in a manner yet to be confirmed, although it sounds like they will be placed in opposition to Johnson’s anti-hero Black Adam in some way. So far the film has confirmed appearances from JSA members Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo), Doctor Fate (TBD), and Cyclone (TBD) with the possibility of more to come.
Black Adam will be directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed Johnson in the upcoming Disney adventure film Jungle Cruise, and is expected to begin production in Georgia early in 2021. As mentioned above, little is known about the story itself and casting is still underway, so keep an eye on this space for updates. For now, fans can rest easy knowing that the character of Hawkman is in good hands with Aldis Hodge.
