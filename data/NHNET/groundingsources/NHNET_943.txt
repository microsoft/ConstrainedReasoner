The first trailer for Dune has an official release date and will premiere on Twitter.
The first trailer for Denis Villeneuve’s Dune will premiere tomorrow, September 9, directly on Twitter . This is the first real look at the highly-anticipated sci-fi adaptation of the novel from author Frank Herbert. For now, here's a 45-seconds teaser.

Tomorrow’s trailer premiere will be the first footage for Villeneuve’s adaptation which features an all-star cast that includes Timothee Chalamet, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, and more. Villeneuve previously directed other sci-fi films such as Arrival and Blade Runner 2049.Dune is a film adaptation of Herbert’s 1965 novel of the same name. Dune is a space opera set in the far future about various noble houses in distant galaxies as they vie for control of the planet Arrakis and its valuable resource, a drug called “the spice.”There was also a 1984 film adaptation by David Lynch starring Kyle McLachlan. It wasn’t very well received, though it has gone on to achieve some kind of cult status.

Dune is still scheduled to be released on December 18, 2020, though given the shifting landscape of theater releases it’s unclear if these plans will remain in place. Warner Bros, who is distributing Dune, released Tenet as a theaters-only premiere so the same strategy could be used for Dune.
