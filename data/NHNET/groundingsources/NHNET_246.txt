Getty Rick Moranis made a surprise appearance a new Mint Mobile ad after stepping out of the spotlight years ago.
Fans can thank “massive” fan Ryan Reynolds for the cameo!
In the commercial Ryan tells viewers, "It's hard to believe that Mint Mobile has gone so long without an unlimited plan. So, to introduce it, we brought in an actor we've all gone too long without: Rick Moranis."
Next, Rick walks on camera and asks, “So what do you want me to do, say something about Mint?”
Ryan answers, “No… that would have been smart.” When Rick asks why he's there, Reynolds tells him, “I'm a huge fan… massive.”
“That's it?” Moranis asks.
Ryan answers, “That's it,” as Rick says goodbye.
