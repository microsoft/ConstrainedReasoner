Chris Hemsworth shared a hilariously odd photo of Thor: Love and Thunder director Taika Waititi at the MCU film's first script reading.
Thor star Chris Hemsworth posted a photo of director Taika Waititi wrapped in a blanket and sprawled out on the grass floor outside during Thor: Love and Thunder's first official script meeting.
"Terrific first script meeting for 'Thor Love and Thunder' with our ever fearless leader Taika Waititi," Hemsworth captioned the photo. "My notes were so detailed and intense that the only way for Taika to fully absorb them was to roll himself into a tight cocoon and bake in the endless possibilities of where the film will take us. The bloke in the background was equally riveted by my storytelling prowess."

Hemsworth's confirmation of Love and Thunder's first script reading comes shortly after his verifying that filming for the anticipated fourth installment in the Thor series is set to begin in Australia in January of 2021.
Little is known about the film's plot other than that it will spin off from the events of Avengers: Endgame and feature Thor: Ragnarok costar Tessa Thompson's return as Valkyrie, as well as mark the return Natalie Portman's character, Jane Foster, from the first two Thor films.
While it has been long since confirmed that Love and Thunder will see Jane Foster assume the mantel of Thor, as the character did in Marvel comics, Portman also recently let slip that the Jane will be undergoing cancer treatment in the movie as well -- affirming that the plot will faithfully adapt that key aspect of the character from the comic book run.
Directed by Taika Waititi, Thor: Love and Thunder stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie and Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. The film arrives in theaters Feb. 11, 2022.
