From Kate Winslet's recent interview in @THR: “I had to learn how to free-dive to play that role in Avatar, and that was just incredible. My longest breath hold was seven minutes and 14 seconds, like crazy, crazy stuff.” pic.twitter.com/ZYAmZdNgHS — Avatar (@officialavatar) October 26, 2020 ×

To prepare for her Avatar 2 role, Winslet had to step outside of her comfort zone to get used to being underwater for long period of time. In an interview dated August, she said, "I had to learn how to free-dive to play that role in Avatar, and that was just incredible... My longest breath hold was seven minutes and 14 seconds, like crazy, crazy stuff."
On her collaboration with James Cameron, Kate said, "It was so wonderful to work with Jim again. Time has changed him. Jim has become a father a few more times over. He is a calmer person. Chilled. You can just feel him enjoying it more this time."
