DETROIT -- Toyota says it has recalled roughly 752,000 Prius models due to a fail-safe issue that may cause the engine to lose power and stall. According to the Associated Press, the recall applies to certain 2013 to 2015 Prius and 2014 to 2017 Prius v hybrids. Approximately 267,000 vehicles in the U.S. will be impacted by the recall.
Toyota says the vehicles are designed to go into the fail-safe mode whenever there is a problem with hybrid system. However, an issue in the system doesnâ€™t allow the vehicle to always go into fail-safe mode and the engine could then lose power and stall. The power steering and braking systems would remain in tact, meaning drivers would have some control over the vehicle still.
However, if the engine were to lose power and stall at a high rate of speed, it would increase the risk of a crash.
Dealers will update the software in the vehicles at no cost to the customer. Owners will be notified of the recall in late August, according to the AP.
