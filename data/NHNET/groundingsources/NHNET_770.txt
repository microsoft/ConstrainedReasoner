A report by PetaPixel mentions that the camera is similar to the RX100 series. The only difference is that Sony ZV-1 comes with a flip screen and a better microphone.
The ZV-1 weighs 294 grams and is Sonyâ€™s first compact camera with a flip-out, tiltable LCD screen. It comes with a MI (Multi Interface) Shoe to attach external microphones without using an additional mounting bracket.

The camera includes advances in image stabilisation that ensures steady video even when recorded hand-held while walking. When shooting in HD (Active mode), the camera combines both optical and electronic stabilisation methods to minimise shaking up to 11 times that of standard SteadyShot.
