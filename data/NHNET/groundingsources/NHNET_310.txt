Halsey has never been one to mince words, openly sharing her difficulties with homelessness, mental illness, and drugs. Her latest album was titled Manic.
Celebrities are tackling their lockdown boredom by participating in a fun challenge which involves fans asking them to post photos depicting various moments in their lives, such as when they got engaged or felt their most confident. Halsey was given a prompt for "you at your lowest point" and responded with a topless mirror selfie, captioning it, "TW: ED, ask for help," as Just Jared confirmed. She soon removed the pic after intense fan backlash over the graphic, potentially triggering content.
The singer-songwriter subsequently took to Twitter to apologize, writing, "TW: disordered eating. I am very sorry for posting a photo of myself depicting my struggle with ED without a sufficient trigger warning. I was very nervous to post it and didn't think properly." Halsey assured fans, "I had positive intentions. I would never want to harm someone who shares my struggle." She followed up with a note, advising, "im gonna log off now because this has turned into something I am not emotionally equipped to handle for the time being. I hope that's okay."
