UKâ€™s Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have broken their silence after the bombshell interview of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
The snap shared on Kensington Royal shows the UK monarch while she delivered a message about "unity" and "friendship". While Prince Harry and Meghan's interview aired on CBS on Sunday night, Queen Elizabeth spoke about the importance of keeping in touch with the family and friends amid "testing times" such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Prince William and Kate captioned the image, "Today is Commonwealth Day. The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 54 independent countries. Her Majesty The Queen is Head of the Commonwealth."
