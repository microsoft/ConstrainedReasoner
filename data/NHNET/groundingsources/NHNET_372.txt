Jamie Lynn Spears is sticking up and showing support for her sister Britney Spears.
Following the outpouring of love for Britney in response to the New York Times’ unauthorized documentary, Framing Britney Spears, the Zoey 101 alum set a cautionary message to the media.
"Dear media, try not to repeat the mistakes of your past. Look where that got us. Do better," Jamie wrote in an Instagram Story Friday (February 12). "Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always.”
Jamie also used the moment to quash “false” stories claiming she participated in a virtual #FreeBritney rally.
“A few media outlets ran a false story about me attending a virtual rally yesterday. In fact, someone represented themselves as me without my knowledge,” wrote Jamie. "I love my sister very much, but I was not aware of a rally, nor was I in attendance for a virtual rally.”
