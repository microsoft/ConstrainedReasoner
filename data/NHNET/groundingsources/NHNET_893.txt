Several months after the introduction of EA Play to Xbox Game Pass, EA are bringing their games to Game Pass for PC. As you may know, EA Play is already available on PC via Origin but with the introduction to Game Pass for PC, players will get a large selection of EA titles without having to spend extra money by buying the subscription individually. It's certainly a neat addition that many Game Pass owners on PC will appreciate.
EA Play includes some of the biggest games released by the publisher, including FIFA, Madden, Need for Speed and Battlefield series. Of course, the basic tier does not include brand new titles such but after a couple of months, each of these new releases usually end up on EA Play.
