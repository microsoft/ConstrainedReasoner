Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump is upset that his campaign legal team, currently led by his flopsweating and hairdrippy personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, is comprised of "fools that are making him look bad," NBC news reports.

On Sunday before Powell got the axe, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a close Trump ally and former top federal prosecutor, called the president's legal team a "national embarrassment."

"Who the f— knows?" that person said to NBC News.
