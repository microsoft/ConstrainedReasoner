The Truth Behind Cardi B's Comments About Melania Trump
Cardi B is not one to shy away from conflict, especially when it comes to her critics. Case in point: The Bronx-born rapper's name became a trending topic on Twitter when she addressed comments that compared her to first lady Melania Trump. It all started on Aug. 25, 2020, when many Republicans across the country commended Melania's speech at the Republican National Convention, an address that was undoubtedly more original than her 2016 version. Failed congressional candidate and self-described "conservative-warrior," DeAnna Lorraine, was just one person who took to Twitter to show her support, writing, "America needs far more women like Melania Trump and far less like Cardi B."
Cardi B, an outspoken opponent of many President Donald Trump's policies, did not take the insult lying down. "Didn't she used to sell that Wap?" Cardi tweeted in response. For the uninitiated, that's a reference to Cardi B's hit single with Megan Thee Stallion, "WAP," which stands for "Wet A– P—y." The possible implication being that the first lady was once a sex worker, which isn't a new allegation, as the Trumps sued the Daily Mail in 2016 for publishing a now-retracted report that suggested Melania "provided services beyond simply modeling," as an apology from the outlet stated.
Lorraine called Cardi a liar in response, telling her she should be ashamed. Cardi, who is rarely ashamed of anything, did not back down. Instead, she tweeted a pic from a nude photoshoot Melania Trump did in the 90s.
So what did Twitter have to say? As it turns out, a lot of people have strong opinions about the situation.
