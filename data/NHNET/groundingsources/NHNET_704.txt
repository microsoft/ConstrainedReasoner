NEW DELHI: As announced by the Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, domestic flight services will resume from Monday (May 25, 2020) as part of the Centre's efforts to gradually open the air travel for the public that was halted two months ago on account of a lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

The minister further said that the government will try to start a good percentage of international passenger flights before August. Puri also informed that the Centre is planning to bring back Indian citizens from Sri Lanka either by ship or flights. Discussions are at an advanced stage, the Aviation Minister said.
As per the announcement, the first domestic flight will take off from Terminal 3 of Delhi airport around 4.30 early morning. In the first phase, 28 domestic flights will take off from Delhi for various destinations across the country.
Ahead of the resumption of domestic flight operations, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has released a new Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) for airports.
The passengers will have to reach the airport minimum two hours prior to departure and only those passengers will be allowed to enter the terminal who have their flight scheduled in the next four hours. All passengers will have to wear protective gear such as gloves and masks while entering the airport.
The air travellers have been advised to carry their boarding passes along with them. It has also been made mandatory for the air travellers to upload the Aarogya Setu App in the mobile phones failing which they will have to sign an undertaking that they are free from Coronavirus infection.
