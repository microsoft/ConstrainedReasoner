Following her breakthrough role as Annie Banks, Williams-Paisley landed the lead in the short-lived ABC drama Relativity. While the 1996 series wasn't a hit, she'd find success on the small screen five years later with a series regular role in the sitcom According to Jim. Though never a critical favorite, it did run for nearly a decade on ABC, eventually wrapping in 2009 after 182 episodes—three of which she directed. She's since had recurring parts on Nashville, Two and a Half Men and The Flash, starring roles in a handful of Hallmark Channel films, and appearances in the films We Are Marshall, How to Eat Fried Worms and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Trip. In 2016, she published Where the Light Gets In, which tells the story of her mother's diagnosis with primary progressive aphasia—a form of dementia—through her death. She's been married to country singer Brad Paisley since 2003. They are the parents to two sons, William Huckleberry and Jasper.
