This Bronco concept is built by Ford in collaboration with Filson to support the firefighters
Post the big debut, the Ford Bronco and its urban-alter ego are busy with various other activities. The Bronco Sport recently won the 2020 Rebelle Rally in its category in stock condition, and now Ford has announced the Bronco will don the emergency vehicle outfit to support the National Forest Foundation.
Ford has teamed up with Filson, an outdoor outfitter, to develop the Bronco Wildland Fire Rig Concept. It is customized with firefighting equipment and Ford will donate two examples for the cause.

What’s Different On The Outside?
It is equipped with the Sasquatch package as well. The Bronco is painted in Forest Service Green paint, similar to the one offered on the yesteryear first-gen U.S. Forest Service Bronco. Up front, the Bronco Wildland Fire Rig Concept features a steel bumper with a Warn Zeon 10s winch mounted atop it. A heavy-duty custom fabricated rack is present on the roof along with a RIGID LED light bar.
There are several accessory-ready points on the side rearview mirrors and rear J-plate. Firefighting equipment and accessories like a Pulaski, shovel, water tanks, and axes, are also placed in the Bronco. Filson’s expertise comes in handy as the Ford Bronco also comes with a Fire/Rescue Transport skid, a fire hose reel, a high-pressure water pump, and a 50-gallon water tank are mounted in the back. Apart from this, stuff like a chainsaw, two hard hats, a high lift jack, and a drip torch are also present.
What’s Different On The Inside?
There are a lot of changes on the inside as well. For starters, there is a lot of Filson stuff here, like the quilted black leather with the Bronco logo embossed on it. The same is seen on the canvas door bolsters, armrests, and seat trim surrounds as well. The Bronco logo on the steering wheel is finished in brass and Filson logos are placed on the center console trim tag and interior top.
Grab handles on the instrument panel and center console are painted in matching Filson otter green shade. Apart from this, there are things like a bring-your-own device rack on the instrument panel, fireproof ripstop nylon for bimini-style top and rear cargo area divider, and a CB radio, amongst other things.
What’s Under The Hood?
Ford didn’t announce which engine will power these rigs. It will be either the 2.3-liter, four-cylinder EcoBoost engine that makes 270 horses and 310 pound-feet of torque, or the 2.7-liter, V-6 EcoBoost mill that produces 310 ponies and 400 pound-feet of twist. Given that it will be used a lot in the forests and on the beaten paths, the manual gearbox with the crawler gear will be better suited.
The automaker mentioned that it will come equipped with the Sasquatch package, which is a good thing. Now that the manual gearbox is part of the Sasquatch package, here are the other things that are a part of it:
-* 1.2-inch Suspension Lift-Kit
-* Higher-Mounted Fender Flares
-* 17-inch Beadlock-Compatible Wheels
-* 35-inch Mud-Terrain Tires
-* Dana Front and Rear Locking Axles
-* An Electromechanical Transfer Case
-* Heavy-Duty Position-Sensitive Bilstein Shocks
-* 4.7:1 Final Drive Ratio
-* Two-inch Wider Track
Final Thoughts
Ford has launched many Bronco concepts already, but this one is the need of the hour. The Blue Oval collaboration with Filson to create an emergency rescue vehicle to protect America’s forests from the crazy wildfires is a noble thought. Ford mentioned in the press release that the Wildland Fire Rig Concept is developed to “celebrate wildland firefighters and support the National Forest Foundation”. The news comes during one of the most devastating fire seasons in the U.S., with 7.5 million acres already charred. Ford will be donating two of these Bronco Wildland Fire Rig Concept as part of the Bronco Wild Fund started to support the National Forest Foundation and Outward Bound U.S.A.
