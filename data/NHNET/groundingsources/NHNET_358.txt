Demi Lovato and her ex-fiancé Max Ehrich are clearly on different pages since splitting in September.
Demi Lovato is facing some "issues" with her ex-fiancé Max Ehrich since splitting in September.
The former couple, who called off their engagement after two months, have exhibited vastly different approaches to their breakup.
While Lovato has kept quiet about the circumstances surrounding their split, Ehrich has been vocalising his feelings on social media, claiming to have learned of their split "through a tabloid".
Yesterday, the actor was seen crying at the same Malibu beach where he proposed in July.

"She is having all sorts of issues with Max not leaving her alone," a source told E!
"He has been trying to get in contact with her family and friends and they have all blocked him. She's in contact with lawyers now on what to do."

Ehrlich has reportedly "tried to reach out" and is "in denial" that their relationship is finished.
"Demi is completely done and doesn't want to see him again at this point," the source said. "She can't believe she fell into his trap and is really upset over it."

Lovato and Ehrich began dating in March this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. On July 23, Lovato announced Ehrich had proposed in Malibu.
"When I was a little girl, my birth dad always called me his 'little partner' — something that might've sounded strange without his southern cowboy like accent," Lovato wrote alongside a photo of her engagement ring. "To me, it made perfect sense. And today that word makes perfect sense again but today I'm officially going to be someone else's partner."
