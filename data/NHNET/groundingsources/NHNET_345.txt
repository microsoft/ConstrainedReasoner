While the QuietComfort Earbuds aren't out yet, they already look like they could prove to be a challenger to Apple's premium AirPods Pro.
The Australian retailer Harvey Norman released a product advertisement video for the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, a possible challenger to Apple's AirPods. While the video and product have yet to be released by Bose itself, this is not the first time this particular set of headphones has surfaced online, although they were previously going by a different name.
Bose had previously referred to this product as the Noise Cancelling Earbuds 700 on its website. In this previous product overview, Bose explained that these earbuds would have a noise-canceling solution that would nearly equal the company's best noise-canceling headphones. The brief synopsis also highlighting that the headphones would include intuitive touch controls, a choice of a virtual assistant, and a portable charging case, as is standard for Bose’s wireless headphones.

As pointed out by CNET, the new video indicates that Bose has opted to rebrand the Noise Cancelling Earbuds 700 as the QuietComfort Earbuds. In the video, it is claimed that the new earbuds contain the world’s most effective noise-canceling technology. The earbuds also feature clear audio and bass and are both water and sweat resistant. In addition, the headphones are also shaped to perfectly conform to the wearer's ear, with “StayHear Max Tips” to both increase comfort and create a secure fit that won’t fall out. Other touted features include a custom-designed microphone array that helps to increase call quality and battery life that's rated to last up to six hours on a single charge.
QuietComfort Earbuds Better Than AirPods?
The new earbuds aren’t out yet, but they do look like they could prove to be a challenger to the AirPods Pro. Bose's headphones appear to have many of the same features as the AirPods Pro, with well-fitting earpieces, noise-canceling, water-resistance, and an even longer battery life. The price point and additional features are not yet known, since Bose has yet to officially release the headphones.
Bose is likely to provide firm details on these headphones soon enough and they might not be the only option. The company has also added the Bose Sport Earbuds to the product support section of its UK website. Like the QuietComfort Earbuds, the Sport Earbuds are also understood to have undergone a name-change, considering they were previously called the Bose Earbuds 500. Both the Bose Noise Cancelling Earbuds 700 and the Bose Earbuds 500 were marked as “launching later in 2020” suggesting, that unless there are any major delays, they will likely launch soon. At which point, how the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds actually stand up to Apple's AirPods will become a little clearer.
