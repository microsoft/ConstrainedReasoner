As New York continues to gradually distribute coronavirus vaccines, questions about who can receive inoculations and where vaccination sites are located in Nassau County persist.
ELIGIBILITY:
As of Wednesday, eligibility for the vaccine was expanded to the following groups of people, according to state officials:
People 60 or older
Health care personnel
Teachers and child care workers
Hotel workers
Grocery store workers
Public transit workers
Long-term care facility residents and staff
People with conditions like cancer, kidney disease, pulmonary disease, liver disease, type 1 or 2 diabetes, intellectual or developmental disabilities, and co-morbidities
First responders and corrections workers
Restaurant and delivery workers.
VACCINATION SITES:
Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced last week that the thousands of vaccination sites throughout the state will be permitted to vaccinate any New Yorker who is eligible to receive the vaccine beginning Wednesday.
Nassau County Executive Laura Curran announced that the Nassau Coliseum will be turned into a mass vaccination site later this month. The announcement came after calls from the Nassau County Legislature to convert the venue into an inoculation center since January.
Vaccination sites throughout Nassau County include:
Jones Beach
Nassau Community College (Garden City)
Yes We Can Community Center (Westbury)
Northwell Health Physician Partners (Syosset)
Northwell Center for Advanced Medicine (Lake Success)
