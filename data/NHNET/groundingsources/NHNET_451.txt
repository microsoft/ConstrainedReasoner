THE OLD GUARD has become a popular viewing option on Netflix and it has left viewers wanting to know more about the history behind the characters and the mythology. Not to disappoint, Netflix has released a new video that details some of that history and fills in the blanks of the past that many have been curious about.
The video contains illustrations and information from "The Old Guard" comics (written by Greg Rucka) and confirms that Andy is over 6,000 years old. It also tells us more about how Andy and Quynh found Lykon, and where: during Alexander the Great’s conquest of Judea in 331 BC. We don’t know when exactly Lykon died, but this does give us more information about him. We also learn Joe and Nicky’s full names: Nicolo of Genoa and Yusuf Ibrahim Al-Kaysani, who met trying to kill each other in the Crusades and the siege of Jerusalem in 1099. Also fully named: Sébastien Lelivre, who was killed first in 1812 for attempted desertion of the Napoleonic army.
You can learn most of this from exploring "The Old Guard" comic books but this little trip down memory lane is perfect if comic books aren't your thing. It's easy enough to follow and gives you some backstory on characters you came to know while watching the film. That is the best thing about the film for me. It's a solid action movie with incredible stunt sequences but it's also rich in story and history that gives it more depth than most films of its type.
In the film, a covert team of immortal mercenaries are suddenly exposed and must now fight to keep their identity a secret just as an unexpected new member is discovered. The film stars Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Harry Melling, Van Veronica Ngo, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.
