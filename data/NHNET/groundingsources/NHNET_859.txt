A few seconds of screen time during the Super Bowl has everybody talking about John Travolta and his daughter, Ella. You may need a tissue for this one.
John Travolta And His Daughter Dance In Cute Super Bowl Ad
Grease is a movie that has always been and will always be relevant. The iconic soundtrack and outfits will live on in pop culture history forever. Not only that, but the film is still churning up controversy decades later.
In January 2021, Olivia Newton-John defended the film against critics who said it was "sexist." Then, Newton-John's co-star John Travolta and his daughter, Ella Travolta, paid homage to Grease in a Super Bowl commercial for Scotts Miracle-Gro, which aired in February 2021. Love it or loathe it, the staying power of this movie is undeniable.
In the Super Bowl ad, the father-daughter duo perform the same dance that John performed with Newton-John during the school dance scene in the movie. While the dancing is something that Grease fanatics can be excited about, the Scotts Miracle-Gro commercial has something (or someone) that appeals to just about everybody. The Travoltas co-star in the commercial with lifestyle guru Martha Stewart, NASCAR driver Kyle Busch, The Office star Leslie David Baker, former football pro Carl Weathers, and Peloton instructor Emma Lovewell, according to People.
The Travoltas first appear in the ad as the Saturday Night Fever alum struggles to set up a tripod camera while his daughter watches on with amusement. Once he gets the camera in place, they start dancing, which prompts Baker to tell them, "Hey Travoltas, don't be tikety-toking on my grass!" Though Baker seems "annoyed" by their dancing, Stewart seems amused by their performance, quipping, "He's still got it."
The high-profile commercial marks a special moment for John and Ella.
