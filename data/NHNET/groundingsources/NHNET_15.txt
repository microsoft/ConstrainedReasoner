Your morning guide: Rishi Sunak to extend furlough until autumn and Nicola Sturgeon faces calls to resign as witnesses back Salmond claims
Rishi Sunak will announce that the furlough scheme will continue until the autumn, even as data shows that efforts to counter Covid are exceeding expectations.

This is despite new analysis showing that the decline in coronavirus deaths in England is around three weeks ahead of the central modelling estimates, fuelling calls for a quicker reopening. All will be revealed when Mr Sunak delivers his Budget speech at about 12.45pm.
