French President Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the Elysee Palace said Thursday.
Macron took the test "as soon as the first symptoms appeared," the presidential palace said in statement, adding that he will be isolated for seven days in line with COVID-19 virus guidelines.
"He will continue to work and take care of his activities from a distance," it said.
It was not immediately clear where he had contracted the virus.
Macron is the third leader among the Group of Seven industrialized nations who has caught the virus, after U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Macron's wife Brigitte has also isolated herself in October after coming into contact with a COVID-19 carrier.
Amid a resurgence of the virus, France has recently imposed a nighttime curfew, even as it lifted restrictions on movement after about a month and a half.
