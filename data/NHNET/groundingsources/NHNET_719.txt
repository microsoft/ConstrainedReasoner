TMZ is reporting that Tory Lanez texted Megan Thee Stallion to apologize soon after a shooting that left her wounded in the foot.
Tory Lanez texted Megan Thee Stallion to apology hours after a shooting in July that left her wounded in the foot, according to a report in TMZ. Lanez was arrested soon after the shooting and charged with carrying a concealed weapon, and Megan Thee Stallion has since appeared on Instagram Live and claimed that it was Tory Lanez who shot her.

In the purported texts obtained by TMZ, Lanez does not directly address the shooting or any violent act but apologizes for the behavior he says was caused by alcohol intoxication. "I know u prolly never gone talk to me again," the message reads, "but I genuinely want u to know I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart…I was just too drunk…None the less shit should have never happened and I can’t change what did. I just feel horrible…Cuz I genuinely just got too drunk."
The texts were reportedly sent 15 hours after the shooting when Megan was still in the hospital. Megan did not respond to the messages, according to TMZ. She called the shooting "the worst experience of my life" in an Instagram Live session two weeks after the incident. Tory Lanez has not issued a public statement on the shooting.
