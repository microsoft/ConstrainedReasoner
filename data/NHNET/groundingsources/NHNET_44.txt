McLaren’s next generation has arrived with a fresh powertrain, chassis and tech, and will rival the 911 Turbo S
The key piece of news above all others is the introduction of a hybrid powertrain. For the first time in McLaren Automotive’s history, a new car from Woking isn’t powered by the venerable twin-turbo V8, but rather an all-new 2,993cc twin-turbo V6. This all-new engine is once once again developed with Riccardo, which is in turn boosted by an electric motor. The ‘M630’ V6 uses a 120-degree V angle, with the turbos mounted in the middle in the now familiar ‘hot V’ concept, and has been designed to be as compact as possible despite the wide cylinder bank angle, right down to the details of the cooling channels within the block. It’s also over 40kg lighter than the old V8. The reason is obvious: with the additional weight of the hybrid components and the space they take up, every last kilo and centimetre that can be saved counts, and indeed, it’s a philosophy McLaren has had to adopt throughout the design of the whole car.
The axial flux electric motor is mounted in the bell housing for the gearbox, not on the rear axle, with drive being deployed through a new eight-speed twin-clutch gearbox and then via an electronically controlled limited slip differential (another new development on a McLaren). The combination of engine and e-motor can produce 671bhp and 720Nm; broken down, that’s a peak of 577bhp and 584Nm from the engine, and 94bhp and 225Nm thanks to electricity, although the e-motor can only give the full 94bhp for 15 seconds hence power falling back to a total of 626bhp.
