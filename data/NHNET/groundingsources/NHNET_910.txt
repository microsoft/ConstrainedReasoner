Lee took to Twitter on Saturday to walk back his defense of Allen, who has been accused of molesting his adoptive daughter, Dylan Farrow, when she was seven years old.
Spike Lee has apologized for speaking up for Woody Allen — saying he was “wrong” for defending the filmmaker against “cancel” culture.
The “Do The Right Thing” director took to Twitter to walk back his defense of Allen, who has been accused of molesting his daughter, Dylan Farrow, when she was 7 years old.
“I deeply apologize. My words were wrong,” Lee tweeted Saturday. “I do not and will not tolerate sexual harassment, assault or violence. Such treatment causes real damage that can’t be minimized.”
Lee told Len Berman and Michael Riedel on 710 WOR’s “In The Morning, that his longtime friend was struggling with falling out of grace amid the #MeToo movement.
“I’d just like to say Woody Allen is a great, great filmmaker and this cancel thing is not just Woody,” Lee said on the show.
“And when we look back on it we are going to see that — short of killing someone — you can’t just erase someone like they never existed. Woody is a friend of mine … and I know he’s going through it right now.”
Allen has vigorously denied the allegations that he sexually abused Farrow in 1992, doubling down in his recent memoir “Apropos of Nothing.”
