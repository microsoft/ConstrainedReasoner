Veto showdown expected in NC legislature

NC Gov. vetoes bill that would allow bars to partially reopen (Friday)
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper had vetoed a bill that would allow bars to partially reopen and allow more restaurant capacity outside.
The state Senate and House voted last week to let bars serve customer outside, despite Cooper’s executive order.
Statement released from Gov. Cooper on House Bill 536:
“State and local government leaders must be able to act quickly during the COVID-19 emergency to prevent a surge in cases that could overwhelm hospitals and harm the public. House Bill 536 would limit the ability of leaders to respond quickly to COVID-19 and hamper the health and safety of every North Carolinian.”
