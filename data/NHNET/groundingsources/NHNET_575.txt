The anticipation for Season 6 of Fortnite is building to a fever pitch. Fortnite players are speculating about what will happen next in the battle royale game on social media. Season 6 is scheduled to premiere on March 16. That means things in Fortnite are going to get a lot crazier in the coming days. Epic Games isn’t wasting much time, as teasers for the start of Fortnite Season 6 have already been released.
The preview comes from Fortnite’s official Twitter account, and it’s exactly what a hint should be. It features Agent Jonesy’s “Reality Log” audio diary and some enigmatic photos floating in the background.
Jonesy discusses the current situation with Zero Point and recommends potential intervention, but he doesn’t specify what will happen next. That is something that the players will have to find out on their own.
In the trailer for Fortnite Season 6, there are two main points to take note of. The first is that the Zero Point has become absolutely dysfunctional and that if it worsens any more, something disastrous will arise.
The second is that Agent Jonesy is lashing out at the Imagined Order for doing nothing as the Zero Point spiraling out of reach. Furthermore, Agent Jonesy makes it known that he is no longer following the IO’s directives and will now take measures independently.
Agent Jonesy’s exact plans remain unclear due to the uncertainty surrounding his relationship with IO. Agent Jonesy is reported to have spent Season 5 collecting hunters in order to prevent people from breaking the Loop, which is a meta-reference to the time-loop that players experience when playing Fortnite. It’s also unclear how exiting the Loop through the Zero Point operates and what the Zero Point’s uncertainty means for the Loop and the players trapped within it.
To be sure, it’s a perplexing scenario on paper, but what matters is that Agent Jonesy’s teaser has a straightforward viewpoint on the situation that players should pursue. Through watching what Jonesy sees, Fortnite players will be able to comprehend what is going on. Or, at the very least, they can comprehend them to the extent that Epic Games desires.
Finally, Fortnite’s continuing narrative’s key goal is to create an enjoyable game with huge moments and plenty of surprises. It isn’t necessarily necessary for it to make sense. This teaser’s real worth is in that. It’s asking fans to anticipate March 16’s launch and the events leading up to it. Fortnite players should relax and take in the scenery.
