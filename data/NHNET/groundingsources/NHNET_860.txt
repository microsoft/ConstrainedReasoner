Giving details of the new restrictions after a high-level state Covid review meeting, an official spokesperson said fine for not following Covid-appropriate behaviour shall be hiked from the present Rs 500 to Rs 1,000.
Given the inflow of patients from Delhi for treatment in Punjab, it has also been decided to review and optimise the bed availability in the stateâ€™s private hospitals. The Chief Minister has asked Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan to work with the departments concerned to encourage more private hospitals to come on board and earmark beds for Covid care.
To further strengthen the availability of oxygen and ICU beds, Capt Amarinder has ordered strengthening level 2 and 3 hospitals, with constant monitoring of districts that are not equipped with level 3 facilities. The management practices at GMCHs and Civil Hospitals should also be examined in light of the recommendations of the report received from the expert group, he said.
The CM also directed the Health and Medical Education Departments to make emergency appointments of specialists, super-specialists, nurses and paramedics, to further augment the manpower which was recently strengthened with the recruitment of 249 specialist doctors and 407 medical officers.
The district hospitals must have 24 x 7 testing available, and it must also be made available at other convenient locations where people could easily access the same, the CM said.
To ensure that no deaths take place in home isolation, Capt Amarinder said the agency hired to look into these cases should keep a tab on such patients. While mortality audit was ongoing, it was a matter of satisfaction that the department was now collecting reasons for placing patients on ventilator by private hospitals, and there was a referral group available to monitor these patients, he said.
