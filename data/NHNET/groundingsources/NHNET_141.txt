A Norwegian MP has said he has nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in the Middle East.
Christian Tibering-JJD, a Norwegian Member of Parliament for the far-right Progressive Party, said: “Trump should be considered for his role in paving the way for peace in the Middle East for a peace deal between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. East ”.
“No matter what Trump says at home and what he says at the press conference, he has a good chance of winning the Nobel Peace Prize,” Tibering-JJD told the Associated Press.
He also said that Donald Trump meets the criteria for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Mr Tibering-JJD was one of two Norwegian MPs who nominated Trump for the 2018 Peace Prize for his efforts to bring about reconciliation between North and South Korea.
Any member of the National Assembly can nominate someone for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Unlike other Nobel Prizes awarded in neighboring Sweden, the award process takes place in Norway. Nominations must be submitted to the Norwegian Nobel Committee by February 1.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment publicly on the nominees. By law, the information must be kept confidential for 50 years.
Tiebring-JJD said in a Facebook post that the Nobel Committee can consider Trump’s achievements at the international level and that it does not stumble upon established prejudices against the US president.
Although Trump said last year that he deserves the Peace Prize for his work on North Korea and Syria, he complained that he would never receive this honor. Former US President Barack Obama, Trump’s enemy, won the award in 2009, months after he first took office.
Nominations for this year’s awards close on January 31 and the winner will be announced on October 9 in Oslo.
