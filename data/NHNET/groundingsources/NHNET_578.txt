The track dropped Juneteenth, along with a directory of Black galleries and businesses
Beyoncé has released a surprise new song, titled “Black Parade”. The track arrived yesterday, Juneteenth (June 19), a day that commemorates the end of slavery in the US, which the singer also acknowledged on a statement posted to her website.
“Happy Juneteenth,” the statement reads. “Being Black is your activism. Black excellence is a form of protest. Black joy is your right.”
This comes alongside a directory of Black-owned businesses in various fields – from art and design, to fashion, to restaurants and bars – described on the website as the “Black Parade Route”. All proceeds from the track will also go towards a fund for small, Black-owned businesses in need, through Beyonce’s foundation, BeyGood.
In April, Beyoncé also featured on a remix of Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage”, with all proceeds going towards the coronavirus response in the two artists’ hometown of Houston, Texas.
This came on the back of a $6 million donation from Beyoncé, to aid essential workers amid the crisis. More recently the singer has penned an open letter demanding justice for Breonna Taylor.
