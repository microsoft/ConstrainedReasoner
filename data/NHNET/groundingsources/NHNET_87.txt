Impact Wrestling
A bunch of wrestlers recently let go by WWE could be on their way to Impact Wrestling.
Last night's Impact on AXS TV featured a huge teaser vignette that directly addressed WWE's Black Wednesday (15 April) releases as a whiskey-drinking figure watched the story break on television, presented in a similar fashion to the recent SmackDown hacker segments. WWE's signature "future endeavours" line was dropped before pictures of EC3, Eric Young, Luke Gallows, Karl Anderson, Curt Hawkins, Mike and Maria Kanellis, and Drake Maverick all came across the screen.
Oh, and a Bulgarian flag too. Impact Wrestling are certified camps.

None of these wrestlers have been formally confirmed as signings though several have significant experience with Impact. EC3, Maverick (as Rockstar Spud), and Eric Young were effectively made in the promotion, while Mike and Maria Kanellis had a strong run there as well. Gallows and Anderson, meanwhile, are now the biggest free-agent tag team left on the market following #FTR's move to AEW.
The above wrestlers' non-compete clauses expire on 15 July, three days before Impact's Slammiversary pay-per-view. It'll be interesting to see how many (if any) of the teased names show up.
