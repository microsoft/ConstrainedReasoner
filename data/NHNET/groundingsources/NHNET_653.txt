To celebrate this Mother’s day with our community, all proceeds from the sale of this limited edition denim jacket will be donated to Help a Mother Out®, a non-profit organization in Oakland that works to improve baby and family well-being by increasing access to diapers for families in need. During this crisis, they have been instrumental in providing the necessary baby and infant essentials to mothers through partners like Oakland Unified School District, Alameda County Public Health, and Oakland Early Head Start. The jacket will be available tomorrow, 5/8 at 10am PST on the @eatlearnplay site!
