After numerous rumors and reports, especially regarding it skipping the last PS5 showcase, Square Enix finally announced Final Fantasy 16. The trailer showcased was on a PC emulating “the PS5 experience” but it’s a timed exclusive for PlayStation. Check it out below.
Touted as an all-new, standalone single-player action RPG, Final Fantasy 16 boasts real-time combat. It seems a lot more fast-paced than Final Fantasy 15 with traditional dodging mechanics, combos and magic. Of course, numerous Final Fantasy mainstays like Chocobos, Dragoons and more were also featured. The story seems to focus on a young member of royalty named Joshua, who seems to be hiding powers far beyond his control.
Overall, the visual fidelity looks very good with Square Enix choosing a fantasy medieval setting this time around. Final Fantasy 16 doesn’t have a release date but it’s also coming to PC along with PS5. Stay tuned for more details in the coming months, as well as other announcements from Sony’s PS5 showcase.
