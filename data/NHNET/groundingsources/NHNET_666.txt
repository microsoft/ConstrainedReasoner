Due to the rapid movement of the system, Zeta won’t have much time to weaken over inland Alabama. And, that fast forward motion will also add to the wind potential of the system. Accordingly, this now looks like it has potential to be a high impact wind event for inland parts of Alabama late tonight; sustained winds of 25-45, with gusts to 65 mph in a few places south of I-59. This will bring the potential for significant tree and power line damage to much of the state late tonight.
