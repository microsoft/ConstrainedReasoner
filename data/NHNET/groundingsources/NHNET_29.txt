In the official trailer, we see Paper Mario approach an Origami-folded Princess Peach in her castle. Peach acts a bit unusual, though. She asks Mario if he will crease himself and be reborn, like herself. His answer of “no” sends him falling through the floor.
Peach’s castle is taken over by King Olly, according to the Paper Mario website, and it’s up to Mario to save the day. Mario will use a brand new ability called 1,000-Fold Arms, which will allow him to extend his arms to solve puzzles along the journey.
In Paper Mario: The Origami King, Mario will join a new partner named Olivia. The two will team up with unlikely allies (even with Bowser!) in order to take down King Olly and this new threat to the kingdom.
Paper Mario: The Origami King will have players lining up their enemies in a brand new ring-based system of battle. Fighting enemies will require both good puzzle-solving skills and quick thinking; the more enemies lined up in a row, the more effective Mario’s attacks will be.
The Origami King will be the sixth Paper Mario game, first new game in the series since Color Splash released on the Wii U in 2016.
The best news of all is that we won’t have to wait too long to play this brand new Paper Mario adventure. The Origami King will release on the Nintendo Switch on July 17, 2020 for $59.99.
