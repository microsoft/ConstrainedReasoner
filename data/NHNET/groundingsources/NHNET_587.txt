Sharing the news on the microblogging website, Diljit wrote: "TERE CONCERT CH AVAN PA KE KURTA PAJAMA NI #rihanna (sic)," followed by a heart emoji.
“RiRi” song tells how Dosanjh loves Rihanna, her beauty, and her massive fan following across the globe. The music of the song is similar to his other Punjabi track and features several shots from the pop star’s music videos and concerts.
The video has garnered over 10 lakh views since its release.

While Diljit Dosanjh has gone ahead and made a video on Rihanna, Bollywood actor Abhay Deol feels that his co-stars Taapsee Pannu, Swara Bhasker, and jewelry designer Farah Khan Ali should be cast by Rihanna in her next music video.
The reason for Abhay Deol appreciating these three celebrities? Because they were the only ones who actually supported Rihanna and the farmer's protest from Bollywood.
Abhay wrote in an Instagram post, "The popular expression, 'having the b@!!$' means to say 'having the courage.' Looking at these lovely ladies' media feed and I think we should replace 'b@!!$' with 'V@£!/@' @taapsee, @farahkhanali @reallyswara ya'll should be in the next @badgalriri video! Right wing trolls in 3, 2, 1."
Both videos call for a must-watch.
