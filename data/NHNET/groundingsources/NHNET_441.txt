Starting Monday, March 8 South Carolinians in Phase 1b can begin receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
Essentially, the state is moving to what was previously known as Phase 1C with some exceptions. The majority of the state will now be eligible for vaccinations.

People aged 16-64 with one or more of the following high-risk medical conditions:

Frontline workers with increased occupational risk
Frontline workers with increased occupational risk are people who:
Must be in-person at their place of work, and perform a job that puts them at increased risk of exposure due to their frequent, close (less than 6 feet) and ongoing (more than 15 minutes) contact with others in the work environment
Teachers will also be included in Phase 1B. The move comes exactly a week after lawmakers backed off moving teachers to Phase 1A when DHEC said they wouldn't get full protection until the school year ended.
