ATLANTA — Pretty soon you may not get your Amazon package from a delivery truck, but a robot instead.
The retail giant announced Tuesday that Amazon Scout, a “fully-electric delivery system designed to safely get packages to customers using autonomous delivery devices,” will start delivering packages in Atlanta.
The robots are about the size of a cooler, and are designed to navigate around pets, people and other objects as it makes its delivery.
“From surfboards, to luggage, to refrigerators, and even Christmas trees waiting to be picked up for recycling — our autonomous devices have navigated around all types of objects on the sidewalk,” the company said in its blog.
