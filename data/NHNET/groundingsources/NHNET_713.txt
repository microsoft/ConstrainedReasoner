Ahead of Apple's product event next week, where it is expected to unveil a new Apple Watch, iPad and perhaps new AirPods, Bose announced its own wireless earbuds as well as sunglasses with integrated speakers.
Privately held Framingham, Ma.-based Bose unveiled the noise-canceling QuietComfort Earbuds and the less expensive Sports Earbuds. The two new products, which are available for pre-order today and go on sale Sept. 29, will retail for $279 and $179, respectively.
“We spent a lot of time making sure our new QuietComfort Earbuds were the most effective noise cancelling in-ear headphones ever,” said Mehul Trivedi, category director, Bose wearable audio, in a statement. “But they also sound incredible and are a pleasure to wear and use. That’s an unbeatable combination that puts them ahead of the industry and makes them every bit a QuietComfort.”

When factoring in price, the QuietComfort Earbuds appear poised to compete with Apple's AirPods Pro and Beats Powerbeats Pro, which both retail for $249.

The QuietComfort Earbuds have six hours of continuous listening, with another 12 from the charging case. In comparison, the AirPods Pro have up to five hours of listening time on a single charge, but up to 24 hours of listening time with the case.
The new QuietComfort Earbuds will come in two colors, Triple Black and Soapstone.
