NASA is keeping a close eye on a massive asteroid leading up to the weekend, according to a report by the UK's Daily Times. The asteroid is estimated to be between 820 feet and 1,870 feet, making it potentially taller than the Empire State Building at 1,453 feet, and it's traveling at a speed of 11,200 miles per hour. Scientists don't expect the asteroid to collide with Earth, rather it should zoom safely past, but they will keep an eye on it in case it enters Earth's atmosphere.

The asteroid is estimated to be between 820 feet and 1,870 feet, making it potentially taller than the Empire State Building at 1,453 feet, and it's traveling at a speed of 11,200 miles per hour.
Scientists don't expect the asteroid to collide with Earth, rather it should zoom safely past, but they will keep an eye on it in case it enters Earth's atmosphere.
The expectation is that the space rock will miss our planet by over 3-million miles when it flies past on Sat., June 6.
This big asteroid is the final of five expected to fly past Earth this week.
