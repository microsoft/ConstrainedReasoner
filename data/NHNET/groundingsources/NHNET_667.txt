In an Instagram post this week, superstar Indian actress Priyanka Chopra announced she will open Sona, a restaurant in New York City's Flatiron district. Helmed by Chef Hari Nayak, who has led teams at acclaimed restaurants around the world such as Jhol in Bangkok, Masti in Dubai, and Charcoza in Riyadh, Sona will serve "timeless Indian" cuisine.
"I'm thrilled to present to you Sona, a new restaurant in NYC that I poured my love for Indian food into," Chopra wrote on Instagram. "Sona is the very embodiment of timeless India and the flavours I grew up with.
"Sona is opening later this month, and I can't wait to see you there! This endeavour would not have been possible without the leadership of my friends Maneesh Goyal and David Rabin. Thank you to our designer Melissa Bowers and the rest of the team for realizing this vision so clearly."
Goyal is an entrepreneur and the CEO of Pineapple Co.; Rabin is a longtime New York restaurateur and nightlife owner-operator, and the former president of the New York Nightlife Association.
