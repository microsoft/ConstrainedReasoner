Move aside Jennifer Aniston, thereâ€™s a new Instagram record-breaker in town.
Sir David Attenborough has broken the record for the fastest time to reach one million followers on Instagram, reaching the milestone in just over four hours, according to the Guinness World Records.
That means the 94-year-old naturalist has surpassed the previous record set by Aniston, who reached the one milly mark in five hours and 16 minutes. Before that, the record was five hours and 45 minutes, set by none other than Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
Since joining Instagram 24 hours ago, Attenborough has racked up 2.7 million followers. His first ever post gained a whopping 10,257,883 views. Pretty impressive tbh.
The veteran broadcaster joined the social media platform for a really important reason, too. "This is my first time on Instagram," Attenborough said in his first ever Insta video. "And I'm making this move and exploring this new way of communication to me, because as we all know, the world is in trouble. Continents are on fire. Glaciers are melting. Coral reefs are dying. Fish are disappearing from our oceans. The list goes on and on and on."
Attenborough plans to use his account to share important messages about saving the planet and possible solutions for tackling climate change. Jonnie Hughes and Colin Butfield, who worked on Attenborough's upcoming Netflix film and book A Life On Our Planet, are helping to manage the account.
Congrats, Sir David, on your record-breaking achievement!
