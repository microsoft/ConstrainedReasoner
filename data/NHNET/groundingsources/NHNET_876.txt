A statewide tornado drill is planned for 1 p.m. Wednesday in conjunction with Severe Weather Awareness Week, which runs March 21 to 27.
The annual initiative aims to educate the public about severe weather safety and spark a broader conversation about emergency preparedness.
During the drill, counties across the state, including St. Clair County, will activate their sirens for three minutes as a test of the warning network. Residents will observe or hear alerts on NOAA weather radios, TV and radio stations.
On average, Michigan has 15 tornadoes per year, according to the Michigan State Police. Tornadoes are known to develop rapidly, with little advanced warning. The average lead time for a tornado warning is 10 minutes to 15 minutes, and winds can reach over 200 mph.
Michigan residents are encouraged to prepare and make a plan before a tornado strikes and to review and update their plans during the annual statewide tornado drill.
“Tornadoes can happen at any time but are more prevalent in late spring and early summer. It’s important that your household or business has a plan to react quickly,” said Capt. Kevin Sweeney, deputy state director of Emergency Management and commander of the MSP/EMHSD. “This year, we are asking that large groups not shelter in place together during the drill, but to instead use the opportunity to go over their emergency plans and update them if necessary.”
In the event of severe weather, siren activation for a steady three minutes means a tornado warning has been issued for the area, and residents should tune to local media for specific information regarding severe weather and additional instructions.
MSP offered the following tips to prepare for a tornado:
* Know the difference: Tornado watch means conditions exist for a tornado to develop; tornado warning means a tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar.
* Know the signs of an approaching tornado: dark, often greenish sky; large hail; a large, dark low-lying cloud, and loud roar, like a freight train.
* Develop an emergency preparedness kit with essential items such as a three-day supply of water and food, a NOAA weather radio, important family documents and items that satisfy unique family needs.
* Conduct regular tornado drills. Make sure each household member knows where to go and what to do in the event of a tornado.
* Stay tuned to commercial radio or television broadcasts for news on changing weather conditions or approaching storms.
