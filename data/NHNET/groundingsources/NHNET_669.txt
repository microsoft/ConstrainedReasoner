SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- Apple on Tuesday unveiled Apple Watch Series 6, Apple Watch SE, two new iPad models, and Apple One subscription plans during its virtual September 2020 event.
Apple Watch Series 6 can measure the oxygen saturation of users' blood, so the users may better understand their overall fitness and wellness.
To compensate for natural variations in the skin and improve accuracy, the Blood Oxygen sensor employs four clusters of green, red and infrared LEDs, along with the four photodiodes on the back crystal of Apple Watch, to measure light reflected back from blood, the company demonstrated.
Apple Watch uses a custom algorithm built into the Blood Oxygen app to measure blood oxygen between 70 percent and 100 percent.
Its new operating system "watchOS 7" also brings new features such as Family Setup, sleep tracking, automatic handwashing detection, new workout types, and the ability to curate and share watch faces, the company said.

Apple Watch SE features the same accelerometer, gyroscope and always-on altimeter as Apple Watch Series 6, and with the latest motion sensors and microphone. It offers robust health and safety capabilities including fall detection, Emergency SOS, international emergency calling, and the Noise app, the company said.
"Apple Watch SE combines elements of the Series 6 design with the most essential features of Apple Watch, all at a more affordable price," said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer.
