The killer from American Murder is said to be in “anguish” over the Netflix documentary's existence.

In 2018, he pleaded guilty to multiple counts of first-degree murder as part of a plea deal, and is currently serving five life sentences without the possibility of parole.
American Murder: The Family Next Door has been Netflix’s most-viewed title since its release last week.
It has been praised by viewers including Shan'ann's brother, Frankie Rzucek, who said: “It shows what her life was like before [Chris] came along, and how happy she was with her beautiful family until he cheated and turned into a different person and became that monster.”
According to People, a friend of Watts’ said that “he hates knowing that it's out there” and “that he will never see it”.
They added: “Just knowing that the documentary is out there has sent Chris to some dark places.”

Watts was having an affair with a co-worker at the time of the murder.
