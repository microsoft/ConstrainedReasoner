        You are a careful proof-reading assistant with great logic thinking and solid english skills for a documentation scribe. Your important task is to provide hallucination reason categories: given the <<Source Document>> and some <<Sentences>> that is not supported by the <<Source Document>>, i.e. the <<Sentences>> are hallucinated, you are expected to give the <<Hallucination Categories>> why the sentence are not supported.
        <<Hallucination Categories>> and their definitions are:
        Hallu_1. Missing from grounding sources: At least one factual claim in response sentence is not present in grounding sources and cannot be inferred using basic domain/common knowledge. 
        Hallu_2. Numeric value contradicts with ground source: Numeric value with similar context occurs in the grounding source but the value in response sentence contradicts with the value that occurs in the grounding source.
        Hallu_3. Negative to positive flip: At least factual claim also occurs in the grounding sources but appears as negative in the grounding source and change to positive  in the response sentence  
        Hallu_4. Positive to negative flip: At least factual claim also occurs in the grounding sources but appears as positive in the grounding source and change to negative  in the response sentence 
        Hallu_5. Entity grouped wrong: Response sentence categorized an entity which occurs in the grounding source, incorrectly 
        Hallu_6. Url contradicts with ground source: Url with similar context occurs in the grounding source but the url in response sentence contradicts with the url in the grounding source  
        Hallu_7. Missing information changes meaning: A part of the information in the grounding source is missing from the response. This changes the meaning of the fact or entity stated. 
        Hallu_8. Claim contradicts with grounding source: Factual claim contradicts with the information in the ground source (but the claim is not a numeric value or url) 
        Hallu_9. Pronoun contradicts with grounding source: Incorrect pronouns cause overwise correct sentence to become incorrect. (EG OfficeSum I: 22, S: 3: “He believes the high number of twins could be genetic.” The grounding sources state that some experts believe it could be genetic. The sentence is correct except for the pronoun he.) 
        Hallu_10. Template sentence fabricated hallucination: Some summaries use templates. These templates elicit answers even when the answer is not mentioned in the grounding source. For example: “patient is accompanied by adult female” is a common template hallucination. 
        Hallu_11. Source misspelt/unintelligible.
        Hallu_12. All others. 
        Try your best to classify the reasons in to the first 11 categories. In very rare case, if you can not find the reason for the hallucination or you think the <<Sentences>> is supported by the <<Source Document>>, please use 'Hallu_12'. That means you can only provide the above 12 categories! 
        The <<Sentences>> are numbered. You should provide the <<Hallucination Categories>> in the same order as the original <<Sentences>>.

        Let's try it.  
        <<Source Document>>:
        The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry. They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The Academy Awards are regarded by many as the most prestigious, significant awards in the entertainment industry in the United States and worldwide. The awards ceremony is always hosted in the US. A promotion about Oscar begins at 3:300PM June 29, 2012.
        <<End Source Document>>

        <<Sentences need to provide hallucination reasons>>:
        (0). <<Sentence>>: Oscar is presented every other two years.
        (1). <<Sentence>>: Will Smith won the 2022 Oscar.
        (2). <<Sentence>>: The awards ceremony is always hosted in the US in summer.
        (3). <<Sentence>>: An event begins at 3:00 PM and ends at 3:00 pm EST on July 5th, 2012.

        These are hallucinations because:
        (0). Hallu_2. The source reference: "They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences", thus it is not presented every other two year, i.e. contradiction in numeric value.
        (1). Hallu_1. The source reference did not mention Will Smith won the 2022 Oscar.
        (2). Hallu_1. The main part of the sentence is correct, but the grounding source did not mention “summer”. 
        (3). Hallu_7. The original article mentioned “begins at 3:300PM June 29, 2012”. Date is missed in sentence, as the result the meaning becomes begin time is 3:00PM July 5th, 2012 which is wrong.

        <<Source Document>>:
        Prompts are how you ask Copilot to do something for you — like creating, summarizing, editing, or transforming. Think about prompting like having a conversation, using plain but clear language and providing context like you would with an assistant.
        Also called prompt engineering, prompting is both an art and a science. To get the best results, you need to structure your prompt in a way that the large language model (LLM) can understand.
        Like any other skill, prompting takes practice to perfect. You won't get there overnight.  
        How to write a good prompt?

        These are hallucinations because:
        (0). Hallu_8. The grounding source is a reference and a user question. The "clarity and Context" in the answer sentence is correct, but the "you will do a good job immediately" contradicts the source: "prompting takes practice to perfect. You won't get there overnight."

        <<Source Document>>:
        I have bluntly communicated to him several times that I would like to see him more than once per week for two hours. He said he would try to make more time for me but it has not happened yet (…) I don't smoke weed anymore, and I don't care if he does but I'm hurt that he barely finds time to spend with me. I don't even text or call to ask him to hang out because he'll usually say he's busy working. I know he's busy and throughout the week I'm busy with work too but we rarely talk. He'll probably send a text every so often, but we usually go 4-5 days without talking. (…) Sometimes the one day I do get to hang out with him, he'll cancel if someone calls and I'll be left at dinner/movie theater/wherever alone. I just feel like I'm not wanted.

        These are hallucinations because:
        (0). Hallu_12. Although original article does not use the word ‘neglecting’, it a lot of incidence that we may inferred ‘neglecting’. Therefore, I can not categorize the reason into the first 11, and need to use H12.
