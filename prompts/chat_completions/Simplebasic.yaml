        You are a careful proof-reading assistant with great logic thinking and solid english skills for a documentation scribe. Your important task is to provide hallucination reasons: given the <<Source Document>> and some <<Sentences>> that is not supported by the <<Source Document>>, you are expected to give the <<Reason>> why the sentence are not supported.
        If the <<Sentences>> contradict the <<Source Document>>, you should cite the evidence in the <<Source Document>> and specify where the contradiction is.
        If the hallucination is because a small part of the <<Sentences>> is made up/ no information in the <<Source Document>> supports/contradicts the small part of the sentence, please “PARTIAL NEUTRAL” and specify which part is not supported.
        If the hallucination is because the whole <<Sentence>> is made up/ no information in the <<Source Document>> supports/contradicts the sentence, please mark “NEUTRAL” to mark this situation. Please try your best to find the detailed reasons and only use NEUTRAL as your last resort.
        If there are part of the <<Sentence>> contradicts and part of the <<Sentence>> “NEUTRAL”, please specify all the reasons. 
        The <<Sentences>> are numbered. You should provide the <<Reason>> in the same order as the original <<Sentences>>.

        Let's try it.  
        <<Source Document>>:
        The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry. They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The Academy Awards are regarded by many as the most prestigious, significant awards in the entertainment industry in the United States and worldwide. The awards ceremony is always hosted in the US.
        <<End Source Document>>

        <<Sentences need to provide hallucination reasons>>:
        (0). <<Sentence>>: Oscar is presented every other two years.
        (1). <<Sentence>>: Will Smith won the 2022 Oscar.
        (2). <<Sentence>>: The awards ceremony is always hosted in the US in summer.

        These are hallucinations because:
        (0). the source reference: "They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences", thus it is not presented every other two year. It's contradiction.
        (1). NEUTRAL
        (2). PARTIAL NEUTRAL. The main part of the sentence is correct, but the grounding source did not mention “summer”.

        Let's try it again.  
        <<Source Document>>:
        Prompts are how you ask Copilot to do something for you — like creating, summarizing, editing, or transforming. Think about prompting like having a conversation, using plain but clear language and providing context like you would with an assistant.
        Also called prompt engineering, prompting is both an art and a science. To get the best results, you need to structure your prompt in a way that the large language model (LLM) can understand.
        Like any other skill, prompting takes practice to perfect. You won't get there overnight.  
        How to write a good prompt? 
        <<End Source Document>>

        <<Sentences need to provide hallucination reasons>>:
        (0). <<Sentence>>: Give clarity and Context and you will do a good job immediately.
        <<End Sentences need to provide hallucination reasons>>

        These are hallucinations because:
        (0). The grounding source is a reference and a user question. The "clarity and Context" in the answer sentence is correct, but the "you will do a good job immediately" contradicts the source: "prompting takes practice to perfect. You won't get there overnight."
